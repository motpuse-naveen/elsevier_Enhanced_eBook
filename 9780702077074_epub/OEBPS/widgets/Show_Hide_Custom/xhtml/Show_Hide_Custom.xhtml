                                          Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is caused by a gastrin-producing endocrine
                                          tumor, which is usually in the pancreas or small bowel and leads to
                                          marked hyperacidity. This syndrome usually gives rise to severe peptic
                                          ulcer disease with multiple, concomitant duodenal ulcers that are
                                          resistant to conventional acid suppressive therapy. The other conditions
                                          listed are not known to be associated with an increased risk for peptic
                                          ulcer.

                                    <div class="c-ans-details">Over-the-counter NSAID use is very common, in
                                          particularly in elderly patients. Patients often do not recognize that
                                          they use NSAIDs even when specifically asked. Targeted questioning and
                                          checking of home medication is therefore indicated. In some series,
                                          surreptitious use of NSAIDs or aspirin was found as the underlying cause
                                          in 30 to 60% of patients with previously unexplained peptic ulcer.

                                    <div class="c-ans-details"><i>H. pylori</i>−related ulcers have considerably
                                          decreased in developed countries owing to a decrease in the declining
                                          prevalence of the bacterium in recent generations and the use of
                                          eradication therapy. ICU-related stress ulcers have become less common
                                          owing to improvements in overall management, including respiratory and
                                          hemodynamic care, acid inhibition, and emphasis on adequate feeding.
                                          NSAID use has become more common and has given rise to an increase of
                                          NSAID-related ulcer disease.

                                    <div class="c-ans-details"> Peptic ulcer is more common in men and in elderly
                                          people. Anti-TNF-α treatment is not causally related to peptic ulcer
                                          disease, and most patients with peptic ulcers do not develop gastric
                                          cancer. In <i>H. pylori</i>−positive subjects, however, smoking
                                          increases the risk for peptic ulceration. This increased relative risk
                                          has been reported to be up to 12-fold.

                                          pernicious anemia, gastric atrophy is caused by an autoimmune gastritis.
                                          However, this inflammation is not associated with peptic ulcer disease.
                                          Autoimmune inflammation of the small bowel due to celiac disease also
                                          does not cause ulceration. Various infectious conditions can give rise
                                          to peptic ulcer, but cryptococcosis is not one of them. Systemic
                                          vasculitides can be associated with peptic ulcers, but they are not a
                                          common presenting manifestation of scleroderma. Systemic mastocytosis
                                          is, however, associated with a clearly increased risk for peptic
                                          ulceration.

                                          recurrent ulcer complications. Patients with previous peptic ulcer
                                          bleeding in the presence of <i>H. pylori</i> therefore always need to be
                                          assessed to document the success of eradication therapy. If treatment
                                          has failed, they need repeat eradication treatment.

                                    <div class="c-ans-details">In patients with peptic ulcer bleeding, endoscopic
                                          treatment is the mainstay to stop ongoing bleeding and reduce the risk
                                          for rebleeding. Preemptive PPI therapy reduces the need for endoscopic
                                          treatment, but it has no effect on rebleeding and mortality. High-dose
                                          continuous intravenous PPI treatment reduces the risk for rebleeding,
                                          the need for blood transfusion, and mortality in patients with a high
                                          risk for rebleeding. The Blatchford scale can be used to predict the
                                          need for intervention, such as endoscopic treatment and blood
                                          transfusion; a low score is associated with a low chance that an
                                          intervention is needed. Patients with recurrent bleeding despite
                                          endoscopic and PPI treatment can often first be retreated
                                          endoscopically. If this retreatment fails, both angiographic
                                          embolization of the feeding vessel and surgery are alternative rescue
                                          treatments. Recurrent bleeding is thus not a routine indication for
                                          surgery.
