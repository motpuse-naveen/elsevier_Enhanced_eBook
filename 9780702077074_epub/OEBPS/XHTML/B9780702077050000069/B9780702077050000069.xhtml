It is sometimes called involuntary because it is regulated by the autonomic nervous system, hormones and/or local mediators, and is not under voluntary, conscious control. Its function, ultrastructure, development and activation mechanisms are distinct from striated muscles (cardiac and skeletal muscle). As smooth muscle forms a critical component of the cardiovascular system, the first part of this chapter deals with the basic structure, operation and activation mechanisms of generic smooth muscle. This is followed by a description of the various components of the vasculature and lymphatic systems, including signalling pathways, the roles of smooth muscle, the endothelium which lines the lumen of all vessels, and other cell types, and the interaction between cells and tissues. Finally, the structure, function and excitation–contraction pathways of cardiac muscle is described. Some examples of important pathological changes in structure and/or function are included throughout.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">blood vessels; cardiac muscle; cardiovascular system; endothelium; excitation–contraction coupling; lymphatics; smooth muscle</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The cardiovascular system carries blood from the heart to all parts of the body through a series of tubes, all but the smallest of which are muscular. The muscle in these tubes is of two types: smooth muscle is characteristic of the walls of blood vessels, whereas cardiac muscle provides the walls of the heart chambers with their powerful contractile pumping action. The general characteristics and classification of muscle tissues are given on <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#pg107">p. 107</a>.

Smooth muscle is also referred to as involuntary muscle because its activity is neither initiated nor monitored consciously. It is much more variable, in both form and function, than either striated or cardiac muscle, a reflection of its varied roles in different systems of the body.</div><div class="text" id="p0020">Smooth muscle is typically found in the walls of tubular structures and hollow viscera. It regulates diameter (e.g. in blood vessels, and branches of the bronchial tree); propels liquids or solids (e.g. in the ureter, hepatic duct and intestines); or expels contents (e.g. in the urinary bladder and uterus). The actual arrangement of the cells varies with the tissue. The account that follows will therefore be concerned with the generic properties of smooth muscle. The more specialized morphologies of smooth muscle are described in the appropriate regional chapters.</div><section><a id="s0015"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0025">Microstructure of smooth muscle</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0030">Smooth muscle cells (fibres) are smaller than those of striated muscle.

The nucleus is single, located at the midpoint, and often twisted into a corkscrew shape by the contraction of the cell. Smooth muscle cells align with their long axes parallel and staggered longitudinally, so that the wide central portion of one cell lies next to the tapered end of another. Such an arrangement achieves both close packing and a more efficient transfer of force from cell to cell. In transverse section, smooth muscle is seen as an array of circular or slightly polygonal profiles of very varied size, and nuclei are present only in the centres of the largest profiles (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 6.2</span></a>).

Each cell is covered almost entirely by a prominent basal lamina, which merges with a reticular layer consisting of a network of fine elastin, reticular fibres (collagen type III) and type I collagen fibres (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 6.3</span></a>).

Whilst less studied than that of endothelial cells, the smooth muscle cell glycocalyx has been shown to be important for mechanotransduction in small blood vessels. There are also a number of cell membrane-spanning proteins that extend through the glycocalyx and interact with the extracellular matrix, including cadherins and integrins. These provide structural and signalling links with the extracellular matrix and other cells, e.g. at desmosomes. The cytosolic ends of these proteins interact with components of the cytoskeleton via a complex of other proteins and kinases, and provide an important signalling pathway linking cell function to the exterior, which can modulate, for example, gene transcription and phenotype (<a href="#bib48" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_48">Stegemann 2005</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0045">Discontinuities occur in the basal lamina between adjacent cells, and here the cell membranes approach to 2–4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>nm of one another to form a gap junction (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 6.2</a>). These junctions are structurally similar to their counterparts in cardiac muscle, and are formed by binding of adjacent connexon complexes on the surface of the two cells. They provide a low-resistance channel through which electrical excitation and small molecules can pass, e.g. enabling a coordinated wave of contraction. The incidence of gap junctions varies with the anatomical site of the tissue: they appear more abundant in the type of smooth muscle that generates rhythmic (phasic) activity. In addition, they link the endothelium functionally with the underlying smooth muscle (via myoendothelial gap junctions) in small resistance arteries and arterioles.</div><div class="text" id="p0050">Caveolae, cup-like invaginations of the plasma membrane with a resemblance to endocytotic vesicles, are a characteristic feature of smooth muscle cells, and may form up to 30% of the membrane (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 6.4</a>). They are associated with many receptors, ion channels, kinases and the peripheral sarcoplasmic reticulum, and may thus act as highly localized <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="129" id="pagebreak_129"/><a id="pg129"/>signalling microdomains. They may also act as specialized pinocytotic structures involved in fluid and electrolyte transport into the cell. Other organelles (mitochondria, ribosomes, etc.) are largely confined to the filament-free perinuclear cytoplasm, although in some smooth muscle types, including vascular smooth muscle, peripheral mitochondria, sarcoplasmic reticulum and sarcolemma form important signalling microdomains.</div><div class="text" id="p0055">In some blood vessels, notably those of the pulmonary circulation, and in the airways and probably in other smooth muscle types, there is evidence for heterogeneity of cell phenotype. The smooth muscle cells of small blood vessels and bronchioles exhibit different functional properties from those in larger vessels and airways, and may differ in morphology, expression of signalling proteins such as ion channels, and excitation–contraction coupling mechanisms. Even within individual tissues there is evidence of heterogeneity. Some myofibroblast-like cells have a function that is more secretory than contractile. The secretory phenotype is often increased in disease (e.g. chronic severe asthma, pulmonary hypertension) and is associated with increased proliferation and remodelling, and with secretion of cytokines and other mediators. Many smooth muscles seem to exhibit considerable phenotypic plasticity between these contractile and secretory phenotypes (<a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_26">Halayko and Solway 2001</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0030">Neurovascular supply of smooth muscle</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0035">Vascular supply</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0025"/><div class="textfl" id="p0060">The blood supply of smooth muscle is less extensive than that of striated muscle.

However, unlike striated muscle, capillaries are not found in relation to individual cells.</div></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0040">Innervation</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0065">Smooth muscle may contract in response to nervous or hormonal stimulation, mechanical deformation, or electrical depolarization transferred from neighbouring cells. Some muscles receive a dense innervation to all cells and are often referred to as multi-unit smooth muscles: most blood vessels are of this type. Such innervation can precisely define contractile activity, e.g. in the iris, specific nervous control can produce either pupillary constriction or dilation. Other muscles are more sparsely innervated and have been referred to as unitary smooth muscles. They tend to display myogenic activity, initiated spontaneously or in response to stretch, which may be markedly influenced by hormones. In these muscles, which include those in the walls of the gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder, ureter, uterus and uterine tube, innervation tends to exert a more global influence on the rate and force of intrinsically generated contractions. The terms multi-unit and unitary smooth muscles are widely used, but in practice such distinctions are better regarded as the extremes of a continuous spectrum.</div><div class="text" id="p0070">Smooth muscles are innervated by unmyelinated axons with cell bodies located in autonomic ganglia, either in the sympathetic chain or, in the case of parasympathetic fibres, closer to the point of innervation (<a href="#f0030"><span class="bold">Fig. 6.5</span></a>). They ramify extensively, spreading over a large area of the muscle and sending branches into the muscle fasciculi. The terminal portion of each axonal branch is beaded and consists of expanded portions, varicosities, packed with vesicles and mitochondria, separated by thin, intervaricose portions. Each varicosity is regarded as a transmitter release site and may be considered as a nerve ending in the functional sense. In this way the axonal arborization of a single autonomic neurone bears a very large number of nerve endings (up to tens of thousands), as opposed to a maximum of a few hundred in somatic motor neurones.

This depends on the interaction of two systems of filaments, one forming the cytoskeleton and the other the contractile apparatus.</div><div class="text" id="p0090">Excluding the perinuclear region, the cytoplasm of a smooth muscle cell effectively consists of two structural domains. The cytoskeleton forms a structural framework that maintains the spindle-like form of the cell and provides an internal scaffold with which other elements can interact. Its major structural component is the intermediate filament desmin, with the addition of vimentin (which may also be present alone) in vascular smooth muscle. The intermediate filaments are arranged mainly in longitudinal bundles, but some filaments interconnect the bundles with each other and with the sarcolemma to form a three-dimensional network. The bundles of intermediate filaments insert into focal, electron-dense bodies, approximately 0.1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm in diameter, which are distributed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm and also attach to dense plaques underlying the plasma membrane (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 6.3A</a>). The cytoplasmic dense bodies and submembraneous dense plaques are equivalent to the Z-discs of striated muscle cells. They contain the actin-binding protein α-actinin <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="130" id="pagebreak_130"/><a id="pg130"/>and thus also anchor the actin filaments of the contractile apparatus. These form a lattice of obliquely arranged bundles throughout the cytoplasm, which transmit force to the plasma membrane and thus the basal lamina and extracellular matrix via dense plaques. These are associated with a highly structured arrangement of ancillary proteins, including vinculin and talin, which in turn attach to integrins that cross the membrane and provide attachment to components of the extracellular matrix (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Gunst and Zhang 2008</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0095">An analogous arrangement underlies cell–cell attachment at desmosomes, but here the attachment between dense plaques is provided by transmembrane cadherin glycoproteins and intracellular catenins instead of integrins and talin. Mechanical deformation of the cell may be linked to cell signalling mechanisms via focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and its substrate paxillin; phosphorylation of talin and paxillin may modulate the deformability of the smooth muscle cell. Other regulatory proteins also associate specifically with actin, such as caldesmon and calponin. The cytoskeleton is not a passive structure. It adapts dynamically to load and is modulated by cell surface receptors including integrins and agonist binding to G-protein coupled receptors, and so contributes to contraction (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Gunst and Zhang 2008</a>). This presumably contributes to the low energy requirements of smooth muscle contraction because dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton following active contraction allows cell shortening to be maintained without further energy expenditure.</div><div class="text" id="p0100">The ratio of actin to myosin is about eight times greater in smooth compared to striated muscle, reflecting the greater length of actin filaments in smooth muscle. Smooth muscle myosin filaments are 1.5–2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm long, somewhat longer than those of striated muscle, and are formed of a slower isoform of myosin. Although smooth muscle cells contain less myosin, the longer filaments are capable of generating considerable force. The myosin filaments of smooth muscle are also assembled differently, such that their head regions lie symmetrically on either side of a ribbon-like filament, rather than imposing a bipolar organization on the filament. Actin filaments, to which they bind, can thus slide along the whole length of the myosin filament during contraction. In addition, dynamic polymerization of both myosin and actin monomers during activation can alter the length of the contractile filaments. These differences underpin the ability of smooth muscle to undergo much greater changes in length than striated muscle. Actin–myosin filament sliding generates tension, which transmits to focal regions of the plasma membrane, changing the cell to a shorter, more rounded shape (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 6.3B</span></a>) and often deforming the nucleus to a corkscrew-like profile.</div><div class="text" id="p0105">Although some smooth muscles can generate as much force per unit cross-sectional area as skeletal muscle, the force develops much more slowly. Smooth muscle can contract by more than 80%, much greater than the 30% or so to which striated muscle is limited. The significance of this is illustrated by the urinary bladder, which is capable of emptying completely from an internal volume of 300<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>ml or more. Smooth muscles can maintain tension for long periods with very little expenditure of energy. Many smooth muscle structures are able to generate spontaneous contractions, examples are found in the walls of the intestines, ureter and uterine tube.</div></section><section><a id="s0040"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0050">Excitation–contraction coupling in smooth muscle</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0110">Excitation–contraction coupling in smooth muscle is more complex than in skeletal or cardiac muscle, and may be electromechanical or pharmacomechanical. Electromechanical coupling involves depolarization of the cell membrane by an action potential, and may be generated when a membrane receptor, usually linked with an ion channel, is occupied by a neurotransmitter, hormone or other blood-borne substance. It is most commonly seen in unitary and phasic smooth muscles such as those of the viscera, with transmission of electrical excitation from cell to cell via gap junctions. In some types of smooth muscle depolarization may be the consequence of other stimuli, such as cooling, stretch and even light.</div><div class="text" id="p0115">Pharmacomechanical coupling is a receptor-mediated and G-protein coupled process, and is the major mechanism in tonic smooth muscles such as in the vasculature and airways. It may involve several pathways, including formation of inositol trisphosphate, which triggers intracellular calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, activation of voltage-independent calcium channels in the sarcolemma, and depolarization causing activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels (reviewed in <a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Berridge (2008)</a>). Many receptors also couple to kinases that modulate contraction in a calcium-independent fashion, either via myosin phosphatase (see below) or via the actin cytoskeleton (see above). The extent to which any of these pathways contributes to activation varies between different types of smooth muscle.</div><div class="text" id="p0120">Whilst the regulation of contraction of smooth muscle is largely calcium-dependent, the effects of an elevation of intracellular calcium are mediated via myosin, not actin/tropomyosin as in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Most smooth muscles contain little or no troponin, and instead calcium binds to calmodulin. The calcium–calmodulin complex regulates the activity of myosin light chain kinase, which phosphorylates myosin regulatory light chains and initiates the myosin–actin adenosine 5′-triphosphatase (ATPase) cycle. The enzymatic activation process is therefore inherently slow. Myosin phosphatase dephosphorylates myosin and thus promotes relaxation. The degree of myosin phosphorylation and therefore contraction depends on the relative activities of myosin light chain kinase and myosin phosphatase. Thus inhibition of the phosphatase, e.g. by Rho kinase, increases phosphorylation for any level of calcium (i.e. increases calcium sensitivity). The latter is a central component of the response to many constrictor agonists.</div><section><a id="s9050"/><section><a id="s0050"/><h4 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0055">Regulation of smooth muscle intracellular calcium</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0130">Intracellular calcium is a key determinant of smooth muscle function, including contraction and also proliferation, migration and secretion of mediators. Its regulation in smooth muscle is particularly complex, and involves calcium entry via both voltage-dependent and independent ion channels, release from and reuptake into intracellular stores such as the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and modulation by mitochondria.</div><div class="text" id="p0135">The arrangement of peripheral signalling microdomains (see above) is vital to this process. Sequential release from inositol trisphosphate receptors and calcium-sensitive ryanodine receptors (calcium release channels) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, together with reuptake via the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), give rise to slow calcium oscillations; it is now thought that the rate of oscillations, rather than the average level of calcium, is the prime driver for smooth muscle function, including contraction and activation of gene transcription (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Berridge 2008</a>).</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0055"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0060">Origin of smooth muscle</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0140">Smooth muscle cells develop from a range of mesenchymal sources: the muscularis layer of visceral tubular systems, e.g. gut, airways etc. derive from local splanchnopleuric mesenchyme, whereas the smooth muscle of the sphincter and dilator pupillae is derived from neurectoderm. The origin of the tunica media of blood and larger lymphatic vessels varies throughout the body; sources include local splanchnopleuric mesenchyme condensing around endothelial networks and, within and around the vertebrae and muscles of the back and the descending aorta, from local somites (<a href="#bib57" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_57">Wiegreffe et al 2007</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0145">Following a period of proliferation, clusters of myoblasts become elongated in the same orientation. Dense bodies, associated with actin and cytoskeletal filaments, appear in the cytoplasm, and the surface membrane starts to acquire its specialized features, i.e. caveolae, adherens junctions and gap junctions. Cytoskeletal filaments extend to insert into the submembraneous dense plaques and cytoplasmic dense bodies. Thick filaments are seen a few days after the first appearance of thin filaments and intermediate filaments, and from this time the cells are able to contract. During development, dense bodies increase in number and further elements of the cytoskeleton are added. In addition to synthesizing the cytoskeleton and contractile apparatus, the differentiating cells express and secrete components of the extracellular matrix.</div><div class="text" id="p0150">In a developing smooth muscle, all the cells express characteristics of the same stage of differentiation and there are no successive waves of differentiation. From its earliest appearance to maturity, a smooth muscle increases several hundred-fold in mass, partly by a 2–4-fold increase in the size of individual cells, but mainly by a very large increase in cell number. Growth occurs by division of cells in every part of the muscle, not just at its surface or ends. Mitosis occurs in cells in which differentiation is already well advanced, as evidenced by the presence of myofilaments and membrane specializations. Mitotic smooth muscle cells may be found at any stage of life but their numbers peak before birth, at a time that differs for different muscles; they are rare in the adult unless the tissue is stimulated to hypertrophy (as in the pregnant uterus) or to repair. The ability of mature cells to undergo mitosis therefore differs between the three major types of muscle: skeletal muscle cells cannot divide at all after differentiation; cardiac muscle cells can divide but only before birth; and smooth muscle cells appear to remain capable of division throughout life.</div><div class="text" id="p0155">During the early stages of development, smooth muscle expresses embryonic and non-muscle isoforms of myosin. The proportions of these isoforms decrease progressively. Initially, SM-1 is the dominant or exclusive smooth muscle heavy chain isoform and the SM-2 isoform becomes more established later.

Fluid and solutes exchange between the plasma and interstitium across capillaries and small venules. Excess interstitial fluid from peripheral tissues returns to the blood vascular system via the lymphatic system, which also provides a channel for the migration of leukocytes and the absorption of certain nutrients from the gut.</div><div class="text" id="p0180">The cardiovascular system carries nutrients, oxygen, hormones, etc. throughout the body and the blood redistributes and disperses heat. As a consequence of the hydrostatic pressure, the system also has mechanical effects, such as maintaining tissue turgidity. Blood circulates within a system made up of the heart, the central pump and main motor of the system; arteries, which lead away from the heart and carry the blood to the periphery; and veins, which return the blood to the heart. The heart is essentially a pair of muscular pumps, one feeding the pulmonary circulation, which is responsible for gas exchange in the lungs and has a low hydrostatic pressure, and the other feeding the systemic circulation, which has a high hydrostatic pressure and serves the rest of the body. With limited exceptions, both circulations form a closed system of tubes, so that blood <span class="italic">per se</span> does not usually leave the circulation.</div><div class="text" id="p0185">From the centre to the periphery, the vascular tree shows three main modifications. The arteries increase in number by repeated bifurcation and by sending out side branches, in both the systemic and the pulmonary circulation. For example, the aorta, which carries blood from the heart to the systemic circulation, gives rise to about 4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>×10<sup>6</sup> arterioles and four times as many capillaries. The arteries also decrease in diameter, although not to the same extent as their increase in number, so that a hypothetical cross-section of all the vessels will show an increase in total area with increasing distance from the heart. At its emergence from the heart, the aorta of an adult man has an outer diameter of approximately 30<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm (cross-sectional area of nearly 7<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm<sup>2</sup>). The diameter decreases along the arterial tree until it is as little as 10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm in arterioles (each with a cross-sectional area of about 80<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm<sup>2</sup>). However, given the enormous number of arterioles, the total cross-sectional area at this level is approximately 150<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm<sup>2</sup>, more than 200 times that of the aorta. As a result, blood flow is faster near the heart than at the periphery.</div><div class="text" id="p0190">The walls of arteries decrease in thickness towards the periphery, although this is not as substantial as the reduction in vessel diameter. Consequently, in the smallest arteries (arterioles), the thickness of the wall represents about half the outer radius of the vessel, whereas in a large vessel it represents between one-fifteenth and one-fifth, e.g. in the thoracic aorta the radius is approximately 17<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm and the wall thickness 1.1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm.</div><div class="text" id="p0195">Venules, which return blood from the capillaries, converge on each other, forming a progressively smaller number of veins of increasingly large size. As with arteries, the hypothetical total cross-sectional area of all veins at a given level reduces nearer to the heart. Eventually, only the two largest veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae, open into the heart from the systemic circulation. A similar pattern is found in the pulmonary circulation but here the vascular loop is shorter and has fewer branch points, and consequently, the number of vessels is smaller than in the systemic circulation. The total end-to-end length of the vascular network in a typical adult is twice the circumference of the earth.</div><div class="text" id="p0200">Large arteries, such as the thoracic aorta and subclavian, axillary, femoral and popliteal arteries, lie close to a single vein that drains the same territory as that supplied by the artery. Other arteries are usually flanked by two veins, satellite veins (venae comitantes), which lie on either side of the artery and have numerous cross-connections; the whole is enclosed in a single connective tissue sheath. The artery and the two satellite veins are often associated with a nerve, and when they are surrounded by a common connective tissue sheath they form a neurovascular bundle.</div><div class="text" id="p0205">The close association between the larger arteries and veins in the limbs allows counterflow exchange of heat. This mechanism promotes heat transfer from arterial to venous blood and thus helps to preserve body heat. Counterflow heat exchange systems are found in certain organs, e.g. in the testis, where the pampiniform plexus of veins surrounds the testicular artery (this arrangement not only conserves body heat, but also maintains the temperature of the testis below average body temperature). Counterflow exchange mechanisms are found in the microcirculation, as in the vasa recta in the renal medulla. Here, countercurrent exchange retains solutes at a high concentration in the medullary interstitium, with efferent venous blood transferring solutes to the afferent arterial supply; this mechanism is essential for concentration of the urine.</div><div class="text" id="p0210">Arteries and veins are named primarily according to their anatomical position. In functional terms, four main classes of vessel are described: conducting and distributing vessels (large arteries), resistance vessels (small arteries but mainly arterioles), exchange vessels (capillaries, sinusoids and small venules) and capacitance vessels (veins). Structurally, arteries can also be divided into elastic and muscular types. Although muscle cells and elastic tissue are present in all arteries, the relative amount of elastic material is greatest in the largest vessels, whereas the relative amount of smooth muscle increases progressively towards the smallest arteries.</div><div class="text" id="p0215">The large conducting arteries that arise from the heart, together with their main branches, are characterized by the predominantly elastic properties of their walls. Distributing vessels are smaller arteries supplying the individual organs, and their walls are characterized by a well-developed muscular component. Resistance vessels include the smallest arteries and arterioles, and are highly muscularized. They provide the major part of peripheral resistance to blood flow and so cause the largest drop in blood pressure before the blood flows into the tissue capillary beds.</div><div class="text" id="p0220">Capillaries, sinusoids and small (postcapillary) venules are collectively termed exchange vessels. Their thin walls allow exchange between blood and the interstitial fluid that surrounds all cells: this is the essential function of a circulatory system. Arterioles, capillaries and venules constitute the microvasculature, the structural basis of the microcirculation.</div><div class="text" id="p0225">Larger venules and veins form an extensive but variable, large-volume, low-pressure system of vessels conveying blood back to the heart. Their high capacitance is due to the significant distensibility (compliance) of their walls, so that the content of blood is high even at low pressures. Veins contain the greatest proportion of blood, reflecting their large relative volume.</div><div class="text" id="p0230">Blood from the gastrointestinal tract (with the exception of the lower part of the anal canal) and from the spleen, pancreas and gallbladder drains to the liver via the portal vein. The portal vein ramifies within the substance of the liver like an artery and ends in the hepatic sinusoids. These drain into the hepatic veins, which in turn drain into the inferior vena cava. Blood supplying the abdominal organs thus passes through two sets of capillaries before it returns to the heart. The first provides the organs with oxygenated blood, and the second carries deoxygenated blood, rich in absorption products from the intestine, through the liver parenchyma. A venous portal circulation also connects the median eminence and infundibulum of the hypothalamus with the adenohypophysis. In essence, a venous portal system is a capillary network that lies between two veins, instead of between an artery and a vein, which is the more usual arrangement in the circulation. A capillary network may also be interposed between two arteries, e.g. in the renal glomeruli, where the glomerular capillary bed lies between afferent and efferent arterioles. This maintains a relatively high-pressure system, which is important for renal filtration.</div><div class="text" id="p0235">A parallel circulatory system is provided by the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes. Lymphatic vessels originate in peripheral tissues as blind-ended endothelial tubes that collect excess fluid from the interstitial spaces between cells and conduct it as lymph. Lymph is returned to the blood vascular system via lymphatic vessels, which converge on the large veins in the root of the neck.</div><div class="text" id="p0240">Certain pathologies of the cardiovascular and lymphatic systems are described below; for information on vascular tumours, see <a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_44">Sepulveda and Buchanan (2014)</a>.

The intima (tunica intima) is the innermost layer. Its main component, the endothelium, lines the entire vascular tree, including the heart and lymphatic vessels. The media (tunica media) contains muscle cells, elastic fibres and collagen. While it is by far the thickest layer in arteries, the media is absent in capillaries and is comparatively thin in veins. The adventitia (tunica adventitia) is the outer coat of the vessel and consists of connective tissue, nerves and vessel capillaries (vasa vasorum). It links the vessels to the surrounding tissues. Vessels differ in the relative thicknesses and detailed compositions of these layers.<a id="pg132"/></div><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="132" id="pagebreak_132"/></div></section><section><a id="s0080"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0085">Large elastic arteries</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0250">The aorta and its largest branches (brachiocephalic, common carotid, subclavian and common iliac arteries) are large elastic arteries that conduct blood to the medium-sized distributing arteries.</div><div class="text" id="p0255">The intima is made of an endothelium, resting on a basal lamina, and a subendothelial connective tissue layer. The endothelial cells are flat, elongated and polygonal in outline, with their long axes parallel to the direction of blood flow (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 6.17</a>). The subendothelial layer is well developed, contains elastic fibres and type I collagen fibrils, fibroblasts and small, smooth muscle-like myointimal cells. The latter accumulate lipid with age, and in an extreme form this contributes to atherosclerosis (see below). Thickening of the intima progresses with age and is more marked in the distal than in the proximal segment of the aorta.</div><div class="text" id="p0260">A prominent internal elastic lamina, sometimes split, lies between intima and media.

Elastic arteries can thus sustain continuous blood flow despite the pulsatile cardiac output, and smooth out the cyclical pressure wave. The media has a markedly layered structure, in which fenestrated layers of elastin (elastic lamellae) alternate with interlamellar smooth muscle cells (<a href="#f0045"><span class="bold">Fig. 6.6</span></a>), collagen and fine elastic fibres. The arrangement is very regular, such that each elastic lamella and adjacent interlamellar zone is regarded as a ‘lamellar unit’ of the media.

The internal elastic lamina (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 6.7</a>; <a href="#f0035"><span class="bold">Fig. 6.8</span></a>) is a distinct, thin layer, sometimes duplicated and occasionally absent. It is thrown into wavy folds as a result of contraction of smooth muscle in the media. Some 75% of the mass of the media consists of smooth muscle cells that run spirally or circumferentially around the vessel wall. The relative amount of extracellular matrix is therefore less than in large arteries, although fine elastic fibres that run mainly parallel to the muscle cells are present. An external elastic lamina, composed of sheets of elastic fibres, forms a less compact layer than the internal lamina, and separates the media from the adventitia in larger muscular arteries.

The nuclei are elongated and orientated parallel to the vessel length, as is the long axis of the cell. The basal surface of the endothelium contacts a basal lamina, but an internal elastic lamina is either absent or highly fenestrated and traversed by cytoplasmic processes of muscle or endothelial cells. The muscle cells are larger in cytoplasmic volume than those in the walls of large arteries and form a layer one or two cells thick. They are arranged circumferentially and are tightly wound around the endothelium. In the smallest arterioles each cell makes several turns, producing extensive apposition between parts of the same cell. Contraction of the muscle constricts the lumen, and so controls blood flow into the capillary bed; arterioles thus act functionally as precapillary sphincters, even though the absence of an anatomically delineated sphincter means that the term is no longer commonly used.

This distinction is important because postcapillary venules, which lack muscle in their walls, are as permeable to solutes as capillaries and are thus part of the microcirculatory bed. The cross-sectional area of the vascular tree is at its maximum at the level of the postcapillary venule, and there is a dramatic fall in pressure (from 25<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mmHg in the capillary to approximately 5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mmHg). Muscular venules converge to produce a series of veins of progressively larger diameter. Venules and veins are capacitance vessels because they have thin distensible walls that can hold a large volume of blood and accommodate luminal pressure changes.</div><section><a id="s0110"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0115">Fluid exchange in the microvasculature</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0325">The microvasculature is important for the creation and maintenance of the interstitial fluid that bathes the cells. The thin walls of capillaries and small venules allow easy diffusion of fluid and most small molecules, but the endothelial barrier prevents movement of proteins; consequently, plasma and interstitial fluid have almost identical compositions, except that the latter contains very little protein. Fluid transfer across these exchange vessels is driven by the balance between the hydrostatic pressure (i.e. blood pressure within them) forcing fluid into the tissues, and the oncotic pressure (colloidal osmotic pressure, reflecting the difference in protein concentrations) drawing fluid back into the vessels. These ‘Starling forces’ are normally closely balanced, so differences in hydrostatic pressure mean that fluid tends to be filtered into the tissue at the arterial side of the exchange vessels and largely reabsorbed at the venous side. The balance forms lymph. Disruption of the balance (e.g. high venous pressure in the feet) can lead to accumulation of tissue fluid (oedema) and swelling.</div></section><section><a id="s0115"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0120">Inflammation and endothelial permeability</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0330">Inflammatory mediators increase the permeability of capillaries and small venules by causing contraction of endothelial cells and so loosening tight junctions. This facilitates leukocyte extravasation by diapedesis but also disrupts normal barrier function, allowing extravasation of protein and fluids. The consequence is tissue oedema and the swelling that is commonly associated with inflammation. There is considerable cross-talk between endothelial cells and cells of the immune system.</div></section><section><a id="s0120"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0125">Veins</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0335">Veins are characterized by relatively thin walls in comparison to arteries of similar size and by a large capacitance. Wall thickness is not correlated exactly with the size of the vein and varies in different regions, e.g. the wall is thicker in veins of the leg than it is in veins of a similar size in the arm.</div><div class="text" id="p0340">The structural plan of the wall is similar to that of other vessels, except that the amount of muscle is considerably less than in arteries, while collagen and, in some veins, elastic fibres, predominate. In most veins, e.g. those of the limbs, the muscle is arranged approximately circularly. Longitudinal muscle is present in the iliac, brachiocephalic, portal and renal veins and in the superior and inferior venae cavae. Muscle is absent in the maternal placental veins, dural venous sinuses, pial and retinal veins, veins of trabecular bone and the venous spaces of erectile tissue: these veins consist of endothelium supported by variable amounts of connective tissue. Distinction between the media and adventitial layers is often difficult, and a discrete internal elastic lamina is absent.</div><div class="text" id="p0345">Tethering of some veins to connective tissue fasciae and other surrounding tissues may prevent collapse of the vessel even under negative pressure (e.g. in the cranium). Pressure within the venous system does not normally exceed 5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mmHg, and it decreases as the veins grow larger and fewer in number, approaching zero close to the heart. As they contain only a small amount of muscle and commonly have a large calibre, veins have limited influence on blood flow. However, venoconstriction is an important component of the baroreceptor reflex because it reduces vein compliance and therefore capacity, effectively mobilizing blood to maintain or increase central venous pressure, and hence cardiac output. A sudden fall in blood volume, e.g. following a haemorrhage, also initiates the elastic recoil and reflex constriction of veins, in order to compensate for the blood loss and maintain central venous pressure and venous return to the heart. Vasoconstriction in cutaneous veins in response to cooling is important in thermoregulation.</div><div class="text" id="p0350">Most veins have valves to prevent reflux of blood (<a href="#f0080"><span class="bold">Figs 6.13</span></a>–<a href="#f0085"><span class="bold">6.14</span></a>). A valve is formed by an inward projection of the intima, strengthened <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="135" id="pagebreak_135"/><a id="pg135"/>by collagen and elastic fibres, and covered by endothelium that differs in orientation on its two surfaces. Surfaces facing the vessel wall have transversely arranged endothelial cells, whereas on the luminal surface of the valve, over which the main stream of blood flows, cells are arranged longitudinally in the direction of flow. Most commonly two, or occasionally three, valves lie opposite one another; sometimes only one is present. They are found in small veins or where tributaries join larger veins. The valves are semilunar (cusps) and attached by their convex edges to the venous wall. Their concave margins are directed with the flow and lie against the wall as long as flow is towards the heart. When blood flow reverses, the valves close and blood fills an expanded region of the wall, a sinus, on the cardiac side of the closed valve. This may give a ‘knotted’ (varicose) appearance to the distended veins, if these have many valves. In the limbs, especially the legs where venous return is against gravity, valves are of great importance in aiding venous flow. Blood is moved towards the heart by the intermittent pressure produced by contractions of the surrounding muscles (the muscle pump). Valves are absent in the veins of the thorax and abdomen.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0080"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000069/main.assets/f06-13-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0070"/><a id="fspara0070"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 6.13</span> The upper portions of the femoral and long saphenous veins laid open to show the valves, at about two-thirds of their natural size.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0085"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000069/main.assets/f06-14-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0075"/><a id="fspara0075"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 6.14</span> A valve in a human small vein, formed from flap-like extensions of the intima that close when pressure increases on the proximal side, preventing backflow. <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Mr Peter Helliwell and the late Dr Joseph Mathew, Department of Histopathology, Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, UK.</span></figcaption></figure></div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0125"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0130">Vascular shunts and anastomoses</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0135">Arteriovenous shunts and anastomoses</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0130"/><div class="textfl" id="p0355">Communications between the arterial and venous systems are found in many regions of the body.

These have similarities to both capillaries and the smallest arterioles, and have a discontinuous layer of smooth muscle in their walls. Metarterioles can deliver blood directly to venules or to a capillary bed, according to local demand and conditions. When functional demand is low, blood flow is largely limited to the bypass channel. Periodic opening and closing of different arterioles irrigates different parts of the capillary network.

Connecting vessels may be straight or coiled, and often possess a thick muscular tunic. Under sympathetic control, the vessel is able to close completely, diverting blood into the capillary bed. When patent, the vessel carries blood from artery to vein, partially or completely excluding the capillary bed from the circulation. Simple arteriovenous anastomoses are widespread and occur notably in the skin of the nose, lips and ears, nasal and gastrointestinal mucosae, erectile tissue, tongue, thyroid gland and sympathetic ganglia. There are few arteriovenous anastomoses in the neonate, but they develop rapidly during the early years. In old age they atrophy, sclerose and diminish in number.

Each glomus organ has one or more afferent arteries, stemming from branches of cutaneous arteries that approach the surface.

Anastomosis by convergence occurs when two arteries converge and merge, as happens when the vertebral arteries form the basilar artery at the base of the brain.

Anastomoses between adjacent angiosomes may occur within the skin or within muscle. Some muscles are supplied by a single artery and its accompanying veins and therefore lie within one angiosome, while other muscles are supplied by more than one vessel and therefore cross more than one angiosome.

Endothelial cells are in contact with the blood stream and thus influence blood flow. They regulate the diffusion of substances and migration of cells out of and into the circulating blood. In the brain, endothelial cells of small vessels actively transport substances, e.g. glucose, into the brain parenchyma. Endothelial cells play an important role in haemostasis because they produce von Willebrand factor, which promotes platelet adhesion (see below); secrete prostacyclin and thrombomodulin, which limits clot formation; and promote fibrinolysis by secreting tissue plasminogen activator. They have selective phagocytic activity and are able to extract substances from the blood. For example, the endothelium of pulmonary vessels removes and inactivates several polypeptides, biogenic amines, bradykinin, prostaglandins and lipids from the circulation, and converts the precursor of angiotensin II to its active form.</div><div class="text" id="p0400">Endothelial cells secrete vasoconstrictor (thromboxane) and vasodilator (prostacyclin) prostaglandins, nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin (a vasoconstrictor). They respond to stretch (e.g. increased pressure) and the shear effect of blood flow via stretch-sensitive ion channels in the cell membrane. Endothelial cells synthesize components of the basal lamina. They proliferate to provide new cells during growth of blood vessels, to replace damaged endothelium, and to provide solid cords of cells that develop into new blood vessels (angiogenesis). Angiogenesis, which may be stimulated by local production of autocrine growth factors in response to tissue hypoxia, is important in wound healing and in the growth of tumours. Endothelial cells are also active participants in, and regulators of, inflammatory processes (<a href="#bib37" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_37">Pober and Sessa 2007</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0405">Although endothelial cells are thin, they extend over a relatively large surface area.

They adhere to adjacent cells through the junctional complex, an area of apposition where adherent and tight junctions are found. They also communicate via gap junctions, which are most marked in continuous capillaries. Cell contacts and myoendothelial gap junctions between endothelial and smooth muscle cells are common in small resistance arteries and arterioles, where the separation between endothelium and media is reduced and the inner elastic lamina is either very thin or absent.

Selectins and integrins are expressed on leukocytes and mediate adhesion of circulating cells to the endothelium, which expresses selectins and members of the immunoglobulin supergene family. Regulated expression of these molecules by both cell types provides the means by which leukocytes recognize the vessel wall (leukocyte homing antigens and vascular addressins), adhere to it and subsequently leave the circulation.</div><div class="text" id="p0460">The first step in this cascade is the loose binding or tethering of leukocytes, and this is initiated via L-, P- or E-selectin. This weak, reversible adhesion allows leukocytes to roll along the endothelial surface of a vessel lumen at low velocity, making and breaking contact, and sampling the endothelial cell surfaces. Recognition of chemokines (chemotactic signalling molecules) presented by the endothelium leads to ‘inside-out’ signalling and conversion of integrins at the leukocyte surface into actively adhesive configurations that bind strongly to their endothelial ligands, resulting in stable arrest. Finally, the leukocyte migrates through the vessel wall (diapedesis), passing either between (paracellular migration) or across (transcellular migration) endothelial cells. Transcellular migration is thought to be the preferred pathway; endothelial transcytotic vesicles (caveolae), intermediate filaments (vimentin) and F-actin are important in the creation of transient transcellular channels through which leukocytes pass. They then cross the basal lamina and migrate into the surrounding tissue by mechanisms that involve CD31 antigen and matrix metalloproteinases (reviewed in <a href="#bib53" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_53">Vestweber (2007)</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0170"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0175">Cell adhesion molecules</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0475">There are three known members of the selectin family of adhesive proteins: L-selectin (also known as lymphocyte homing receptor), E-selectin and P-selectin. L-selectin is expressed on most leukocytes. Endothelial cells of HEVs in lymphoid organs express its oligosaccharide ligand, although other molecules such as mucins may be alternative ligands. L-selectin mediates homing of lymphocytes, especially to peripheral lymph nodes, but also promotes the accumulation of neutrophils and monocytes at sites of inflammation. E-selectin is an inducible adhesion molecule that mediates adhesion of leukocytes to inflammatory cytokine-activated endothelium, and is only transiently expressed on endothelium. P-selectin is rapidly mobilized from Wiebel–Palade bodies, where it is stored, to the endothelial surface after endothelial activation. It binds to ligands expressed on neutrophils, platelets and monocytes, and, like E-selectin, tethers leukocytes to endothelium at sites of inflammation. P-selectin is quickly endocytosed by the endothelial cells and so its expression is short-lived.</div><div class="text" id="p0480">The integrins are a large family of molecules that mediate cell-to-cell adhesion as well as interactions of cells with extracellular matrix. Certain β<sub>1</sub> integrin heterodimers are expressed on lymphocytes 2–4 weeks after antigenic stimulation (very late antigens, VLAs) and bind to the extracellular matrix. Additionally, VLA-4, present on resting lymphocytes (expression increases after activation), monocytes and eosinophils, binds to the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), the ligand on activated endothelium. In contrast to β<sub>1</sub> integrins, which many cells express, the expression of β<sub>2</sub> integrins is limited to white blood cells. Although the leukocyte integrins are not constitutively adhesive, they become highly adhesive after cell activation and therefore play a key role in the events required for cell migration. The endothelial ligands for one such β<sub>2</sub> integrin are the intercellular adhesion molecules-1 and 2 (ICAM-1 and ICAM-2), which belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily.</div><div class="text" id="p0485">Three members of the large immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins are involved in leukocyte–endothelial adhesion, providing integrin counter-receptors on the endothelial cell membrane.

A thinner layer of smooth muscle is also found in venules and veins; small segments of the pulmonary veins nearest to the heart contain striated cardiac muscle. Contraction of the smooth muscle in arteries and arterioles reduces the calibre of the vessel lumen, reducing blood flow through the vessel. This is particularly effective in small resistance vessels, where the wall is thick relative to the diameter of the vessel. Smooth muscle activation also increases the rigidity of the vessel wall, reducing its compliance. In arteries this affects propagation of the pulse, whereas in veins it effectively reduces their capacity.</div><div class="text" id="p0505">The smooth muscle cells synthesize and secrete elastin, collagen and other extracellular components of the media, which bear directly on the mechanical properties of the vessels.

In arterioles and veins, smooth muscle cells more closely resemble those from the viscera. The cells are packed with myofilaments and other elements of the cytoskeleton, including intermediate filaments. Vascular muscle cells contain intermediate filaments of either vimentin alone or both vimentin and desmin, whereas the intermediate filaments of visceral smooth muscle are exclusively of desmin. Intercellular junctions are mainly of the adhesive (adherens) type, coupling cells mechanically.

More extensive fusion produces lamellae of elastic material, which, though usually perforated and thus incomplete, separate the layers of muscle cells. The internal elastic lamina is a conspicuous elastic lamella in arteries, between intima and media, which allows the vessel to recoil after distension. When the intraluminal pressure falls below physiological limits (post mortem), it is compressed and coils up into a regular corrugated shape (<a href="#f0105"><span class="bold">Fig. 6.20</span></a>; see <a href="#f0050">Figs 6.7</a>, <a href="#f0060">6.10</a>), reducing but not obliterating the lumen; the profile of the artery remains circular. Fenestrations in the elastic lamina, which may also be split in thickness, allow materials to diffuse between intima and media. An outer elastic lamina, similar in appearance to, but markedly less well developed and less compact than, the internal elastic lamina, lies at the outer aspect of the media at its boundary with the adventitia (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 6.7</a>).

Type III collagen (reticulin) occupies much of the interstitial space between the muscle cells of the media and is also found in the intima. Collagen is abundant in the adventitia, where type I collagen fibres form large bundles that increase in size from the junction with the media to the outer limit of the vessel wall. In veins, collagen is the main component of the vessel wall and accounts for more than half its mass.</div><div class="text" id="p0535">In general, collagen and elastic fibres in the media run parallel to, or at a small angle to, the axes of the muscle cells, and they are therefore arranged mainly circumferentially. In contrast, the predominant arrangement of collagen fibres in the adventitia is longitudinal. This arrangement imposes constraints on length change in large vessels under pressure, e.g. in large arteries, in which the radial distension under the effect of the pulse far exceeds the longitudinal distension. The outer sheath of type I collagen in the adventitia therefore has a structurally supportive role. The more delicate type III collagen network of the media provides attachment to the muscle cells and its role is to transmit force around the circumference of the vessel. In a distended vessel, the elastic fibres store energy and, by recoiling, help to restore the resting length and calibre.</div><div class="text" id="p0540">The extracellular material of the media, including collagen and elastin, is produced by the muscle cells. Its turnover is slow compared to that in other tissues. In the adventitia, collagen is synthesized and secreted by fibroblasts, as it is in other connective tissues. During postnatal development, while vessels are increasing in diameter and wall thickness, there is a concomitant increase in elastin and collagen content. Subsequent changes in vessel structure, seen during ageing, include an increase in the ratio of collagen to elastin, with a reduction in vessel elasticity.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0195"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0200">Adventitia</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0545">The adventitia is formed of general connective tissue: the thickness and density of its collagen fibre bundles vary.</div><section><a id="s0200"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0205">Vasa vasorum</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0550">In smaller vessels, the nourishment of the tissues of the vessel wall is provided by diffusion from the blood circulating in the vessel itself.

Nerves are occasionally found within the outermost layers of the media in some of the large muscular arteries.</div><div class="text" id="p0560">Nervi vasorum are small bundles of axons which are almost invariably unmyelinated and typically varicose. Most are postganglionic axons derived from neurones in sympathetic ganglia. The density of innervation varies in different vessels and in different areas of the body; it is usually sparser in veins and larger lymphatic vessels, whereas large veins with a pronounced muscle layer, such as the hepatic portal vein, are well innervated. Some vessels in the brain may be innervated by intrinsic cerebral neurones, although neural control of brain vessels is of minor importance compared with metabolic and autoregulation (local response to stretch stimuli).</div><div class="text" id="p0565">The control of vascular smooth muscle is complex. Vasoconstrictor adrenergic fibres release noradrenaline (norepinephrine), which acts on α-adrenergic receptors in the muscle cell membrane. In addition, circulating hormones and factors such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins and endothelin, which are released from endothelial cells, exert a powerful effect on the muscle cells. Neurotransmitters reach the muscle from the adventitial surface of the media, whereas hormonal and endothelial factors diffuse from the intimal surface. In a few tissues, sympathetic cholinergic fibres inhibit smooth muscle contraction and induce vasodilation. Vascular smooth muscle exhibits endogenous (myogenic) activity in response to stretch and shear.</div><div class="text" id="p0570">Most arteries are accompanied by nerves that travel in parallel with them to the peripheral organs that they supply: these paravascular nerves do not innervate the vessels they accompany.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0210"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0215">Pericytes</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0575">Pericytes are present at the outer surface of capillaries and the smallest venules (postcapillary venules), where an adventitia is absent and there are no muscle cells.

All cerebral vessels except capillaries have a thin outer coating of meningeal cells, usually one layer thick, with adjacent meningeal cells joined by desmosomes and gap junctions. Cerebral capillaries, the site of the blood–brain barrier, are lined by endothelial cells joined by particularly tight junctions. The endothelial cytoplasm contains a few pinocytotic vesicles. The cells are surrounded by a basal lamina (see <a href="../B9780702077050000033/B9780702077050000033.xhtml#f0075">Fig. 3.14</a>); at points of contact with perivascular astrocytes, the intervening basal lamina is formed by fusion of the endothelial and glial basal laminae.

Hypoxia produces hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), when small pulmonary arteries constrict rather than dilate (as occurs in the systemic vasculature). This mechanism diverts blood away from poorly ventilated areas of the lung, and so optimizes ventilation/perfusion matching (<a href="#bib50" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_50">Sylvester et al 2012</a>). However, in hypoxic lung disease or at altitude, this can lead to pulmonary hypertension; if sustained, this can lead to extensive vascular remodelling, and eventually to right heart failure.

The renal vasculature exhibits a high degree of autoregulation. Afferent arterioles leading to the glomerular capillaries in Bowman’s capsule have a fenestrated endothelium (and thus a high permeability) and a specialized basement membrane, and are covered by podocytes (modified epithelial cells). The basement membrane and podocyte processes form the ultrafiltration membrane (see <a href="../B9780702077050000720/B9780702077050000720.xhtml#f0060">Figs 72.15</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000720/B9780702077050000720.xhtml#f0075">72.18</a>). The capillaries are surrounded by phagocytic mesangial cells. Glomerular capillary pressure is higher than elsewhere, and is regulated via differential constriction of the afferent and efferent arterioles. The efferent arterioles lead to peritubular capillaries which surround the cortical nephron, and to the vasa recta which descend deep into the medulla. The vasa recta help to maintain the medullary osmotic gradient essential for concentration of urine. Decreased pressure and/or stimulation by the sympathetic nerves innervating the afferent arterioles causes release of renin from granular cells in the endothelium: renin then activates the precursor of angiotensin 2, an important hormone for regulation of blood pressure and volume. Renal artery obstruction, e.g. in atherosclerosis, can cause hypertension; essential hypertension may also originate in renal dysfunction, and renal sympathetic nerve ablation has been promoted as a treatment for resistant hypertension (<a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Papademetriou et al 2014</a>).

Within the intima a small proportion of the LDL undergoes oxidative change. The oxidized LDL acts as an inflammatory stimulus, which invokes adhesion molecule expression by endothelial cells, monocyte migration, and cytokine production. Once oxidized, the LDL is taken up by macrophage scavenger receptors, and lipid uptake continues until the cytoplasm is packed with lipid to form macrophage-derived foam cells. This influx of lipid into macrophages results in infiltration of the vessel wall by T lymphocytes, with smooth muscle proliferation, and deposition of collagen and elastin in the intima, extending into the media. The earliest visible lesion is the fatty streak which consists of raised intimal areas full of lipid-filled foam cells (macrophages) and features of inflammation (<a href="#f0120"><span class="bold">Fig. 6.23</span></a>). As these intimal lesions develop, they acquire combinations of extracellular lipid, intracellular lipid within foam cells, and collagen and other connective tissue matrix components produced by smooth muscle cells.

It differs from atherosclerosis as there is no intimal lipid deposition with resultant inflammation; it can affect both arteries and arterioles. Arteriosclerosis is due to gradual replacement of smooth muscle cells by collagen and deposition of plasma proteins in the smooth muscle to produce hyaline change. This process is accelerated by age, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Arteriosclerosis lowers the compliance of the arterial tree and contributes to the age-related increase in systolic blood pressure. The lack of vascular compliance greatly increases susceptibility to hypotension which accounts for the increased mortality of shock in elderly and hypertensive patients. The term ‘intimal hyperplasia’ is used to describe the intimal thickening associated with arteriosclerosis, in which smooth muscle cells, collagen and elastic fibres infiltrate the intima (<a href="#f0130"><span class="bold">Fig. 6.25</span></a>).

It is often due to obesity combined with immobility and is common after surgical operations or long haul flights. Leg or pelvic vein thrombosis is the principal cause of pulmonary thromboembolism. Thrombosis starts at the valves of the deep calf veins, causing deep vein thrombosis. It may propagate into the posterior tibial, popliteal, femoral, or iliac veins and into the inferior vena cava. The outcomes of venous thrombosis include: massive pulmonary embolism and sudden death; asymptomatic pulmonary embolism; pulmonary infarction; pulmonary hypertension. Sudden death is seen with total occlusion of the right side of the heart, and/or one or both left and right pulmonary arteries (<a href="#f0135"><span class="bold">Fig. 6.26</span></a>).

Standing, obesity, old age, cardiac failure and pregnancy predispose to varicose leg veins, which are very common. Although thrombosis occurs in varicose veins, the thrombi do not usually lead to embolization because they adhere to the vein wall. Varicose veins may lead to bleeding and infection, but the usual complication is poor wound healing with venous ulceration, a cause of widespread morbidity in elderly people. Oesophageal varices complicate portal hypertension in cirrhosis of the liver (usually alcohol-related): bleeding from ruptured oesophageal varices is often the terminal event in such patients. Haemorrhoids (piles) are caused by venous hypertension in the pelvic and abdominal veins as a result of constipation, obesity and pregnancy.

They begin as dilated, blind-ended tubes with larger diameters and less regular cross-sectional appearances than those of blood capillaries. Their basal laminae are incomplete or absent and they lack associated pericytes. The smaller lymphatic vessels are lined by endothelial cells, which have numerous transcytotic vesicles within their cytoplasm and so resemble blood capillaries. However, unlike capillaries, their endothelium is generally quite permeable to much larger molecules: they are readily permeable to large colloidal proteins and particulate material such as cell debris and microorganisms, and also to cells. Permeability is facilitated by gaps between the endothelial cells, which lack tight junctions (discontinuous endothelium), and by pinocytosis. The lymphatic system provides an important transport pathway for leukocytes and defence against infection (reviewed in <a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">Saharinen et al (2004)</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0710">Lymph is formed from interstitial fluid, which is derived from blood plasma via filtration in the microcirculation. Much of the filtered fluid is reabsorbed by the time the blood leaves the venules, but about 15% or 8 litres per day enters the lymphatics. Lymphatic vessels take up this residual fluid by passive diffusion and the transient negative pressures in their lumina, that are generated intrinsically by contractile activity of smooth muscle in the largest lymphatic vessel walls, and extrinsically by compression of the lymph vessels as a result of contraction of adjacent muscle or arterial pulsation. The unidirectional flow of lymph is maintained by the presence of valves in the larger vessels (<a href="#f0140"><span class="bold">Fig. 6.27</span></a>). Lymphatic capillaries are prevented from collapsing by anchoring filaments, which tether their walls to surrounding connective tissue structures and exert radial traction.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0140"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000069/main.assets/f06-22-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0140"/><a id="fspara0140"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 6.27</span> A valve (V) in a lymphatic vessel (L), accompanying a small venule (Ven) and arteriole (A) in human connective tissue. <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Mr Peter Helliwell and the late Dr Joseph Mathew, Department of Histopathology, Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, UK.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0715">In most tissues, lymph is clear and colourless; in the lymphatic capillaries it has an identical composition to interstitial fluid.

The terminal lymphatic vessels in the mucosa of the small intestine are known as lacteals and the lymph as chyle. Lymphatic capillaries are not ubiquitous: they are not present in cornea, cartilage, thymus, the central or peripheral nervous systems or bone marrow, and there are very few in the endomysium of skeletal muscles.</div><div class="text" id="p0720">Lymphatic capillaries join into larger vessels that pass to local lymph nodes. Typically, lymph percolates through a series of nodes before reaching a major collecting duct. There are exceptions to this arrangement: the lymph vessels of the thyroid gland and oesophagus, and of the coronary and triangular ligaments of the liver, all drain directly to the thoracic duct without passing through lymph nodes. In the larger vessels, a thin external connective tissue coat supports the endothelium. The largest lymphatic vessels (200<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm) have three layers, like small veins, although their lumen is considerably larger than that of veins with a similar wall thickness. The tunica media contains smooth muscle cells, mostly arranged circumferentially. Elastic fibres are sparse in the tunica intima, but form an external elastic lamina in the tunica adventitia.</div><div class="text" id="p0725">The larger lymphatic vessels differ from small veins in having many more valves (see <a href="#f0140">Fig. 6.27</a>). The valves are semilunar, generally paired and composed of an extension of the intima. Their edges point in the direction of the current, and the vessel wall downstream is expanded into a sinus, which gives the vessels a beaded appearance when they are distended. Valves are important in preventing the backflow of lymph.</div><div class="text" id="p0730">Deep lymphatic vessels usually accompany arteries or veins, and almost all reach either the thoracic duct or the right lymphatic duct, which usually joins the left or right brachiocephalic veins respectively at the root of the neck.</div><div class="text" id="p0735">The thoracic duct is structurally similar to a medium-sized vein but the smooth muscle in its tunica media is more prominent. Most lymphatic vessels anastomose freely. Larger vessels have their own plexiform vasa vasorum and accompanying nerve fibres.

In the developed world, secondary lymphoedema is most commonly the consequence of treatment for cancer, particularly breast cancer, following either surgical removal of lymph nodes and vessels, or their damage by radiation therapy. Tumours can themselves cause lymphoedema if they compress and block lymph vessels. Lymphangiectasia refers to a pathological dilation of lymph vessels, often caused by lymphatic obstruction; both can be primary or acquired. Acute lymphangitis is usually caused by invasion by virulent bacteria, e.g. <span class="italic">Streptococcus pyogenes</span>, causing subcutaneous red streaks draining an infected area: it leads to lymphadenitis and may herald septicaemia.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0270"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0275">Cardiac Muscle</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0750">In cardiac muscle, as in skeletal muscle, the contractile proteins are organized structurally into sarcomeres that are aligned in register across the fibres, producing fine cross-striations that are visible in the light microscope.

The molecular basis for contraction, but not its regulation, is the same. Elevation of cytosolic calcium triggers contraction, corresponding to cardiac systole and the pumping phase of the heart cycle.

Coarser connective tissue, equivalent to the perimysium of skeletal muscle, separates the larger bundles of muscle fibres, and is particularly well developed near the condensations of dense fibrous connective tissue that form the ‘skeleton’ of the heart. The ventricles of the heart are composed of spiralling layers of fibres that run in different directions.

The myofibrils are also less well delineated in cardiac muscle; in transverse sections they often fuse into a continuous array of myofilaments, irregularly bounded by mitochondria and longitudinal elements of sarcoplasmic reticulum. The large mitochondria, with their closely spaced cristae, reflect the highly developed oxidative metabolism of cardiac tissue. The proportion of the cell volume occupied by mitochondria (approximately 35%) is even greater in cardiac muscle than it is in slow twitch skeletal muscle fibres. The high demand for oxygen is also reflected in high levels of myoglobin and an exceptionally rich network of capillaries around the fibres.</div><div class="text" id="p0775">The force of contraction is transferred through the ends of the cardiac muscle cells via the junctional strength provided by the intercalated discs. As in skeletal muscle, force is also transmitted laterally to the sarcolemma and extracellular matrix via vinculin-containing elements that bridge between the Z-discs of peripheral myofibrils and the plasma membrane. The actin-binding proteins spectrin and dystrophin, important components of the cardiac muscle cell cytoskeleton, associate independently with the sarcolemma to provide mechanical support. Both protein complexes form components of the costamere (<a href="#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_41">Samarel 2005</a>, <a href="#bib35" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_35">Peter et al 2011</a>), which, in addition to transmitting force from sarcomeres to the sarcolemma and extracellular matrix, is central to mechanically generated signalling mechanisms.</div><div class="text" id="p0780">Atrial muscle cells are smaller than ventricular cells. The cytoplasm near the Golgi complexes at the poles of the nuclei exhibits dense membrane-bound granules that contain the precursor of atrial natriuretic peptide. This hormone promotes loss of sodium and water in the kidneys, reducing blood volume and thereby lowering blood pressure. It is released into the blood in response to stretch of the atrial wall. Atrial natriuretic peptide and aldosterone have antagonistic effects on renal sodium and water handling, via independent mechanisms.</div><div class="text" id="p0785">The sarcolemma of ventricular cardiac muscle cells invaginates to form T-tubules with a wider lumen than those of skeletal muscle; atrial muscle cells have few or no T-tubules. Unlike skeletal muscle, most T-tubules penetrate the sarcoplasm at the level of the Z-discs (see <a href="#f0150">Fig. 6.29</a>). The T-tubules are interconnected at intervals by longitudinal branches to form a complex network. They serve a similar function in skeletal and cardiac muscle, i.e. to carry the wave of depolarization into the cores of the cells.</div><div class="text" id="p0790">The sarcoplasmic reticulum is a membrane-bound tubular plexus that surrounds and defines, sometimes incompletely, the outlines of individual myofibrils. Its main role, as in skeletal muscle, is the storage, release and re-accumulation (sequestration) of calcium ions. The calcium-binding protein calsequestrin allows large amounts of calcium to be stored within the sarcoplasmic reticulum and modulates activity of the calcium release channels (ryanodine receptors) (<a href="#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_24">Györke and Terentyev 2008</a>). The sarcoplasmic reticulum is separated from the T-tubules by a 15 nm gap spanned by structures termed junctional processes, which are thought to be the cytoplasmic part of the calcium release channels; similar processes are found in skeletal muscle at the junctional surface of the terminal cisternae. Sarcoplasmic reticulum bearing junctional processes is termed junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum to distinguish it from free sarcoplasmic reticulum, which forms a longitudinal network. Junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum makes contact with both the T-tubules and the sarcolemma (of which the T-tubules are an extension). Sarcoplasmic reticulum forms small globular extensions (corbular sarcoplasmic reticulum) in the vicinity of the Z-discs, but not in immediate relation to T-tubules or the sarcolemma. Since the junctions between T-tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum usually involve only one structure of each type, the corresponding profiles in electron micrographs are referred to as dyads, rather than triads as in skeletal muscle.</div><section><a id="s0280"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0285">Intercalated discs</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0795">Intercalated discs are unique, complex junctions between cardiac myocytes.

The transverse portions occur wherever myofibrils abut the end of the cell, and each takes the place of the last Z-disc. At this point, the actin filaments of the terminal sarcomere insert into a dense subsarcolemmal matrix that anchors them, together with other cytoplasmic elements such as intermediate filaments, to the plasma membrane. Prominent desmosomes, often with a dense line in the intercellular space, occur at intervals along each transverse portion. This junctional region is homologous with, and probably similar in composition to, the structure found on the cytoplasmic face of the myotendinous junction, and is a type of fascia adherens junction.

The lateral portions contain gap junctions between adjacent cells (see <a href="#f0160">Fig. 6.31</a>), which provide electrical coupling and so enable the electrical impulse to propagate from one cell to the next, spreading excitation and contraction rapidly along the branching tracts of interconnected cells.

Cardiac muscle cells contain glycogen, which is a reserve during peaks of activity, but the majority of their energy requirement is continuous and supplied only through a highly developed oxidative metabolism, as is evident from the high proportion of the cell volume that is occupied by mitochondria. This metabolism has to be supported by a rich blood supply. Myocardium has a very high perfusion rate of 0.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span> ml/min/g of tissue (5 times that of liver and 15 times that of resting skeletal muscle).

Cardiac muscle is supplied by the coronary vessels. Although there is some variation in the detailed distribution of the arterial branches, the left ventricle, which has the highest workload and largest mass, receives the highest arterial blood flow. Branches run in the myocardium along the coarser aggregations of connective tissue and ramify extensively in the endomysial layer, creating a rich plexus of anastomosing vessels. This plexus includes lymphatic as well as blood capillaries, which is not the case in skeletal muscle.</div><div class="text" id="p0855">The high oxygen requirement of the myocardium makes it vulnerable to ischaemic damage arising from atheroma or embolism in the coronary arteries. This vulnerability is exacerbated in the left ventricle because embedded coronary arteries are compressed by contraction of the myocardium, limiting perfusion during systole. Arterial anastomoses, often more than 100<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm in diameter, are found throughout the heart and are an important factor in determining whether an adequate collateral circulation may develop after a coronary occlusion.</div></section><section><a id="s0305"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0310">Innervation</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0860">Although the impulse-generating and conducting system of the heart establishes an endogenous rhythm, the rate and force of contraction are under neural influence. Both divisions of the autonomic nervous system supply unmyelinated postganglionic fibres to the heart. The innervation is derived bilaterally but it is functionally asymmetric. Activation of the left stellate ganglion (sympathetic) has little effect on heart rate but <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="143" id="pagebreak_143"/><a id="pg143"/>increases ventricular contractility, whereas activation of the right stellate ganglion influences both rate and contractility. Activation of the right vagus nerve (parasympathetic) slows heart rate mainly through its influence on the pacemaker region, the sinuatrial (SA) node, whereas activation of the left vagus slows propagation of the impulse mainly through its effect on the atrioventricular (AV) node. Vagal activity has little direct effect on ventricular contractility.</div><div class="text" id="p0865">Postganglionic sympathetic nerve fibres from the cervical sympathetic ganglia reach the heart via the recurrent cardiac nerves. Parasympathetic fibres in the heart are derived from ganglion cells in the cardiac plexuses and atrial walls that are innervated by preganglionic cardiac branches of the vagus. Adrenergic, cholinergic and peptidergic endings have been demonstrated in the myocardium. Fibres often end close to muscle cells and blood vessels, but junctional specializations are not seen, and a gap of at least 100<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>nm remains between myocyte and axon. It is probable that neurotransmitters diffuse across this gap to the adjacent cells. Some of the endings represent efferent nerve terminals, while others function as pain receptors, mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0310"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0315">Excitation–contraction coupling in cardiac muscle</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0870">The molecular interaction between actin and myosin that underlies the generation of force is initiated by elevation of cytosolic calcium in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. However, there are significant differences in both the mechanisms by which this occurs and the physical arrangement and molecular composition of the contractile elements (reviewed in <a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">Bers (2002)</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0875">One of the major functional differences between cardiac and skeletal muscle is the way in which contractile force is regulated. Smoothness and gradation of contraction in skeletal muscle depend on recruitment and asynchronous firing of different numbers of motor units. Individual motor units can also build up a contraction through a brief series of re-excitations. In the heart, the entire mass of muscle must be activated almost simultaneously, and mechanical summation by re-excitation is not possible, because the cells are electrically refractory until mechanical relaxation has taken place (see below).</div><div class="text" id="p0880">As in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle contraction is initiated when calcium binds to troponin-C, a component of the regulatory protein complex on the thin filaments. During basal activity of the heart, the amount of calcium bound to troponin-C during each systole induces less than half-maximal activation of the contractile apparatus. Contractile force can therefore be increased by increasing cytosolic calcium and thus the amount bound to troponin-C. This is achieved by controlling the amount of free calcium that is released into the cytosol during systole.</div><div class="text" id="p0885">A special feature of the cardiac muscle cell is the long duration of its action potential. This is due to activation of voltage-dependent <span class="smallcaps">L</span>-type calcium channels in the sarcolemma by the initial depolarization, through which calcium enters the cell, sustaining the depolarization and so causing a long-lasting electrical plateau of equivalent length to the contraction. However, calcium influx during the plateau only accounts for about 25% of the elevation of cytosolic calcium; the rest is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.</div><div class="text" id="p0890">Action potentials are conducted into the T-tubules, where they activate L-type channels and calcium influx. This causes a localized increase in free calcium in the narrow space between the T-tubules and junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, which activates calcium release channels on the latter, causing calcium to flood out into the cytosol. This ‘calcium-induced calcium release’ is a vital component of cardiac muscle activation and is the principal or only mechanism by which calcium can be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the myocardium. This major difference between cardiac and skeletal muscle is reflected in tissue-specific isoforms of calcium release channels.</div><div class="text" id="p0895">Systolic activation is terminated on repolarization of the action potential by reuptake (sequestration) of calcium from the cytosol back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This is mediated by a high-affinity sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), which rapidly reduces cytosolic free calcium to resting levels. The activity of this ATPase controls the rate of decay of the calcium transient and is therefore a determinant of the rate of relaxation of the heart. The sarcoplasmic reticulum contains a cardiac form of calsequestrin, a homologue of the proteins found in skeletal and smooth muscle. This calcium-binding protein buffers the free calcium concentration inside the sarcoplasmic reticulum, allowing it to store considerable amounts of total calcium without increasing the gradient against which SERCA must pump. It may also modulate the activity of the calcium release channels (<a href="#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Györke and Terentyev 2008</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0900">Whilst SERCA therefore allows rapid relaxation of the myocardium, the calcium that entered the cell during the action potential must also be transported out again to prevent calcium overload. This is accomplished primarily by a sodium–calcium exchanger (NCX) in the sarcolemma, and to a much lesser extent by a sarcolemmal calcium ATPase. These act more slowly than SERCA, continuously removing calcium from the cell during the diastolic interval as calcium slowly leaks from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.</div><div class="text" id="p0905">The extent of the elevation of cytosolic calcium and therefore force generation during systole is determined by both the size of the initial stimulus (amount of calcium entering through L-type channels) and the amount of calcium stored within the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The greater the amount stored, the more is available for release. This provides an intrinsic mechanism for matching any increase in heart rate with a progressive increase in contractile force. At higher heart rates, more calcium enters per unit time, but as the diastolic interval is reduced there is less time for calcium to be removed from the cell by the sarcolemmal sodium–calcium exchanger. The amount of calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum therefore increases, so more can be released during systole. Increased heart rate is therefore coupled with an increase in force, a phenomenon called the staircase response.</div><div class="text" id="p0910">The most potent physiological means of enhancing cardiac contractility is through the action of β-adrenergic agents, specifically the sympathetic neurotransmitter noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and circulating adrenaline (epinephrine). Activation of β-adrenergic receptors produces cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which enhances calcium influx via L-type calcium channels during depolarization, so stimulating greater release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In addition, cyclic AMP enhances the activity of SERCA via promoting phosphorylation of an associated protein, phospholamban. This enables a more rapid reduction of the cytosolic calcium pump and accelerated relaxation, which is important when the heart rate is increased. Phosphorylation of troponin-I on the thin filaments also increases the rate of cross-bridge cycling, further accelerating relaxation.</div><section><a id="s0315"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0320">Dysfunction of cardiac muscle excitation–contraction coupling in disease</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0920">In coronary heart disease the myocardium may be inadequately perfused (myocardial ischaemia), leading to energy deficit, loss of contractility and eventually cell death. The process may culminate in irretrievable myocardial damage and progress to heart failure, which is the inability to provide adequate cardiac output for the tissues.</div><div class="text" id="p0925">The body responds to this challenge with a variety of neurohumoral mechanisms, including increased sympathetic stimulation to the heart, increasing heart rate and contractility via noradrenaline (norepinephrine; see above). Treatment includes administration of positive inotropic agents (drugs that increase contractility) such as β-adrenergic agonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors that prevent the breakdown of cyclic AMP. The classic positive inotropic drug is digitalis (digoxin), which at therapeutic doses causes partial inhibition of the sodium pump (sodium–potassium ATPase) that maintains the ionic gradient across the sarcolemma. This leads to a reduced sodium concentration gradient, impairing operation of the sarcolemmal sodium–calcium exchanger. Less calcium is therefore extruded from the cell, so more is left in the sarcoplasmic reticulum for release during systole, increasing force. However, positive inotropes are now only used in the short term because, if used chronically, they can hasten progression of the disease. The following explains why this is the case.</div><div class="text" id="p0930">An energy deficit has far-reaching consequences beyond the inhibition of actin and myosin interactions. ATP is vital for many cellular processes, in particular, the activities of the sodium pump and SERCA. Impaired operation of the sodium pump leads to reduced extrusion of calcium (see above). Inhibition of SERCA impairs calcium reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and relaxation at the end of systole. The net effect is calcium overload. Mitochondria can mitigate the effects by taking up calcium, but eventually this causes mitochondrial damage and so worsens the energy deficit. As ATP falls further, operation of the sodium pump declines, the ionic gradient is dispersed and the cell depolarizes, causing calcium entry through <span class="smallcaps">L</span>-type channels, which worsens the calcium overload and leads to cell death. Positive inotropes, by increasing both cytosolic calcium and energy requirements, will clearly worsen the situation.</div><div class="text" id="p0935">This sequence of events has led to development of agents that act via increasing the binding of troponin-C to calcium, rather than by increasing calcium. However, therapy for chronic heart failure is still currently focused on limiting disease progression, largely by interrupting neurohumoral compensation mechanisms. Paradoxically, this includes β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, and also antagonists to angiotensin II and aldosterone (reviewed in <a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Francis (2001)</a>), which may inhibit cardiac remodelling (see below).</div><div class="text" id="p0940">Channelopathies are conditions associated with mutations in genes encoding cardiac muscle ion channels (<a href="#bib56" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_56">Webster and Berul 2013</a>).

As the primitive heart tube is formed, the presumptive myocardial cells start to express genes that encode characteristic myocardial proteins, including myosin, actin, troponin and other components of the contractile apparatus. Myofibrils begin to appear in the developing myoblasts, and the first functional heart beats start soon afterwards.</div><div class="text" id="p0950">Committed cardiac myoblasts do not fuse to form multinucleated myotubes, as occurs in skeletal muscle, but remain as single cells coupled physically and electrically through intercellular junctions. Differentiated cardiac myocytes continue to divide during fetal development and withdraw from the cell cycle only after birth. This is markedly different from skeletal muscle development, when differentiation, including the activation of muscle-specific genes, coincides with withdrawal from the cell cycle. During fetal maturation, successive changes in gene expression give rise to the characteristics of fetal, neonatal and adult myocardium, and are responsible for the divergence of the properties of atrial and ventricular muscle cells.</div><div class="text" id="p0955">The regulatory mechanisms underlying differentiation of cardiac muscle appear to be distinct from those of skeletal muscle. It is anticipated that counterparts will be found for the transcriptional factors Myf-5, myogenin, MyoD and Myf-6, which are responsible for inducing differentiation of skeletal muscle. It is known that Tbx5 and Nkx2–5 are required for formation of atrial and ventricular myocardium (see <a href="../B9780702077050000136/B9780702077050000136.xhtml#f0035">Fig. 13.6</a>).<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="144" id="pagebreak_144"/><a id="pg144"/></div><div class="text" id="p0960"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="145" id="pagebreak_145"/>Concurrent with the development of contractile proteins, cardiac myocytes develop numerous specific intracellular vesicles containing substances shown to induce natriuresis and diuresis, and a family of polypeptides generally known as atrial natriuretic peptides. These vesicles develop from the Golgi complex in both atria and ventricles during fetal life but become restricted to atrial muscle in the adult. Atrial natriuretic peptide is measurable when the heart is recognizably four-chambered; almost all cells within the atria are capable of its synthesis.</div><div class="text" id="p0965">The impulse-generating (AV node) and conducting systems of the heart (AV node; bundle of His, Purkinje fibres) are formed from cardiac myocytes that differ in their morphology from the working myocardium of the heart chambers.

Physiological and pathophysiological stimuli can initiate cardiac remodelling (reviewed in <a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_28">Hill and Olson (2008)</a>). For example, increased loads as a result of exercise training or pregnancy induce physiological hypertrophy of the heart, where the ventricular walls thicken due to an increase in the size (but not number) of cardiac muscle cells. Conversely, hypertrophy resulting from cardiac damage, high blood pressure and/or extended activation of neurohumoral compensatory mechanisms (e.g. sympathetic stimulation, production of angiotensin II and aldosterone) can be maladaptive, increasing the risk and rate of progression of heart failure and sudden death due to arrhythmias.</div><div class="text" id="p0980">Both increased mechanical stress and circulating or local mediators can initiate the gene transcription and protein synthesis associated with cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling. At least part of the response is mediated through calcium-dependent mechanisms involving calcineurin, and isoforms of protein kinase C and calcium–calmodulin-dependent kinase, but growth factors, inflammatory cytokines and other humoral mediators also activate complex signalling cascades that modify activity of transcription factors. Notably, physiological and pathological cardiac remodelling show significant differences in gene transcription and expression of certain proteins; pathological hypertrophy is associated with phenotypic switching towards fetal and less efficient isoforms of contractile proteins such as myosin heavy chain (<a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Hill and Olson 2008</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0985">Chronic heart failure is regarded as irreversible and progressive, and pathological cardiac remodelling plays a major role in its progression. Therapy is largely focused on agents that suppress pro-remodelling pathways (e.g. β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists) and therefore slow progression (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Francis 2001</a>). However, recent developments have raised hope for future treatments that might reverse cardiac damage.</div><div class="text" id="p0990">In skeletal muscle, a population of precursor cells (satellite cells) is retained in adult life, constituting a pool of myoblasts capable of dividing, fusing with existing muscle fibres and initiating regeneration after damage.
