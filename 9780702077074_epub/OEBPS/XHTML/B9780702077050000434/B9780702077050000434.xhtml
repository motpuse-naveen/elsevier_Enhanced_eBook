The updated section on hair-cell structure and function includes current concepts of activation of the mechano-electrical transduction channel and in particular the composition of components of the linkage systems that connect stereocilia together and operate the channel. Our current understanding from animal models is that tip links contain protocadherin 15 and cadherin 23; this has implications for the understanding of a number of genetic deafness conditions such as Usher's syndrome and others based on mutations in the cadherins, as is summarized in the section on deafness, linked back to the discussion of stereocilia composition. There is some discussion of cochlear implants and a more speculative look at developments in cochlear repair and regeneration as possible future treatments for deafness.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">cochlea; deafness; hair cells; inner ear; otolithic organs; semi-circular canals</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The inner ear contains the organ of hearing and the organs of balance. All are located within the labyrinth, a series of interlinked cavities in the petrous temporal bone containing interconnected membranous sacs and ducts. All spaces within the labyrinth are filled with fluid. The different sacs contain sensory epithelia consisting of supporting cells and mechanosensory cells, the hair cells that underlie acoustico-lateralis sensory systems in all vertebrates. In humans, there are six such mechanosensory epithelia: the organ of Corti within the cochlea (the hearing organ); the utricle and saccule (static balance organs); and the cristae of the semicircular canals (dynamic balance organs). Whilst sharing the same basic structure, hair cells and the accessory systems that surround them show specific adaptations to each of the different sensory modalities.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">The disarticulated temporal bone is described in detail in <a href="../B9780702077050000422/B9780702077050000422.xhtml">Chapter 42</a>.

The bone is denser and harder than the other parts of the petrous bone, and it is therefore possible, particularly in young skulls, to dissect the bony labyrinth out from the petrous temporal bone.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">The osseous and membranous labyrinths are filled with fluid (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 43.2</span></a>). The gap between the internal wall of the osseous labyrinth and the external surface of the membranous labyrinth is filled with perilymph, a clear fluid with an ionic composition similar to that of other extracellular fluids, i.e. low in potassium ions and high in sodium and calcium. The membranous labyrinth contains endolymph, a fluid with an ionic composition more like that of cytosol, i.e. high in potassium ions and low in sodium and calcium. Moreover, the endolymphatic compartment has an electrical potential that, at least within the cochlea, is approximately 80<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mV more positive than the perilymphatic compartment (the endolymphatic potential). These differences in ionic composition and potential, maintained by homeostatic tissues in the walls of the labyrinth, are essential to maximize the sensitivity of the mechanosensory hair cells that convert the vibrations set up in the inner ear fluids by head or sound movements into electrical signals that are transmitted via the vestibulocochlear nerve to the vestibular and cochlear nuclei, respectively, in the brainstem.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000434/main.assets/f43-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 43.2</span> A transverse section through the left posterior semicircular canal and duct.</figcaption></figure></div><section><a id="s0015"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0025">Vestibule</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0030">The vestibule is the central part of the bony labyrinth and lies medial to the tympanic cavity, posterior to the cochlea and anterior to the semicircular canals (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 43.1</a>). It is somewhat ovoid in shape but flattened transversely, and (on average) measures 5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm from front to back and vertically, and 3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm across. In its lateral wall is the opening of the oval window (fenestra vestibuli), into which the base of the stapes inserts, and to which the base of the stapes is attached by an annular ligament. Anteriorly, on the medial wall, is a small spherical recess that contains the saccule; it is perforated by several minute holes, the macula cribrosa media, which transmit fine branches of the vestibular nerve to the saccule. Behind the recess is an oblique vestibular crest, the anterior end of which forms the vestibular pyramid. This crest divides below to enclose a small depression, the cochlear recess, which is perforated by vestibulocochlear fascicles as they pass to the vestibular end of the cochlear duct. Posterosuperior to the vestibular crest, in the roof and medial wall of the vestibule, is the elliptical recess (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 43.1B</span></a>), which contains the utricle. The pyramid and adjoining part of the elliptical recess are perforated by a number of holes, the macula cribrosa superior; those in the former transmit nerves to the utricle and those in the latter transmit nerves to the ampullae of the anterior and lateral semicircular canals (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 43.1B</a>). The region of the pyramid and elliptical recess corresponds to the superior vestibular area in the internal acoustic meatus (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 43.3</a>). The vestibular aqueduct opens below the elliptical recess. It reaches the posterior surface of the petrous bone and contains one or more small veins and part of the membranous labyrinth, the endolymphatic duct (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 43.1C</span></a>). In the posterior part of the vestibule are the five openings of the semicircular canals; in its anterior wall is an elliptical opening that leads into the scala vestibuli of the cochlea.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><a id="f0120"/><a id="cap0120"/><a id="bspara0010"/><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000434/main.assets/f43-01ac-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000434/main.assets/f43-01de-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000434/main.assets/on43-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><div id="bpar0035"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 43.1</span> The bony labyrinth. <span class="bold">A</span>, Lateral aspect. <span class="bold">B</span>, Interior. <span class="bold">C</span>, The membranous labyrinth (blue) projected on to the bony labyrinth.<span class="bold">D–E</span>, 3D renderings of the cochlea and round window.

Phylogenetic studies suggest that the arc sizes of the semicircular canals in humans and other primates may be functionally linked to sensory control of body movements. The angulation and dimensions of the canals may be related to locomotor behaviour and possibly to agility, or more specifically to the frequency spectra of natural head movements (see review by <a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_26">Spoor and Zonneveld (1998)</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0035">Cochlea</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0060">The cochlea (from the Greek <span class="italic">cochlos</span> for snail) is the most anterior part of the labyrinth, lying in front of the vestibule (see <a href="#f0010">Figs 43.1</a>, <a href="#f0050">43.9A</a>). It is 5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm from base to apex, and 9<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm across its base. Its apex, or cupula, points towards the anterosuperior area of the medial wall of the tympanic cavity (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 43.9A</a>). Its base faces the bottom of the internal acoustic meatus and is perforated by numerous apertures for the cochlear nerve. The cochlea has a conical central bony core, the modiolus, and a spiral canal runs around it. A delicate osseous spiral lamina (or ledge) projects from the modiolus, partially dividing the canal (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 43.9B</a>). Within this bony spiral lies the membranous cochlear duct, attached to the modiolus at one edge and to the outer cochlear wall by its other edge. There are therefore three longitudinal channels within the cochlea. The middle canal (the cochlear duct or scala media) is blind and ends at the apex of the cochlea; its flanking channels communicate with each other at the modiolar apex at a narrow slit, the helicotrema (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 43.1C</a>). Two distensible membranes form the upper and lower bounds of the scala media. One is Reissner’s membrane, the thin vestibular membrane that separates the scala media from the scala vestibuli. The other is the basilar membrane, which forms the partition between the scala media and the scala tympani. The organ of Corti, the sensory epithelium of hearing, sits on the inner surface of the basilar membrane. At the base of the scala vestibuli is the oval window (fenestra vestibuli), which leads on to the vestibular cavity but is sealed by the footplate of the stapes. The scala tympani is separated from the tympanic cavity by the secondary tympanic membrane at the round window (fenestra cochleae). The central cochlear core, the modiolus, has a broad base near the lateral end of the internal acoustic meatus, where it corresponds to the spiral tract (tractus spiralis foraminosus). There are several openings in this area for the fascicles of the cochlear nerve: those for the first 1½ turns run through the small holes of the spiral tract, and those for the apical turn run through the hole that forms the centre of the tract. Canals from the spiral tract go through the modiolus and open in a spiral sequence into the base of the osseous spiral lamina. Here the small canals enlarge and fuse to form Rosenthal’s canal, a spiral canal in the modiolus that follows the course of the osseous spiral lamina and contains the spiral ganglion (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 43.9B</a>). The main tract continues through the centre of the modiolus to the cochlear apex.</div><div class="text" id="p0065">The osseous cochlear canal spirals for about 2¾ turns around the modiolus and is 35<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm long. At its first turn, the canal bulges towards the tympanic cavity, where it underlies the promontory. At the base of the cochlea, the canal is 3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm in diameter but it becomes progressively reduced in diameter as it spirals apically to end at the cupula. In addition to the round and oval windows, which are the two main openings at its base, the canal has a third, smaller opening for the cochlear aqueduct or canaliculus. The latter is a minute funnel-shaped canal that runs to the inferior surface of the petrous temporal bone; it transmits a small vein to the inferior petrosal sinus and connects the subarachnoid space to the scala tympani.</div><div class="text" id="p0070">The osseous or primary spiral lamina is a ledge that projects from the modiolus into the osseous canal like the thread of a screw (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 43.9B</a>). It is attached to the inner edge of the basilar membrane and ends in a hook-shaped hamulus at the cochlear apex, partly bounding the helicotrema (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 43.1C</a>). From Rosenthal’s canal, many tiny canals, the habenula perforata, radiate through the osseous lamina to its rim, where they each carry a fascicle of the cochlear nerve through the foramen nervosum to the organ of Corti. A secondary spiral lamina projects inwards from the outer cochlear wall towards the osseous spiral lamina and is attached to the outer edge of the basilar membrane. It is most prominent in the lower part of the first turn; the gap between the two laminae increases progressively towards the cochlear apex, which means that the basilar membrane is wider at the apex of the cochlea than at the base.</div></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0040">Microstructure of the bony labyrinth</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0075">The wall of the bony labyrinth is lined by fibroblast-like perilymphatic cells and extracellular matrix fibres (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 43.2</a>). The morphology of the cells varies in different parts of the labyrinth. Where the perilymphatic space is narrow, as in the cochlear aqueduct, the cells are reticular or stellate in form; they give off sheet-like cytoplasmic extensions that cross the extracellular space. Where the space is wider, as in the scalae vestibuli and tympani of the cochlea and much of the vestibule, the perilymphatic cells on the periosteum and the external surface of the membranous labyrinth are extremely flat and resemble a squamous epithelium. Elsewhere, on parts of the perilymphatic surface of the basilar membrane, the cells are cuboidal.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">Recent evidence suggests that micropores or canaliculi (canaliculi perforantes) (0.2–23.0<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm diameter) are more widely distributed within the bony surfaces lining the perilymphatic space than was previously suspected; they are numerous in the peripheral and modiolar portions of the osseous spiral lamina and the floor of the scala tympani, but sparse in the osseous wall of the scala vestibuli. The proposal that these canaliculi normally provide an extensive fluid communication channel between the scala tympani and the spiral canal of the cochlea could have implications not only for novel drug-based cochlear therapies delivered via the scala tympani and the delivery of stem cells or appropriate cell lines into the deafened cochlea, but also for the design of implanted perimodiolar electrode arrays (<a href="#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Shepherd and Colreavy 2004</a>). (For further reading about the changes in the inner ear that are induced by implanted cochlear electrodes, both acute and long-term, see <a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Keifer et al (2006)</a>.)</div><section><a id="s0035"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0045">Composition of inner ear fluids</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0085">Perilymph resembles cerebrospinal fluid in ionic composition, particularly in the scala tympani. Its composition differs a little between the two cochlear scalae: concentrations of potassium, glucose, amino acids and proteins are greater in the scala vestibuli.

This Y-shaped duct has a side branch to the endolymphatic duct, which passes to the endolymphatic sac, a small but functionally important expansion situated under the dura of the petrous temporal bone. From the saccule, a narrow canal, the ductus reuniens, leads to the base of the cochlear duct. These various ducts and sacs form a closed system of intercommunicating channels (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 43.1C</a>). Endolymph is resorbed into the cerebrospinal fluid from the endolymphatic sac, which therefore provides the site for the drainage of endolymph for the entire membranous labyrinth.</div><div class="text" id="p0115">The terminal fibres of the vestibular nerve are connected to the five specialized sensory epithelia (two maculae and three cristae) in the walls of the membranous labyrinth.

It is triangular or heart-shaped in surface view and lies horizontally with its long axis orientated anteroposteriorly and its sharp angle pointing posteriorly (<a href="#f0030"><span class="bold">Fig. 43.5</span></a>). It is flat except at the anterior edge, where it is gently folded in on itself, and it measures 2.8<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm long by 2.2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm wide. The mature form of the macula is reached early in development, but in the adult a bulge is often present on the anterolateral border; there is sometimes an indentation at the anteromedial border. The epithelial surface is covered by the otolithic membrane (statoconial membrane), a gelatinous structure in which many small crystals, the otoconia (otoliths, statoliths), are embedded. A curved ridge, the ‘snowdrift line’, runs along the length of the otolithic membrane. It corresponds to a narrow crescent of underlying sensory epithelium termed the striola, 0.13<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm wide. The density of sensory hair cells in this strip of epithelium is 20% less than in the rest of the macula. The striola is convex laterally and runs from the medial aspect of the anterior margin in a posterior direction towards, but not reaching, the posterior pole. The part of the macula medial to the striola is called the pars interna and is slightly larger than the pars externa, which is lateral to it. The significance of this area is that the sensory cells are functionally and anatomically polarized with respect to the midline of the striola (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 43.5</a>). The macula in each utricle is approximately horizontal when the head is in its normal position. Linear acceleration of the head in the horizontal plane will result in the otolithic membrane lagging behind the movement of the membranous labyrinth as a result of the inertia produced by its mass. The membrane thus maximally stimulates one group of hair cells by deflecting their bundles towards the striola whilst inhibiting others by deflecting their bundles away from it. Hence each horizontal movement of the head will produce a specific pattern of firing in utricular afferent nerve fibres.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0025"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000434/main.assets/f43-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0025"/><a id="fspara0025"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 43.4</span> A section of the utricular macula from a guinea pig, showing the relative positions of the hair cells and supporting cell nuclei.

Throughout most of their length they are securely attached, by much of their circumference, to the osseous walls. They are approximately one-quarter of the diameter of their osseous canals (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 43.2</a>). The medial ends of the anterior and posterior ducts fuse to form a single common duct, the crus commune, before entering the utricle. The lateral end of each canal is dilated to form an ampulla, within the ampulla of the osseous canal. The short segment of duct between the ampullae and utricle is the crus ampullaris.</div><div class="text" id="p0140">The membranous wall of each ampulla contains a transverse elevation (septum transversum), on the central region of which is a saddle-shaped sensory ridge, the ampullary crest, containing hair cells and supporting cells.

The axons lose their myelin sheaths as they perforate the basal lamina of the sensory epithelium.

The tip link is common to all types of hair cell and is thought to play a central role in transduction; mutations in the proteins that comprise the tip link are significant in Usher syndrome, which is characterized by decreased vestibular function, hearing loss and visual abnormalities. Deflection of the bundle towards the kinocilium results in depolarization of the hair cell and increases the rate of neurotransmitter release from its base.

In the saccule, the structural and functional polarity is the opposite, i.e. away from it. In the ampullary crests, the cells are orientated with their rows of stereocilia at right-angles to the long axis of the semicircular duct. In the lateral crest, the kinocilia are on the side towards the utricle, whereas in the anterior and posterior crests they are away from it. These different arrangements are important functionally because any given acceleration of the head maximally depolarizes one group of hair cells and maximally inhibits a complementary set, thus providing a unique representation of the magnitude and orientation of any movement (for further details, see <a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">Furness (2002)</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0185">The type I and II sensory cells are set within a matrix of supporting cells that reach from the base of the epithelium to its surface and form rosettes round the sensory cells, as seen in surface view.

An intermediate or rugose segment and a distal sac can be distinguished. In the intermediate segment, the epithelium consists of light and dark cylindrical cells. Light cells are regular in form and have numerous long surface microvilli with endocytic invaginations between them and large clear vesicles in their apical region. In contrast, dark cells are wedge-shaped and have a narrow base, few apical microvilli and dense, fibrillar cytoplasm.</div><div class="text" id="p0215">The endolymphatic sac has important roles in the maintenance of vestibular function. Endolymph produced elsewhere in the labyrinth is absorbed in this region, probably mainly by the light cells. Damage to the sac, or blockage of its connection to the rest of the labyrinth, causes endolymph to accumulate; this produces hydrops, which affects both vestibular and cochlear function. The epithelium is also permeable to leukocytes, including macrophages, which can remove cellular debris from the endolymph, and to various cells of the immune system that contribute antibodies to this fluid.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0085"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0095">Cochlear duct</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0225">The cochlear duct is a spiral tube that runs within the bony cochlea (see <a href="#f0010">Figs 43.1C</a>, <a href="#f0050"><span class="bold">Fig. 43.9</span></a>). The osseous spiral lamina projects for part of the distance between the modiolus and the outer wall of the cochlea and is attached to the inner edge of the basilar membrane. Above it is a thickened ridge of endosteum called the spiral limbus. The endosteum of the outer wall is thickened to form a spiral cochlear ligament that projects inwards as a triangular basilar crest attached to the outer rim of the basilar membrane. Immediately above this is a concavity, the external spiral sulcus (sulcus spiralis externus), above which the thick, highly vascular periosteum projects as a spiral prominence. Above the prominence is a specialized, thick epithelial layer, the stria vascularis. A second, thinner vestibular membrane, Reissner’s membrane, extends from the spiral limbus to the outer wall of the cochlea, where it is attached above the stria. Reissner’s membrane consists of two layers of squamous epithelial cells separated by a basal lamina. The side facing the scala vestibuli bears flattened perilymphatic cells, with tight junctions between them, creating a diffusion barrier. The endolymphatic side is lined by squamous epithelial cells with many microvilli; these are also joined by tight junctions and are involved in ion transport. The canal thus enclosed between the scala tympani and the scala vestibuli is the cochlear duct (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 43.9B</a>). It is triangular in cross-section throughout the length of the cochlea. The closed upper end, the lagena, is attached to the cupula. The lower end of the duct turns medially, narrowing into the ductus reuniens, and connects with the saccule (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 43.1C</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0050"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000434/main.assets/f43-07-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0040"/><a id="fspara0040"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 43.9</span> The cochlea. <span class="bold">A</span>, A horizontal section through the left temporal bone showing the position of the cochlea with respect to the tympanic cavity. <span class="bold">B</span>, A section through the second turn of the cochlea seen in <span class="bold">A</span>.

The apices of the sensory hair cells and the supporting cells it contains are joined by tight junctions to form the reticular lamina. The diffusion barriers that line the cochlear duct ensure that the apices of the sensory hair cells are bathed in endolymph, whereas their lateral and basal regions are bathed in perilymph.</div><div class="text" id="p0235">The stria vascularis lies on the outer wall of the cochlear duct, above the spiral eminence (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 43.9B–C</a>). It has a special stratified epithelium containing a dense intraepithelial capillary plexus and three cell types: superficial marginal, dark or chromophil cells; intermediate light, or chromophobe cells; and basal cells. The endolymphatic surface consists only of the apices of marginal cells. The intermediate and basal cells lie deeper within the stria and send cytoplasmic processes towards the surface, between the deeper parts of the marginal cells. The long descending cytoplasmic processes of the marginal dark cells and the ascending processes of the intermediate and basal cells envelop the intraepithelial capillaries. The stria vascularis is involved in ion transport and helps to produce the unusual ionic composition of endolymph. It is the source of the large positive endocochlear electrical potential, maintenance of which is directly dependent on adequate oxygenation of the epithelial cells, provided by the intraepithelial capillary plexus.</div><div class="text" id="p0240">The spiral ligament is lateral to the stria vascularis. It is composed of thick collagenous fibres interspersed with fibrocytic cells of several different types, and root cells that send large processes into the ligament from the region of the basilar crest. There is an extensive capillary network that parallels that of the stria vascularis. The fibrocytes and the root cells express connexins and have gap junctional systems (<a href="#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_19">Jagger et al 2010</a>) that allow transcellular transport of ions, although the two types of cell are not directly coupled. It is thought that potassium recycling from perilymph to endolymph is mediated partly through these gap junctional networks emanating from the Deiters’ cells underlying the sensory hair cells. Late-onset hearing loss (DFN3) is thought to be the result of fibrocyte degeneration (<a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_22">Minowa et al 1999</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0245">The osseous spiral lamina consists of two plates of bone between which are canals for the cochlear nerve fibres. On the upper plate, the periosteum is thickened to form the spiral limbus (limbus laminae spiralis) (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 43.9B</a>). It ends externally in the internal spiral sulcus, which in section is shaped like a C. Its upper part, the overhanging limbic edge, is the vestibular labium, and the lower tapering part is the tympanic labium, which is perforated by small holes (the habenula perforata) for branches of the cochlear nerve. The upper surface of the vestibular labium is crossed at right-angles by furrows, separated by numerous elevations, the auditory teeth (dentes acustici). The limbus is covered by a layer that appears superficially to be squamous epithelium; however, only the cells over the ‘teeth’ are flat, and those in the furrows are flask-shaped interdental cells. The epithelium is continuous with the epithelium in the internal spiral sulcus and on the inferior surface of Reissner’s membrane. During development, the interdental cells secrete some of the material that forms the tectorial membrane. The limbus contains fibrocytic cells interspersed with extracellular matrix.</div><section><a id="s0090"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0100">Basilar membrane</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0250">The basilar membrane stretches from the tympanic lip of the osseous spiral lamina to the basilar crest of the spiral ligament (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 43.9B–C</a>). It consists of two zones. The thin zona arcuata stretches from the spiral limbus to the bases of the outer pillar cells and supports the organ of Corti. It is composed of compact bundles of small (8–10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>nm diameter) collagenous filaments, mainly radial in orientation. The outer, thicker zona pectinata starts beneath the bases of the outer pillar cells and is attached to the crista basilaris.

The lower or tympanic surface of the basilar membrane is covered by a layer of vascular connective tissue and elongated perilymphatic cells. One vessel, the spiral vessel (vas spirale), is larger; it lies immediately below the tunnel of Corti.</div></section><section><a id="s0095"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0105">Organ of Corti</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0255">The organ of Corti consists of a series of epithelial structures that lie on the zona arcuata of the basilar membrane (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 43.9B–C</a>). The more central of these structures are two rows of cells: the internal (inner) and external (outer) pillar cells. The bases of the pillar cells are expanded, <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="759" id="pagebreak_759"/><a id="pg759"/>and rest contiguously on the basilar membrane, but their rod-like cell bodies are widely separated. The two rows incline towards each other and come into contact again at the heads of the pillars, enclosing between them and the basilar membrane the tunnel of Corti, which has a triangular cross-section (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 43.9C</a>). Internal to the inner pillar cells is a single row of inner hair cells. External to the outer pillar cells are three or four rows of outer hair cells. The bases of the outer hair cells are cupped by supporting cells called outer phalangeal (Deiters’) cells, except for a gap where cochlear axons synapse with them. The apical ends of the hair cells and apical processes of the supporting cells form a regular mosaic called the reticular lamina, which is covered by the tectorial membrane, a gel-like structure projecting from the spiral limbus. The reticular lamina is impervious to ions and thus maintains the electrochemical gradient between the fluids surrounding the apices and the basolateral membranes of the sensory hair cells. A narrow gap separates the tectorial membrane from the reticular lamina except where the apical stereocilia of the outer hair cells project to make contact with it.</div><div class="text" id="p0260">In addition to the tunnel of Corti, other intercommunicating spaces, the spaces of Nuel, surround the outer hair cells. This entire intercommunicating complex of spaces of Nuel and tunnel of Corti is filled with perilymph, which diffuses through the matrix of the basilar membrane. The fluid in these spaces is also sometimes called the cortilymph; it is possible that there are minor alterations in perilymphatic composition within it because it is exposed to the activities of synaptic endings and specialized excitable cells.</div><div class="text" id="p0265">Each pillar cell has a base or crus, an elongated scapus (rod) and an upper end or caput (head) (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 43.9C</a>); each crus and caput are in contact, but the scapi are separated by the tunnel of Corti. Electron microscopy shows many microtubules, 30<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>nm in diameter, arranged in linked parallel bundles of 2000 or more in the scapus, originating in the crus and diverging above the scapus to terminate in the head region. The nucleus is situated in the foot-like expansion resting on the basal lamina.</div><div class="text" id="p0270">There are almost 6000 inner pillar cells. Their bases rest on the basilar membrane near the tympanic lip of the internal spiral sulcus, and their bodies form an angle of approximately 60° with the basilar membrane. Their heads resemble the proximal end of the ulna, with deep concavities for the heads of the outer pillar cells, which they overhang to form the top of the tunnel of Corti. There are almost 4000 outer pillar cells. They are longer and more oblique than the inner pillar cells and form an angle of approximately 40° with the basilar membrane. Their heads fit into the concavities on the heads of the inner pillar cells and project externally between the first row of outer hair cells as thin processes that contact the processes of the Deiters’ cells. The distances between the bases of the inner and outer pillar cells increase from the cochlear base to its apex, whereas the angles they make with the basilar membrane diminish.</div><div class="text" id="p0275">Cochlear hair cells are the sensory transducers of the cochlea; collectively, they detect the amplitude and frequency of the sound waves that enter the cochlea. All cochlear hair cells have a common pattern of organization. They are elongated cells with a group of modified apical microvilli or stereocilia (which contain parallel arrays of actin filaments), similar to those of vestibular hair cells, and a group of synaptic contacts with cochlear nerve fibres at their rounded bases (<a href="#f0060"><span class="bold">Fig. 43.10</span></a>). The inner hair cells form a single row along the inner edge of inner pillar cells (and the spiral tunnel), whereas the outer hair cells are arranged in three or, in some regions of the human cochlea, in four or even five rows, interspersed with supporting cells (<a href="#f0060"><span class="bold">Fig. 43.10A</span></a>). These two groups have distinctive roles in sound reception; the differences in their detailed structure reflect this functional divergence. There are 3500 inner hair cells and 12,000 outer hair cells. The two sets of hair cells lean towards each other apically at about the same angles as the neighbouring inner and outer pillar cells. The geometric arrangement of these cells is very precise, and this pattern is closely related to the sensory performance of the cochlea.</div><div id="p0285"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0060"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000434/main.assets/on43-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0110"/><a id="fspara0115"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 43.10</span> Scanning electron micrographs of the surface of the organ of Corti (guinea pig). <span class="bold">A</span>, The reticular lamina.

The inner hair cells are surrounded by inner border cells and by inner phalangeal cells, which are attached externally to the heads of the inner pillar cells. The flat apical surface of each inner hair cell is elliptical when viewed from above, its long axis directed in the direction of the row of hair cells (see <a href="#f0060">Fig. 43.10A</a>). The breadth of the apex exceeds that of the inner pillar cells so that each inner hair cell is related to more than one inner pillar cell. The apex bears 50–60 stereocilia, arranged in several ranks of progressively ascending height, the tallest on the strial side. The tips of the shorter rows are connected diagonally to the sides of the adjacent taller stereocilia by thin filaments called tip links; each stereocilium is also connected to all its neighbours by a variety of lateral links. The height of a stereociliary row varies along the length of the cochlea, being tallest at the apex and shortest at its base. The stereociliary bases insert into a transverse lamina of dense fibrillar material, the cuticular plate, which lies immediately beneath the apical surface of each inner hair cell. The cuticular plate includes a small aperture containing a basal body. During development, a kinocilium containing microtubules is anchored here, a condition that persists in vestibular hair cells.</div><div class="text" id="p0295">At its base, each inner hair cell forms 10 or more synaptic contacts with afferent endings, each being marked by a presynaptic structure similar to the ribbon synapses of the retina. Occasionally, an efferent synapse makes direct contact with a hair cell base but these are usually presynaptic to the terminal expansions of afferent endings, rather than to the hair cell itself.</div><div class="text" id="p0300">Outer hair cells are long cylindrical cells that are nearly twice as tall as the inner hair cells (see <a href="#f0050">Figs 43.9C</a>, <a href="#f0060">43.10A</a>). There is a gradation of length: the outermost row is longest in any one cochlear region, and those of the cochlear apex are taller than those of the base. They are surrounded by the apical or phalangeal processes of the Deiters’ cells or, on the internal side of the inner row, by the heads of the outer pillar cells. The stereocilia, which may number up to 100 per cell, are arranged in three rows of graded heights; the tallest is on the outer side. The rows are arranged in the form of a V or W, depending on cochlear region, the points of the angles directed externally. The stereocilia are also graded in height according to cochlear region; those of the cochlear base are shortest. Like those of inner hair cells, the stereocilia possess tip links (see <a href="#f0060">Fig. 43.10B</a>) and other filamentous connections with their neighbours and are inserted at their narrow bases into a cuticular plate. The tallest stereocilia are embedded in shallow impressions on the underside of the tectorial membrane.</div><div class="text" id="p0305">The rounded nucleus is positioned near the base of the cell. Below the nucleus are a few ribbon-like synapses associated with afferent endings of the cochlear nerve. The latter are fewer in number and smaller than the cluster of efferent boutons that contact the base of the cell. The neurotransmitter at the afferent synapse in both inner and outer hair cells is glutamate whereas that of the efferent endings is acetylcholine, although other neurotransmitters or neuromodulators have been demonstrated.</div><div class="text" id="p0310">Cochlear hair cells respond with phenomenal speed and sensitivity to sound vibrations that cause submicron deflections of their stereociliary hair bundles.

This arrangement is significant for two reasons. The reticular lamina creates a highly impermeable barrier to the passage of ions other than via the mechanotransducer channels in the stereociliary membranes. It also forms a rigid support between the apices of the hair cells, coupling them mechanically to the movements of the underlying basilar membrane, which causes lateral shearing movements between the stereocilia and the overlying tectorial membrane. If there is hair cell loss as a result of trauma such as excessive noise, or ototoxic drugs, the supporting cells expand rapidly to fill the gap, disturbing the regular pattern of the reticular lamina (phalangeal scars) but restoring its function.</div><section><a id="s0105"/><section><a id="s9105"/><h5 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0110">Hair cell mechanotransduction</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0330">Mechanotransduction is central to both hearing and balance and is a phenomenon that is shared by all the sensory hair cells of vestibular and auditory epithelia. The basic mechanism is the same in all of the different types of hair cell and is dependent on common features of the hair bundle: specifically, the ‘staircase’ array of stereocilia and the tip links connecting the tips of shorter and adjacent taller stereocilia. Deflections of the bundle in an excitatory (depolarizing) direction cause tension in the tip link, which acts to open non-specific cationic mechanoelectrical transduction channels. The identity of these channels is now thought to be a protein, transmembrane channel-like protein 1 (TMC1), which, together with several known accessory proteins, is located in the membrane at the lower end of the tip link. Mutations in TMC1 are one of the commonest forms of genetic hearing loss. Influx of potassium and calcium ions through these channels, depolarizes the cell and leads to calcium influx through basolateral voltage-gated calcium channels, which causes release of neurotransmitter. The hair cells also have basolateral potassium channels that allow efflux of potassium into perilymph. The tip link that is central to this process consists of two molecules of cadherin 23 and two molecules of protocadherin 15, forming a strong twisted strand (<a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Hackney and Furness 2013</a>).

The vein of the cochlear aqueduct (inferior cochlear vein) usually drains into either the inferior petrosal sinus or the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein.

The non-glial zone sometimes extends into the cerebellopontine angle medial to the internal acoustic meatus in human vestibulocochlear nerves. During development, a gap of several weeks has been reported between the onset of Schwann cell myelination distally and glial myelination proximally; it has been suggested that the gap may coincide with the time of the final maturation of the organ of Corti. <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="761" id="pagebreak_761"/><a id="pg761"/>(For further details about the development of the human cochlear nerve, see <a href="#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_24">Ray et al (2005)</a>.)</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0070"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000434/main.assets/f43-10a-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000434/main.assets/f43-10b-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0050"/><a id="fspara0050"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 43.12</span> The vestibulocochlear nerve (human). <span class="bold">A</span>, A transverse section.

The otolithic organs detect linear acceleration due to gravitational pull (gravito-inertial acceleration) and the direction of other linear accelerations such as the up-and-down movements of the head that occur in running. They also respond when the head is tilted relative to gravity: so-called pitch (forward and backward tilting) and roll (side-to-side tilting) movements. The semicircular canals detect angular accelerations resulting from rotations of the head or body.</div><div class="text" id="p0425">The stereocilia in the apical hair bundles of the mechanosensitive hair cells in each of these organs are embedded in an overlying accessory gel-like structure, the otolithic membrane (in the utricle and the saccule) and the cupula (in the semicircular ducts). Their apical surfaces are bathed in endolymph; tight junctional complexes between the apices of the hair cells and their adjacent supporting cells separate the endolymph from the perilymph that bathes their basolateral surfaces. As noted earlier, deflection of the stereocilia (caused by displacements of their overlying accessory membranes by fluid movements in the membranous labyrinth) produces either an increased or a decreased rate of opening of the mechanotransduction channels at their tips, depending <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="762" id="pagebreak_762"/><a id="pg762"/>on whether they are deflected towards or away from the tallest row, respectively. The change in the membrane potential of the receptor cell is signalled to the brain as a change in the firing frequency of the vestibular nerve afferents (either an increase or a decrease of the basal resting discharge, depending on the direction of stimulation). The signals are compared centrally with visual and somatosensory signals, which also signal the position of the head in space (for a more detailed account, see <a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Furness (2002)</a>).</div><section><a id="s0165"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0170">Semicircular canals</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0430">Angular acceleration and deceleration of the head cause a counterflow of endolymph in the semicircular ducts in the semicircular canals, which deflects the cupula of each crista and displaces the stereociliary/kinociliary bundles. When a steady velocity of head movement is reached, the endolymph rapidly adopts the same velocity as the surrounding structures because of friction with the canal walls, so that the cupula and receptor cells return to their resting state. The three semicircular canals are orientated approximately at right-angles to each other, which means that all possible directions of acceleration can be detected. Directional sensitivity to head movement is coded by opposing receptor signals: the left and right semicircular canals of each functional pair (e.g. the left and right anterior canals) respond oppositely to any movement of the head that affects them (<a href="#f0075"><span class="bold">Fig. 43.13</span></a>).

They also detect shifts in position according to the extent to which the stereocilia are deflected. The two maculae are set at right-angles to each other, and the cells of both are orientated functionally in opposite directions across their striolar boundaries. Movement causes depolarization of the hair cells on one side of the striola and hyperpolarization of cells on the other side; because the striola is curved, small groups of hair cells on the macular epithelium each respond to a specific direction of head tilt or linear acceleration (<a href="#f0080"><span class="bold">Fig. 43.14</span></a>).

The chain of ossicles acts as a lever that increases the force per unit area at the round window by 1.2 times while the reduction in size of the round window compared with the tympanic membrane increases the force per unit area of the oscillating surface a further 17 times. This overcomes the inertia of the cochlear fluids and produces in them pressure waves that are conducted almost instantaneously to all parts of the basilar membrane. The latter varies continuously in width, mass and stiffness from the basal to the apical end of the cochlea. Each part of the basilar membrane vibrates, but only the region tuned to a specific frequency will respond maximally to a pure tone entering the ear. A wave of mechanical motion, the travelling wave, is propagated along the basilar membrane to the position where it responds maximally and then dies away again. With increasing frequency, the locus of maximum amplitude moves progressively from the apical to the basal end of the cochlea. The pattern of vibrations in the basilar membrane thus varies with the intensity and frequency of the acoustic waves reaching the perilymph. Because of the arrangement of the hair cells on the basilar membrane, these oscillations generate a largely transverse shearing force between the outer hair cells and the overlying tectorial membrane (in which the apices of the hair cell stereocilia are embedded). This movement depends on the mechanical properties of the entire organ of Corti, including its cytoskeleton, which stiffens this structure. The inner hair cell stereocilia, which probably do not touch the tectorial membrane, although they come very close to it, are likely to be stimulated by local movements of the endolymph. Displacement of the stereociliary bundle of a hair cell activates mechanoelectrical transduction channels near the tips of its stereocilia, and this allows potassium and calcium ions from the endolymph to enter the hair cell (see earlier and overview by <a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Fettiplace and Hackney (2006)</a>). This induces a depolarizing receptor potential <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="766" id="pagebreak_766"/><a id="pg766"/>and the release of neurotransmitter on to the cochlear afferents at the base of the cell. In this way, a specific group of auditory axons is activated at the position of maximal basilar membrane vibration.</div><div class="text" id="p0505">The mechanical behaviour of basilar membrane is responsible for a broad discrimination between different frequencies (passive tuning; see overview by <a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_1">Ashmore (2002)</a>), but fine frequency discrimination in the cochlea appears to be related to physiological differences between the hair cells. Individual tuning of hair cells may result from differences in shape, stereociliary length, or possibly variations in the molecular composition of sensory membranes and may have a role in cochlear amplification (active tuning).</div><div class="text" id="p0510">The activity of the outer hair cells appears to play an important part in regulating inner hair-cell sensitivity at specific frequencies. Outer hair cells can change length when stimulated electrically at frequencies of many thousands of cycles per second. The rapidity of these changes in length indicates a novel type of motile mechanism, which is believed to depend on conformational changes in prestin, a protein that displays piezoelectricity and is located in the plasma membrane of the cells (<a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Fettiplace and Hackney 2006</a>, <a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Hudspeth 2014</a>) (<a href="#f0105"><span class="bold">Fig. 43.19</span></a>). When the membrane potential of the outer hair cells changes, they generate forces along their axes. When the mechanoelectrical transduction channels open, they are thought to oppose the viscous forces that tend to damp down the vibration of the cochlear partition and adjust the mechanics of the organ of Corti on a cycle-by-cycle basis. Alternatively, they may alter the mechanics of the partition more slowly under the influence of the efferent pathway. At a particular frequency, an increase in the intensity of stimulus is signalled by an increase in the rate of discharge in individual cochlear axons. At greater intensities, it is signalled by the number of activated cochlear axons (recruitment).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0105"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000434/main.assets/f43-17-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0085"/><a id="fspara0085"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 43.19</span> The putative motors of outer hair cells. Outer hair cells can generate force, mechanically boosting sound-induced vibrations of the hair bundle and augmenting frequency tuning. Two mechanisms have been advanced to explain this cochlear amplifier: the somatic motor and the hair bundle motor. <span class="bold">A</span>, In the resting state, Cl<sup>–</sup> ions are bound to prestin molecules in the lateral membrane of the hair cell. When force is applied to the hair bundle, the cell is depolarized, the Cl<sup>–</sup> ions dissociate and the prestin changes conformation, reducing its area in the plane of the membrane and shortening the hair cell body (the somatic motor). Adaptation of mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channels, which are activated by bending of the stereocilia at their tapered base, also causes the hair bundle to produce extra force in the direction of the stimulus (the hair bundle motor). The amplitudes of the hair bundle movements have been exaggerated to illustrate the concept. <span class="bold">B</span>, The effects of the somatic motor (blue arrows) on the organ of Corti mechanics, which leads to downward motion of the reticular lamina (the upper surface of the organ of Corti) and a negative deflection of the hair bundle.

Because of their rich afferent supply, inner hair cells are believed to be the major source of auditory signals in the cochlear nerve. Some evidence for this view is based on the finding that animals treated with antibiotics that are specifically toxic to outer hair cells are still able to hear, but their sensitivity and frequency discrimination is impaired.</div><div class="text" id="p0520">Some electrical responses of the cochlea can be recorded with extracellular electrodes. The most significant is the endolymphatic potential, a steady potential recordable between the cochlear duct and the scala tympani, which is caused by the different ionic compositions of their fluids. As the resting potential of hair cells is approximately 70<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mV (negative inside) and the endolymphatic potential is positive in the cochlear duct, the total transmembrane potential across the apices of hair cells is 150<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mV. This is a greater resting potential than is found anywhere else in the body and provides the driving force for mechanotransduction and for the cochlear amplifier.</div><div class="text" id="p0525">Under stimulation by sound, a rapid oscillatory cochlear microphonic potential can be recorded. It matches the frequency of the stimulus and movements of the basilar membrane precisely and appears to depend on fluctuations in the conductance of hair cell membranes, probably of the outer hair cells. At the same time, an extracellular summating potential develops, a steady direct current shift related to the (intracellular) receptor potentials of the hair cells. Cochlear nerve fibres then begin to respond with action potentials that are also recordable from the cochlea. Intracellular recording of auditory responses from inner hair cells has confirmed that these cells resemble other receptors; their steady receptor potentials are related in size to the amplitude of the acoustic stimulus. At the same time, afferent axons are stimulated by synaptic action at the bases of the inner hair cells. They fire more rapidly as the vibration of the basilar membrane increases in amplitude, up to a threshold that depends on the sensitivity of the specific nerve fibre involved. Each inner hair cell is contacted by axons with response thresholds that range from 0 decibels sound pressure level (dBSPL), the approximate threshold of human hearing, to those that respond to intensities in excess of 100 dBSPL; the loudest sound tolerable is around 120 dBSPL. Each axon responds most sensitively to the frequency represented by its particular cochlear location, its characteristic frequency (see <a href="#f0100">Fig. 43.18</a>).<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="767" id="pagebreak_767"/><a id="pg767"/></div></section><section><a id="s0230"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0230">Central auditory pathway</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0530">The primary afferents of the auditory pathway arise from cell bodies in the spiral ganglion of the cochlea. The axons travel in the vestibulocochlear nerve, which enters the brainstem at the cerebellopontine angle. Afferent fibres bifurcate, and terminate in the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei (<a href="#f0110"><span class="bold">Fig. 43.20</span></a>; <a href="../B9780702077050000288/B9780702077050000288.xhtml">Ch. 28</a>). The dorsal cochlear nucleus projects via the dorsal acoustic stria to the contralateral inferior colliculus. The ventral cochlear nucleus projects via the trapezoid body or the intermediate acoustic stria to relay centres in either the superior olivary complex, the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus, or the inferior colliculus.

The dorsal cortex lies dorsomedially, and the external cortex lies ventromedially. Secondary and tertiary fibres ascend in the lateral lemniscus. They converge in the central nucleus, which projects to the ventral division of the medial geniculate body of the thalamus. The external cortex receives both auditory and somatosensory input. It projects to the medial division of the medial geniculate body and, together with the central nucleus, also projects to olivocochlear cells in the superior olivary complex and to cells in the cochlear nuclei. The dorsal cortex receives input from the auditory cortex and projects to the dorsal division of the medial geniculate body. Connections also run from the nucleus of the lateral lemniscus to the deep part of the superior colliculus, to coordinate auditory and visual responses.</div><div class="text" id="p0540">The ascending auditory pathway crosses the midline at several points both below and at the level of the inferior colliculus. However, the input to the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus and higher centres has a clear contralateral dominance; during the initial stages of cortical auditory processing, each hemisphere responds most strongly to the contralateral ear. The medial geniculate body is connected reciprocally to the primary auditory cortex, which lies in the posterior half of the superior temporal gyrus and also dives into the lateral sulcus as the transverse temporal gyri (Heschl’s gyri). Secondary areas of the auditory cortex are located in an adjacent belt region, and other regions of auditory association cortex have been described in a parabelt region beyond the secondary cortex.</div><div class="text" id="p0545">The corpus callosum, particularly the posterior third of the body, contains auditory interhemispheric fibres that originate from the primary and second auditory cortices.

Hemispheric differences for frequency selectivity (i.e. the ability of the cochlea to separate the acoustic frequencies along its length like an acoustic prism) and tonotopic organization have been reported, e.g. the right hemisphere appears to be most responsive to acoustic sound features such as pitch, whereas the left hemisphere seems to be more involved in processing temporal dynamics such as the phonological aspects of speech. Morphological asymmetries favouring the left hemisphere in the planum temporale and Heschl’s gyri have been correlated with left hemispheric dominance for language functions but a direct link between structure and function has not been clearly established; studies often show relative rather than absolute differences in hemispheric specialization for particular attributes.</div><div class="text" id="p0555">The transformation of the physical characteristics of sound into ‘auditory objects’ is thought to occur in the transition from primary to secondary auditory cortex.

Two causes of deafness are usually distinguished: conductive hearing loss and sensorineural hearing loss.</div><div class="text" id="p0570">Conductive hearing loss may result from trauma to the external or middle ears, blockage of the external acoustic meatus, or disruption of the tympanic membrane (e.g. by intense sounds or extreme pressure changes). It may also result from acute or chronic infection associated with a perforation of the tympanic membrane, as in acute otitis media. The ossicular chain may be disrupted by trauma, avascular necrosis of the long process of the incus following a middle ear infection or cholesteatoma. The most common cause of a conductive hearing loss is a middle ear effusion (glue ear), in which fluid that has replaced the normally air-filled middle ear impedes the movements of the tympanic membrane. Other less common causes include tympanosclerosis, in which calcium plaques are formed in the tympanic membrane and middle ear mucosa that stiffen the tympanic membrane and limit the mobility of the ossicular chain. Similarly, new bone laid down around the oval window and footplate of the stapes, otosclerosis, impedes stapes mobility and imparts a conductive hearing loss.</div><div class="text" id="p0575">Sensorineural hearing loss is the most prevalent form of hearing impairment. It refers commonly to loss or damage of the sensory hair cells or their innervation but can also result from lateral wall degeneration and loss of the endolymphatic potential. The hair cells are particularly <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="768" id="pagebreak_768"/><a id="pg768"/>vulnerable to mechanical trauma produced by high-intensity noise and to changes in their physiological environment caused by infection or hypoxia. These can lead to rapid degenerative processes that result in hair cell loss, often by apoptosis, and produce either hearing loss or vestibular dysfunction. These changes can be induced by drugs such as the aminoglycoside antibiotics, some diuretics and certain anticancer drugs. A decrease in cochlear sensitivity, presbyacusis, almost invariably occurs with age; hair cells at the high frequency end of the cochlea tend to be lost first. At least 60% of hearing loss may have a genetic basis, a significant proportion may be non-syndromic, and most of these genes are inherited in an autosomal recessive mode (<a href="../B9780702077050000161/B9780702077050000161.xhtml">Ch. 16</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0580">Ménière’s disease is a distressing disorder of the inner ear characterized by episodes of hearing loss, tinnitus and vertigo. Histological examination of an affected ear reveals endolymphatic hydrops (swelling of the endolymphatic spaces), suggesting poor drainage of the endolymph via the endolymphatic sac.</div><div class="text" id="p0585">Whilst some forms of conductive deafness are amenable to treatment, at present sensorineural hearing loss is irreversible. The main treatment options are an external hearing aid or a cochlear implant (CI). The external hearing aid is inserted into the auditory canal and provides amplified input to the inner ear, utilizing the residual hearing of the patient.</div><div class="text" id="p0590">Cochlear implants consist of an external microphone and sound processor on the side of the head behind the external ear, adjacent to a subcutaneous receiver attached to a multichannel electrode. The electrode is inserted into the inner ear (see below for surgical approaches) and is advanced as far as feasible along the cochlear spiral (<a href="#f0115">Fig. 43.21</a>). The sound processor transmits a digitized representation of environmental sound to the implant which converts it to electrical pulses along the electrode. The signal is spatially segregated through the different channels of the electrode and stimulates functional cochlear nerve fibres that remain within the deaf ear. Thus the different frequency components of the sound stimulus are presented along the tonotopic axis to stimulate as closely as possible the spiral ganglion neurones that in the intact ear would represent them. This generates a pattern of auditory nerve firing representing different frequency components along the auditory pathway, restoring some measure of sensitivity and frequency selectivity.</div><div id="p9590"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0115"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000434/main.assets/on43-05-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0115"/><a id="fspara0120"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 43.21</span> Radiographic image of a cochlear implant (CI) <span class="italic">in situ</span>. The CI has an external microphone that detects the acoustic signal and converts it to a digital signal with both temporal and spatial components. The signal is transmitted via an external coil using radiofrequencies to an internal telemetry coil connected to a sound processor: the two coils are held in place by magnets. The processed signal is sent to an intracochlear multichannel electrode array and the electrodes in the CI stimulate the the surviving spiral ganglion neurones. The internal device includes a ground electrode that is placed beneath the temporalis muscle for current return.</figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="text" id="p0595">The design of cochlear and, more recently, vestibular implants, particularly their electrodes and processing algorithms, is a rapidly advancing science, but is hampered by suboptimal information about the three-dimensional (3-D) neural architecture of the labyrinth and cochlea. Improved imaging techniques that preserve some of the smaller neural structures that might otherwise be destroyed by dissection techniques are being developed to answer this deficiency. For example, osmium tetroxide (OsO<sub>4</sub>) contrast enhanced micro-CT scanning of the inner ear in combination with post acquisition image processing using noise reduction and edge preserving filters before segmentation (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 43.1D–I</a>) (<a href="#bib27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_27">van den Boogert et al 2018</a>).</div><section><a id="s0240"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0240">Surgical approaches to the inner ear</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0605">The inner ear may be approached surgically in a number of ways. Many drugs, e.g. gentamicin and steroids, are now injected through the intact tympanic membrane, where they diffuse through the round window membrane to access the inner ear. The promontory that overlies the basal turn of the cochlea and the oval window may be opened through a tympanotomy (per-meatal elevation of the tympanic membrane). The semicircular canals are generally accessed by a transmastoid approach. In days gone by, such an approach would be used to fenestrate the lateral canal in the management of otosclerosis. The advent of stapes prostheses and stapedectomy rendered this operation obsolete. However, the transmastoid approach is the workhorse for much middle and inner ear surgery because it gives a wide exposure of all the vital structures. For patients with profound hearing loss, enlarging the mastoid aditus inferiorly (posterior tympanotomy) to produce a triangle bounded above by the fossa incudis, superficially by the chorda tympani and deeply by the descending portion of the facial nerve, gives access to the round window so that it can be instrumented and a multichannel cochlear electrode inserted into the scala tympani of the cochlea so that it lies against the spiral lamina and can stimulate the adjacent fibres of the cochlear nerve. This is then connected to the cochlear implant device, which is housed in an extension of the mastoid cavity. Posterior canal obliteration for cupulolithiasis not responsive to Epley’s manoeuvre is also undertaken through the mastoid. The endolymphatic sac may be approached by elevating the cortical bone of the anterolateral wall of the posterior cranial fossa, anterior to the sigmoid venous sinus and posterior to the posterior semicircular canal (below a line extended from the axis of the lateral semicircular canal). Decompression of the sac or a shunt procedure is favoured by some for the management of Ménière’s disease. Superior canal dehiscences, as seen in Minor’s syndrome, are repaired either through the mastoid or by using a middle fossa approach. In patients with intractable Ménière’s disease, the whole of the labyrinth can be removed through the mastoid. Vestibular nerve section and the removal of vestibular schwannomas are generally undertaken through retrosigmoid, retrolabyrinthine, translabyrinthine or middle fossa approaches. The choice of approach is dictated or influenced by the size of the tumour, desire or need to preserve hearing, and the surgeon’s choice. In recent years, the development of auditory brainstem implants has brought hope to those with profound hearing loss associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 or cochlear nerve aplasia. These devices are similar to a cochlear implant but the electrodes are placed directly into the cochlear nucleus within the brainstem through a retrosigmoid approach.</div></section></section></section></section><footer><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="768.e2" id="pagebreak_768.e2"/><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebib0010"/><h2 class="reftitle" id="s4010">References</h2><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebibsec0010"/><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib1"><!--<a hreef="#bib_1">1</a>. --><a id="ref0025"/><a href="#bib_1">Ashmore</a> J. <cite>The mechanics of hearing</cite>. In: Roberts D, ed. <cite><i>Signals and Perception: The Fundamentals of Human Sensation</i></cite>. Basingstoke and New York: Palgrave Macmillan; 2002:3–16.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib2"><!--<a hreef="#bib_2">2</a>. --><a id="ref0030"/><a href="#bib_2">Axelsson</a> A. <cite>Comparative anatomy of cochlear blood vessels</cite>. <cite><i>Am J Otolaryngol</i></cite>. 1988;9:278–290.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib3"><!--<a hreef="#bib_3">3</a>. --><a id="ref0035"/><a href="#bib_3">Blanks</a> R.H, Curthoys I.S, Markham C.H. <cite>Planar relationships of the semicircular canals in man</cite>. <cite><i>Acta Otolaryngol</i></cite>. 1975;80:185–196.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib4"><!--<a hreef="#bib_4">4</a>. --><a id="ref0040"/><a href="#bib_4">Bridger</a> M.W, Farkashidy J. <cite>The distribution of neuroglia and Schwann cells in the 8th nerve of man</cite>. <cite><i>J Laryngol Otol</i></cite>. 1980;94:1353–1362.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib5"><!--<a hreef="#bib_5">5</a>. --><a id="ref0045"/><a href="#bib_5">Chance</a> S.A, Casanova M.F, Switala A.E, et al. <cite>Minicolumnar structure in Heschl’s gyrus and planum temporale: asymmetries in relation to sex and callosal fiber number</cite>. <cite><i>Neuroscience</i></cite>. 2006;143:1041–1050.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib6"><!--<a hreef="#bib_6">6</a>. --><a id="ref0050"/><a href="#bib_6">Curthoys</a> I.S, Blanks R.H, Markham C.H. <cite>Semicircular canal radii of curvature (R) in cat, guinea pig and man</cite>. <cite><i>J Morphol</i></cite>. 1977;115:1–15.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib7"><!--<a hreef="#bib_7">7</a>. --><a id="ref0055"/><a href="#bib_7">Duman</a> D, Tekin M. <cite>Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness genes: a review</cite>. <cite><i>Front Biosci</i></cite>. 2013;17:2213–2236.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib8"><!--<a hreef="#bib_8">8</a>. --><a id="nspara1385"/>A review that summarizes genes and mutations reported in families with ARNSHL.
