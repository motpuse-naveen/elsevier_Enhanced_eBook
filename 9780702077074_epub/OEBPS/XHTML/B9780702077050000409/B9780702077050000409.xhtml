The pharynx is subdivided in nasopharynx, oropharynx and laryngopharynx. The nasopharynx has the pharyngeal tonsil and pharyngotympanic tube as most important structures as the oropharynx has the soft palate and palatine tonsils. The two named layers of fascia in the pharynx are the pharyngobasilar and buccopharyngeal fascia. Pharyngeal tissue spaces or deep neck spaces are subdivided in suprahyoid and infrahyoid portions. Anatomy of these spaces is crucial for understanding spread of infections and tumours. Transoral inside-out pharynx anatomy has become increasingly important as transoral resection has evolved as a standard treatment for pharyngeal cancer. The anatomy encountered during transoral surgery is presented as a new topic in this chapter. The important functions of the pharynx such as swallowing, breathing and speech are only possible through a complex teamwork of muscles. Anatomy of these muscles is described in detail first, followed by the anatomy of swallowing as a specific topic at the end of the chapter.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">deep neck spaces; hypopharynx; laryngopharynx; nasopharynx; oropharynx; pharyngeal tissue spaces; pharynx; transoral anatomy</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The pharynx is a 12–14<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm long musculomembranous tube shaped like an inverted cone. It extends from the cranial base to the lower border of the cricoid cartilage (the level of the sixth or seventh cervical vertebrae), where it becomes continuous with the oesophagus. The width of the pharynx varies constantly because it is dependent on muscle tone, especially of the constrictors. At rest, the pharyngo-oesophageal junction is closed as a result of tonic closure of the upper oesophageal sphincter; during sleep, muscle tone is low and the dimensions of the pharynx are markedly decreased (which may give rise to snoring and sleep apnoea). The pharynx is limited above by the posterior part of the body of the sphenoid and the basilar part of the occipital bone, and it is continuous with the oesophagus below. Behind, it is separated from the cervical part of the vertebral column and the prevertebral fascia covering longus colli and longus capitis, by loose connective tissue in the retropharyngeal space above and the retrovisceral space below.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">The muscles of the pharynx are three circular constrictors and three longitudinal elevators. The constrictors resemble three overlapping cones that arise from structures at the sides of the head and neck and pass posteriorly to insert into a midline fibrous band, the pharyngeal raphe. The arterial supply to the pharynx is derived from branches of the external carotid artery, particularly the ascending pharyngeal artery, but also from the ascending palatine and tonsillar branches of the facial artery, the maxillary artery (greater palatine and pharyngeal arteries and the artery of the pterygoid canal), and dorsal lingual branches of the lingual artery. The pharyngeal veins begin in a plexus external to the pharynx, receive meningeal veins and a vein from the pterygoid canal, and usually end in the internal jugular vein. Lymphatic vessels from the pharynx and cervical oesophagus pass to the deep cervical nodes, either directly or via the retropharyngeal or paratracheal nodes. The motor and sensory innervation is principally via branches of the pharyngeal plexus.</div><div class="text" id="p0020">The pharynx lies behind, and communicates with, the nasal, oral and laryngeal cavities via the nasopharynx, oropharynx and laryngopharynx, respectively (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Figs 40.1</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">40.2</span></a>). Its lining mucosa is continuous with that lining the pharyngotympanic tubes, nasal cavity, mouth and larynx. The retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal spaces surround the pharynx. The retropharyngeal space lies anterior to the prevertebral and alar fascia and thus to the alar space (so-called danger space) that lies between them (<a href="#bib64" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_64">Scali et al 2015</a>).

The nasopharynx has a roof, a posterior wall, two lateral walls and a floor. All are rigid boundaries except the floor, which can be raised or lowered by the soft palate: the cavity of the nasopharynx is therefore never obliterated by muscle action, unlike the cavities of the oro- and laryngopharynx. The nasal and oral parts of the pharynx communicate through the pharyngeal isthmus, which lies between the posterior border of the soft palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall. Elevation of the soft palate and constriction of the palatopharyngeal sphincter close the isthmus during swallowing.</div><div class="text" id="p0040">The roof and posterior wall form a continuous concave slope that leads down from the nasal septum to the oropharynx. It is bounded above by mucosa overlying the posterior part of the body of the sphenoid, and further back by the basilar part of the occipital bone as far as the pharyngeal tubercle. Further down, the mucosa overlies the pharyngobasilar fascia and the upper fibres of the superior constrictor, and behind these, the anterior arch of the atlas. A lymphoid mass, the pharyngeal tonsil (adenoid, nasopharyngeal tonsil), lies in the mucosa of the upper part of the roof and posterior wall in the midline.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">The lateral walls of the nasopharynx display a number of important surface features. On either side, each receives the opening of the pharyngotympanic tube (auditory or Eustachian tube), situated 10–12<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm behind and a little below the level of the posterior end of the inferior nasal concha (see <a href="#f0010">Figs 40.1</a>, <a href="#f0015">40.2</a>). The tubal aperture is approximately triangular in shape and is bounded above and behind by the tubal elevation that consists of mucosa overlying the protruding pharyngeal end of the cartilage of the pharyngotympanic tube. A vertical mucosal fold, the salpingopharyngeal fold, descends from the tubal elevation behind the aperture (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 40.2</a>) and covers salpingopharyngeus in the wall of the pharynx (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 40.3</span></a>); a smaller salpingopalatine fold extends from the anterosuperior angle of the tubal elevation to the soft palate in front of the aperture. As levator veli palatini enters the soft palate, it produces an elevation of the mucosa immediately around the tubal opening (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 40.3</a>). A small variable mass of lymphoid tissue, the tubal tonsil, lies in the mucosa immediately behind the opening of the pharyngotympanic tube. Further behind the tubal elevation there is a variable depression in the lateral wall, the lateral pharyngeal recess (fossa of Rosenmüller), located between the posterior wall of the nasopharynx and the salpingopharyngeal fold.

The mucosa of the nasopharynx is separated from the parapharyngeal space by the buccopharyngeal and pharyngobasilar fasciae. The carotid space, enclosed by the carotid sheath, lies posterior and lateral to the parapharyngeal space. The glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory and hypoglossal nerves lie within the upper part of the carotid space and come to lie within the superior part of the parapharyngeal space together with the sympathetic chain. The carotid sheath is partially deficient at this level, becoming confluent with the retrostyloid compartment of the parapharyngeal space (<a href="#bib71" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_71">Warshafsky et al 2012</a>). The foramen lacerum lies superolateral to the fossa of Rosenmüller. The foramen ovale lies still further laterally and transmits the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, which passes through the parapharyngeal space and then the masticator space to innervate the muscles of mastication. The retropharyngeal space is posterior to the nasopharynx. The cartilagenous pharyngotympanic tube and levator veli palatine pass through a deficiency in the pharyngobasilar fascia around the sinus of Morgagni. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma typically spreads along the pharyngotympanic tube, causing secretory otitis media. It breaches the pharyngobasilar fascia anteriorly to infiltrate the pterygoid muscles and invades intracranial space through the foramen ovale by perineural spread along the mandibular nerve (<a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Hyare et al 2010</a>).</div><section><a id="s0025"/><section><a id="s0030"/><section><a id="s0035"/><section><a id="s0040"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0030">Microstructure of non-tonsillar nasopharynx</p><div class="textfl" id="p0055">The nasopharyngeal epithelium anteriorly is ciliated, pseudostratified respiratory in type with goblet cells (see <a href="../B9780702077050000021/B9780702077050000021.xhtml#f0015">Fig. 2.2D</a>).

The newer endoscopic techniques avoid many of the complications previously seen with blind curettage and caused by hyperextension of the cervical spine, such as damage to the prevertebral fascia, anterior spinal ligaments and tubal orifice. Direct vision and diathermy also facilitate haemostasis. Removal of the pharyngeal tonsil in children with submucosal clefts can result in velopharyngeal insufficiency and cause excessive nasality of speech and nasal regurgitation: submucosal clefts are usually visible by careful clinical examination including palpation before surgery.

Within the cartilaginous tube, the floor contains numerous mucus-producing goblet cells and is heavily rugated, whereas the walls in the upper half of the tube contain fewer goblet cells and are generally smooth. Mucosal folding is a feature of the childhood tube; the increased surface area and concomitant increased numbers of ciliated cells are presumed to facilitate improved clearance of the mucociliary blanket. Folds decrease with age up to the age of 20 years, when adult characteristics are reached. Mucous glands predominate in neonates; mucous, serous and mixed glands are present in equal amounts in young children; and serous glands predominate in later life (<a href="#bib51" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_51">Orita et al 2002</a>).

The tone in the muscles is reduced during sleep, and is also affected by alcohol and other sedatives, hypothyroidism and a variety of neurological disorders. If the dilator muscle tone is insufficient, the walls of the pharynx may become apposed. Intermittent pharyngeal obstruction may cause snoring, and complete obstruction results in apnoea, hypoxia and hypercarbia leading to arousal and sleep disturbance. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a serious syndrome affecting up to 4% of middle-aged people. It has potentially life-threatening consequences. The pathophysiological causes of OSA include an anatomically small upper airway, in which augmented pharyngeal dilator muscle activation can maintain airway patency when the individual is awake but not when asleep, coupled with instability in the respiratory control system. Individuals with OSA may demonstrate some or all of the following anatomical features: an increase in soft palate length and thickness; a retrusive or short mandible; lowered hyoid bone position; increased amount of fat in the soft palate and parapharyngeal tissues. While these studies differ in their assessment of the relative incidence and significance of these factors, they all confirm that the anatomical changes in OSA have the combined effect of both narrowing and shortening the airway. At the same time, physiological mechanisms that exist to ensure that the airways remain dilated and patent seem to suffer a sleep-induced fall in activity in OSA sufferers. The muscles primarily responsible for maintaining a dilated airway under normal conditions are the muscles that control the position of the hyoid bone, the infrahyoid and suprahyoid muscles, the muscles of the tongue, especially genioglossus, and the muscles that move the soft palate.

Its medial, free, surface usually presents a pitted appearance. The pits, 10–20 in number, lead into a system of blind-ending, often highly branching, crypts that extend through the whole thickness of the tonsil and almost reach the connective tissue hemicapsule. In a healthy tonsil, the openings of the crypts are fissure-like and the walls of the crypt lumina are collapsed so that they are in contact with each other. The human tonsil is polycryptic: the branching crypt system reaches its maximum size and complexity during childhood. The mouth of a deep tonsillar cleft (intratonsillar cleft, recessus palatinus) opens in the upper part of the medial surface of the tonsil. Often erroneously called the supratonsillar fossa, it is not yet situated above the tonsil but within its substance. The mouth of the cleft is semilunar, curving parallel to the convex dorsum of the tongue in the sagittal plane. The upper wall of the recess contains lymphoid tissue that extends into the soft palate as the pars palatina of the palatine tonsil. After the age of 5 years, this embedded part of the tonsil diminishes in size. There is a tendency for the whole tonsil to involute from the age of 14 years and for the tonsillar bed to flatten out. During young adult life, a mucosal fold, the plica triangularis, stretches back from the palatoglossal arch down to the tongue. It is infiltrated by lymphoid tissue and frequently represents the most prominent (anteroinferior) portion of the tonsil. It rarely persists into middle age.</div><div class="text" id="p0240">The lateral or deep surface of the tonsil spreads downwards, upwards and forwards. Inferiorly, it invades the dorsum of the tongue; superiorly, it invades the soft palate; and, anteriorly, it may extend for some distance under the palatoglossal arch. This deep, lateral aspect is covered by a layer of fibrous tissue, the tonsillar hemicapsule. This is separable with ease for most of its extent from the underlying muscular wall of the pharynx, formed here by the superior constrictor and sometimes by the anterior fibres of palatopharyngeus, with styloglossus on its lateral side. Anteroinferiorly, the hemicapsule adheres to the side of the tongue and to palatoglossus and palatopharyngeus. In this region, the tonsillar artery, a branch of the facial artery, pierces the superior constrictor to enter the tonsil, accompanied by venae comitantes. An important and sometimes large vein, the external palatine or paratonsillar vein, descends from the soft palate lateral to the tonsillar hemicapsule before piercing the pharyngeal wall. Haemorrhage from this vessel from the upper angle of the tonsillar fossa may complicate tonsillectomy. The muscular wall of the tonsillar fossa separates the tonsil from the ascending palatine artery, and occasionally from the tortuous facial artery, which may lie near the pharyngeal wall at the lower tonsillar level. The glossopharyngeal<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="708" id="pagebreak_708"/><a id="pg707.e1"/><a id="pg708"/>nerve lies immediately lateral to the muscular wall of the tonsillar fossa (see <a href="#f0025">Figs 40.3A</a>, <a href="#f0055">40.6A</a>); it is at risk if the wall is pierced and is commonly temporarily affected by oedema following tonsillectomy, resulting in a disturbance of taste (<a href="#bib48" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_48">Ohtsuka et al 2002</a>).

It is covered on its oropharyngeal aspect by non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. The whole of the tonsil is supported internally by a delicate meshwork of fine collagen type III (reticulin) fibres which are condensed in places to form more robust connective tissue septa that also contain elastin. These septa partition the tonsillar parenchyma, and merge at their ends with the dense irregular fibrous hemicapsule on the deep aspect of the tonsil and with the lamina propria on the pharyngeal surface. Blood vessels, lymphatics and nerves branch or join within the connective tissue condensations.

The basal lamina of this epithelium is discontinuous. Although the oropharyngeal surface is unbroken, the epithelium may become exceedingly thin in places, so that only a tenuous cytoplasmic layer separates the pharyngeal lumen from the underlying lymphocytes. Epithelial cells are held together by small desmosomes, anchored into bundles of keratin filaments. Interdigitating dendritic cells (antigen-presenting cells, APCs) are also present. The intimate association of epithelial cells and lymphocytes facilitates the direct transport of antigen from the external environment to the tonsillar lymphoid cells, i.e. reticulated epithelial cells are functionally like the microfold (M) cells of the gut.

The mantle zones of the follicles, each with closely packed small lymphocytes, form a dense cap, always situated on the side of the follicle nearest to the mucosal surface. These cells are the products of B-lymphocyte proliferation within the germinal centres. Extrafollicular, or T-lymphocyte, areas contain a specialized microvasculature including high endothelial venules (HEVs), through which circulating lymphocytes enter the tonsillar parenchyma. The lymphoid tissue of the reticulated crypt epithelium contains predominantly IgG- and IgA-producing B lymphocytes (including some mature plasma cells), T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells.

Three arteries enter the tonsil at its lower pole. The largest is the tonsillar artery, a branch of the facial artery, or sometimes of the ascending palatine artery.

The other arteries found at the lower pole are the dorsal lingual branches of the lingual artery which enter anteriorly, and a branch from the ascending palatine artery which enters posteriorly to supply the lower part of the palatine tonsil. The upper pole of the tonsil also receives branches from the ascending pharyngeal artery which enter the tonsil posteriorly, and from the descending palatine artery and its branches, the greater and lesser palatine arteries. All of these arteries enter the deep surface of the tonsil, branch within the connective tissue septa, narrow to become arterioles and then give off capillary loops into the follicles, interfollicular areas and the cavities within the base of the reticulated epithelium. The capillaries rejoin to form venules, many with high endothelia, and the veins return within the septal tissues to the hemicapsule as tributaries of the pharyngeal drainage.

The jugulodigastric nodes are typically enlarged in tonsillitis, when they project beyond the anterior border of sternocleidomastoid and are palpable superficially 1–2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm below the angle of the mandible; when enlarged, they represent the most common swelling in the neck.</div></section><section><a id="s0250"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0155">Innervation</p><div class="textfl" id="p0275">The tonsillar region is innervated by tonsillar branches of the maxillary and glossopharyngeal nerves. The fibres from the maxillary nerve pass through, but do not synapse in, the pterygopalatine ganglion; they are distributed through the lesser palatine nerves and form a plexus (the circulus tonsillaris) around the tonsil together with the tonsillar branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve. Nerve fibres from this plexus are also distributed to the soft palate and the region of the oropharyngeal isthmus. The tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve supplies the mucous membrane lining the tympanic cavity.

Other indications include airway obstruction caused by extremely large or infected palatine tonsils and a recurrent peritonsillar abscess. Tonsils are also removed in an older age group when malignancy is suspected. Tonsillectomy using a guillotine is no longer practised because it was associated with an unacceptable incidence of postoperative haemorrhage. Most tonsils are now removed by dissection in the plane of the fibrous hemicapsule, followed by ligation or electrocautery to the vessels that are divided during the procedure. The nerve supply to the tonsil is so diffuse that tonsillectomy under local anaesthesia can be performed successfully by local infiltration rather than by blocking the main nerves. Surgical access to the glossopharyngeal nerve and/or the styloid process may be achieved by separating the fibres of superior constrictor.</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0260"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0165">Waldeyer’s ring</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0290">Waldeyer’s ring is a circumpharyngeal ring of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue that surrounds the openings into the digestive and respiratory tracts.

The fibrous layer that supports the pharyngeal mucosa is thickened above the superior constrictor to form the pharyngobasilar fascia (see <a href="#f0060">Fig. 40.10</a>). It is attached to the basilar part of the occipital bone and the petrous part of the temporal bone medial to the pharyngotympanic tube, and to the posterior border of the medial pterygoid plate and the pterygomandibular raphe. Inferiorly, it diminishes in thickness but is strengthened posteriorly by a fibrous band, the median pharyngeal raphe of the constrictors. The buccopharyngeal fascia covers the superior constrictor and passes forwards over the pterygomandibular raphe to cover buccinator.</div></section><section><a id="s9087"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle9195">Pharyngeal Tissue Spaces</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0315">Pharyngeal tissue spaces can be subdivided into peripharyngeal and intrapharyngeal spaces: the terms ‘deep neck’ space, subdivided into supra- and infra-hyoid spaces, are commonly used clinically. The peripharyngeal suprahyoid neck spaces include the submandibular and submental spaces anteriorly, the retropharyngeal space posteriorly and the parapharyngeal spaces laterally. The retropharyngeal space is an area of loose connective tissue that lies behind the pharynx and anterior to the prevertebral fascia, extending upwards to the base of the skull and downwards to the retrovisceral space in the infrahyoid part of the neck. Each parapharyngeal space passes laterally around the pharynx and is continuous with the retropharyngeal space. However, unlike the retropharyngeal space, it is a space that is restricted to the suprahyoid region. It is bounded medially by the pharynx, laterally by the pterygoid muscles (where it is part of the infratemporal fossa) and by the sheath of the parotid gland, superiorly by the base of the skull, and inferiorly by suprahyoid structures, particularly the sheath of the submandibular gland. It may be helpful to think of the retropharyngeal space as shaped like an inverted pyramid extending from the base of the skull to the greater cornu of the hyoid bone. The parapharyngeal space can be subdivided into an anterior, prestyloid, compartment and a posterior, retrostyloid, compartment (<a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">Maran et al 1984</a>). The prestyloid compartment contains the retromandibular portion of the parotid gland and minor or ectopic salivary glandular tissue, branches of the mandibular division of the mandibular nerve, maxillary artery, ascending pharyngeal artery and a pharyngeal venous plexus, fat and lymph nodes (<a href="#bib66" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_66">Shin et al 2001</a>). The retrostyloid compartment contains the internal carotid artery, the internal jugular vein, the glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory and hypoglossal nerves, the sympathetic chain, fat and lymph nodes. The fascia surrounding the carotid is incomplete at the level above the mandibular angle (hence the term carotid space). Any of these structures may be damaged by penetrating injuries directed posterolaterally in the region; more lateral injuries may result in penetration of the parotid gland.</div><div class="text" id="p0320">An intrapharyngeal space potentially exists between the inner surface of the constrictor muscles and the pharyngeal mucosa. Infections in this space are either restricted locally or spread through the pharynx into the retropharyngeal or parapharyngeal spaces. The peritonsillar space is an area of loose connective tissue between the palatine tonsil and superior constrictor that lies around the palatine tonsil between the pillars of the fauces. Infections in the intratonsillar space usually spread up or down the intrapharyngeal space, or through the pharynx into the parapharyngeal space. The pharyngeal mucosal space contains the mucosa of the nasopharynx, oropharynx and hypopharynx as well as the lymphoid tissue of Waldeyer’s ring, adenoid, palatine tonsils, minor salivary glands, the torus tubarius, pharyngobasilar fascia and the cartilage of the pharyngotympanic tubes.</div><div class="text" id="p0325">Tissue spaces between the layers of cervical fascia are described in <a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355.xhtml">Chapter 35</a> on <a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355.xhtml#pagebreak_578">pages 578</a> and <a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355.xhtml#pagebreak_578">579</a>; tissue spaces around the larynx are described in <a href="../B9780702077050000410/B9780702077050000410.xhtml">Chapter 41</a> on <a href="../B9780702077050000410/B9780702077050000410.xhtml#pagebreak_726">page 726</a>.</div><section><a id="s0320"/><section><a id="s1320"/><h3 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0200">Spread of infection</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0335">Infection that spreads into the parapharyngeal space causes pain and trismus.

Posterior spread from the parapharyngeal space into the retropharyngeal space will produce bulging of the posterior pharyngeal wall, dyspnoea and nuchal rigidity. Involvement of the carotid sheath may cause thrombosis of the internal jugular vein and nerve palsies of the glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory and hypoglossal nerves. If the infection continues to spread unchecked, mediastinitis can ensue. A virulent infection in the retropharyngeal space may spread through the alar fascia into the underlying danger space. Infection in this tissue space may also descend into the thorax and even below the respiratory diaphragm, giving rise to chest and shoulder pain, severe dyspnoea and retrosternal discomfort.</div><div class="text" id="p0340">Pharyngeal infection from mucosa-associated lymph tissues such as the palatine tonsil, or as a result of a penetrating injury (e.g. from an ingested foreign body), can result in the spread of infection into the tissue spaces of the neck adjacent to the pharynx.

Tumours that develop within the prestyloid compartment of the parapharyngeal space most often develop from either ectopic minor salivary tissue, the deep lobe of the parotid gland or in lymph nodes. Those in the post-styloid compartment of the parapharyngeal space are derived from lower cranial nerves in the carotid sheath or vascular tumours arising from the carotid body or the inferior vagal ganglion (<a href="#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_24">Gupta et al 2012</a>). All these tumours, with the exception of those arising in lymph nodes, present late because they grow slowly, produce few symptoms and tend to expand internally rather than externally. Internal expansion and compression of the pharynx often gives rise to a ‘plummy’ quality of the voice and snoring. Those that cause nerve palsies tend to develop slowly, which means that there is time for local accommodation to take place, but also that symptoms can be very subtle initially and overlooked by the patient. Voice change, dysphagia and aspiration becomes more obvious in later stages of the disease.</div><div class="text" id="p0355">Several surgical approaches have been described for the management of parapharyngeal space tumours, including transcervical, transparotid, combined transcervical–transparotid and transoral approaches.

Thyropharyngeus arises from the oblique line of the thyroid lamina, a strip of the lamina behind this, and by a small slip from the inferior cornu. Some additional fibres arise from a tendinous cord that loops over cricothyroid. Cricopharyngeus arises from the side of the cricoid cartilage between the attachment of cricothyroid and the articular facet for the inferior thyroid cornu. Some authors have described cricopharyngeus as consisting of a superficial upper oblique portion – the pars oblique – and a lower, deeper, transverse portion – the pars fundiformis. The upper part attaches to the median raphe while the lower part forms a circular band that lacks a median raphe. The area demarcated by the pars oblique and pars fundiformis of cricopharyngeus is termed Killian’s dehiscence (or Killian’s triangle). A second triangular area, Laimer’s triangle, can be identified beneath cricopharyngeus between the longitudinal fibres of the oesophagus as they pass laterally on either side to attach to the cricoid cartilage; only the circular muscle of the oesophagus forms the wall here. Both triangles are postulated to be sites of weakness in the wall of the pharynx and oesophagus and are therefore areas where diverticula could potentially form. Both cricopharyngeus and thyropharyngeus spread posteromedially to join the contralateral muscle.

The pharyngeal mucosa that lies between cricopharyngeus and thyropharyngeus is relatively unsupported by pharyngeal muscles (the dehiscence of Killian). A delay in the relaxation of cricopharyngeus, which can happen when the swallowing mechanism becomes discoordinated, generates a zone of elevated pressure adjacent to the mucosa in the dehiscence. The result is the development of a pulsion diverticulum (a pouch of prolapsing mucosa), also known as Zenker’s diverticulum, which breaches the thin muscle wall adjacent to the sixth cervical vertebra and expands, usually a little to the left side, into the parapharyngeal potential space. This may trap portions (or all) of the passing food bolus, resulting in regurgitation of old food, aspiration pneumonia, halitosis and weight loss. Treatment may involve open excision or inversion of the pouch to prevent it filling, coupled with division of the circular fibres of cricopharyngeus, to prevent the build-up of pressure in the region and recurrence of the pouch.

It emerges from the upper part of the inferior vagal ganglion and consists of axons arising from neuronal cell bodies in the nucleus ambiguus. The nerve passes between the external and internal carotid arteries to reach the upper border of the middle pharyngeal constrictor and subsequently divides into numerous filaments that contribute to the pharyngeal plexus.

Traditionally described as a reflex, the process is more properly regarded as programmed motor behaviour. Swallowing is initiated when food or liquid stimulates sensory nerves in the oropharynx. In a 24-hour period, an average person swallows between 600 and 1000 times but, of these, only some 150 will relate to feeding; the remainder clear saliva and are less frequent at night (<a href="#bib62" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_62">Sato and Nakashima 2006</a>, <a href="#bib63" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_63">2007</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0635">Eating and drinking are basic human pleasures and problems associated with swallowing can impact dramatically on the quality of life. Swallowing disorders are usually symptoms of other complex diseases; an inability to swallow may adversely affect nutritional status and therefore indirectly exacerbate the underlying disease. Aside from the risk of asphyxiation through choking, swallowing disorders can also be a direct cause of morbidity and mortality as a result of aspiration of food, liquid or possibly refluxed gastric acid contents, causing bacterial infection or tissue damage.</div><div class="text" id="p0640">Swallowing in the adult human has usually been studied in relation to swallowing solid or liquid food carried out on command. For descriptive purposes, the process has been traditionally divided into four phases: oral preparatory, oral transit/transfer, pharyngeal and oesophageal (in this traditional view some have only recognized three phases, combining the two oral phases of preparation and transit into a single oral phase). While this sequence of events may still be appropriate for describing the swallowing of liquids, it is not sufficiently detailed to represent the way in which solid food is prepared for swallowing, where suitably processed food is passed in stages to the oropharynx and valleculae until a swallow is initiated. Oral and pharyngeal stages overlap when swallowing solid food, but perhaps less so when swallowing saliva or other liquids. It is more appropriate to speak of an oral preparatory and an oral transit phase when describing the swallowing of liquids, but inappropriate when considering the swallowing of solid food.

During swallowing, the muscles that dilate the pharyngotympanic tube are activated during a pause in the expiratory phase of respiration. Throughout this first phase, the soft palate is fully lowered by contraction of palatoglossus and palatopharyngeus, and the posterior part of the tongue is simultaneously elevated; the apposed soft palate and tongue form a tight seal that helps to prevent premature leakage of the bolus into the oropharynx before the airways are fully protected. Slight leakage of fluid does sometimes happen; the tendency for there to be leakage because of imperfect sealing increases with age.</div></section><section><a id="s0690"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0460">Oral transit/transfer phase</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0650">In the oral transit/transfer phase, the liquid in the oral cavity is transported through the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches into the oropharynx. Genioglossus raises both the tongue tip and the part of the tongue immediately behind the tip so that they come into contact with the alveolar ridge. Orbicularis oris and buccinator remain contracted, keeping the lips and cheeks taut and the liquid central in the oral cavity. The liquid is accommodated in a shallow midline gutter that forms along the dorsum of the tongue, probably as a result of the co-contraction of the styloglossi and the genioglossi, aided by the superior longitudinal and transverse fibres of the intrinsic muscles. The mandible is elevated and the mouth is closed. The floor of the mouth and the anterior and middle portions of the tongue are elevated by co-contraction of the suprahyoid group of muscles (mylohyoid, digastric, geniohyoid and stylohyoid); the effectiveness of the suprahyoid muscles is increased as they contract against a fixed mandible (the mouth does not have to be closed to swallow, but it is much harder to swallow if it is open). Contraction of stylohyoid elevates the more posterior parts of the tongue and empties the longitudinal gutter. At the same time, the tongue flattens, probably as a result of the contraction of hyoglossus and some of the intrinsic lingual muscles, especially the vertical fibres. The elevated, flattened tongue pushes the liquid against the hard palate, and the sides of the tongue seal against the maxillary alveolar processes, helping to move the liquid further posteriorly. Contraction of styloglossus and mylohyoid completes the elevation of the posterior part of the tongue. At the same time, the posterior oral seal relaxes and the posterior tongue moves forwards; the overall effect is of a cam-like action of the tongue, sweeping or squeezing the liquid towards the pillars of the fauces, finally delivering it to the oropharynx and initiating the pharyngeal stage of swallowing, where the pharyngeal aperture is initially increased and then closed.</div></section><section><a id="s0695"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0465">Oral phases when swallowing solids</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0655">When solid food is swallowed, the process is slightly different from that just described for swallowing liquids. Food is mixed with saliva and reduced to smaller pieces by the processes of chewing. When it has been converted to a suitable consistency to be swallowed, it is transferred to the oropharynx and valleculae, where it can be retained for a few seconds prior to swallowing. During this time, chewing may continue; the bolus is progressively augmented in one or more stages until a swallow is initiated and the pharyngeal phase begins. In this part of the ‘oral phase for solid food’, the essential action is chewing; the mandible is moved by the action of the jaw elevators and depressors, and the food is reduced by the grinding action of the teeth and simultaneously mixed with saliva. The lips are maintained as a tight labial seal by the contraction of orbicularis oris; buccinator performs a similar function for the cheeks. In this way, the sulci are closed, the vestibule normally remains empty, and any food that enters the vestibule is returned to the oral cavity proper. Buccinator keeps the cheeks taut, ensuring that they are kept clear of the occlusal surfaces and that the food remains in place under the occlusal surfaces of the molar teeth. Loss of the nerve supply to buccinator as a result of damage to the facial nerve results in painful and repeated lacerations of the cheeks. It was thought that the soft palate was depressed throughout this phase. It is now recognized that the posterior seal is not tight, and that the oral cavity and oropharynx remain in communication, permitting addition of material to the bolus while chewing continues. Spillage may happen because the soft palate is not in continuous contact with the posterior part of the tongue, as was once thought (<a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Hiiemae and Palmer 1999</a>). Bolus formation appears to involve several cycles of transporting food from the anterior to the posterior part of the tongue through the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches until a bolus accumulates on the oropharyngeal surface of the tongue (retrolingual loading), the valleculae and within the oropharynx. Throughout this phase, the lateral and rotatory tongue movements that deliver the food to the teeth for grinding and reduction are crucial for normal bolus formation because they ensure that the food is positioned under the occlusal surfaces of the teeth. If effective tongue movements are not achieved, chewing will be compromised. Movements of the tongue are also cyclical in phase with the movements of the jaw and hyoid bone. As the jaw is depressed, the tongue is also depressed and moves anteriorly. As the jaw is elevated, the tongue is retracted so that it no longer lies under the anterior teeth as they as are brought together by jaw elevation. These coordinated actions help to ensure that the tongue is not bitten during chewing.</div><div class="text" id="p0660">Chewing continues until all the food has been moved posteriorly, a process that can last from less than 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>second to as much as 10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>seconds. The oral preparatory, oral transport and pharyngeal phases of swallowing therefore overlap when solid food is being swallowed. As pieces of food are prepared in the mouth, they are moved to the posterior part of the tongue or on into the oropharynx in a similar manner to that used to transport liquids. The end of this phase of swallowing is marked by the tongue propelling the prepared bolus of food to the posterior part of the oral cavity and then on into the oropharynx to initiate the swallow. Contact with either the posterior wall of the oropharynx or the mucosa overlying the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches was once thought to be necessary to initiate a swallow; it is now known that there is a great degree of variability in the position of the bolus at the time at which a swallow is initiated.</div></section><section><a id="s0700"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0470">Pharyngeal phase</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0665">The delivery of the bolus to the oropharynx triggers the pharyngeal phase of the swallow. This phase, which is involuntary and is the most critical stage of swallowing, involves the pharynx changing from being an air channel (between the posterior nares and laryngeal inlet) to a food channel (from the fauces to the upper end of the oesophagus). The airway is protected from aspiration during swallowing by hyolaryngeal elevation, and by resetting respiratory rhythm so that airflow ceases briefly as the bolus passes through the hypopharynx; the total time that elapses from the bolus triggering the pharyngeal phase to the re-establishment of the airway is barely 1 second. Thus, there are two aspects of the process to be examined: the transport of the food down the pharynx and through the upper oesophageal sphincter, and the absolute need to protect the airways throughout this time.</div><div class="text" id="p0670">The nasopharynx is sealed off from the oropharynx by activation of the superior pharyngeal constrictor and contraction of a subset of palatopharyngeal fibres to form a variable, ridge-like structure (Passavant’s ridge; <a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Cho et al 2013</a>), against which the soft palate is elevated. From an evolutionary perspective, this ridge represents the remnant of a sphincter that encircled a more highly placed larynx; a high laryngeal position is the norm in other mammals and in the human infant (see below), but not in the human adult. Interestingly, the pharyngeal ridge becomes hypertrophic in an infant with a cleft palate, presumably in an attempt to produce a seal to the nasal airway. Ineffective velopharyngeal closure may result in nasal regurgitation of food.</div><div class="text" id="p0675">The airway is sealed at the laryngeal inlet by closure of the glottis. The epiglottis is retroflexed over the laryngeal aditus as a result of passive pressure from the base of the tongue and active contraction of the aryepiglottic muscles. The conventional view that laryngeal closure during swallowing takes place from inferior to superior, i.e. the vocal folds adduct first and the epiglottis covers the arytenoids and glottis last, has been challenged by studies using simultaneous electromyography and fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). These studies have reported that the aryepiglottic folds close before vocal fold adduction during a swallow. The sequence of events that close the glottis may alter according to the type of swallow and consistency of the bolus (<a href="#bib67" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_67">Steele and Miller 2010</a>). To prevent aspiration of material, irrespective of its consistency, the hyoid bone and larynx are raised and pulled anteriorly with precise timing by the suprahyoid muscles and the longitudinal muscles of the pharynx (<a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">Kendall et al 2001</a>). In this way, the laryngeal inlet is brought forwards under the bulge of the posterior tongue, i.e. out of the path of the bolus. This action helps expand the hypopharyngeal space and relax the upper oesophageal sphincter, which is also raised by several centimetres. The bolus passes over the reflected anterior surface of the epiglottis and is swept through the laryngopharynx to the upper oesophageal sphincter.</div><div class="text" id="p0680">Breathing is suspended briefly during swallowing; the larynx is closed and the soft palate is elevated while there is active neural inhibition of ventilation. Swallowing is normally initiated during an expiration, which is then inhibited during the swallow (typically for a period of 0.5–1.5 <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="715" id="pagebreak_715"/><a id="pg715"/>seconds). Resumption of expiration provides a degree of protection against any residues of solid food that might remain uncleared within the pharynx following the swallow being inhaled into the airway. The bolus is moved by sequential contraction of the pharyngeal constrictor muscles superiorly behind the bolus. At the same time, the pharynx is shortened and elevated as palatoglossus and palatopharyngeus contract against the raised and fixed soft palate. The sequential contraction of the constrictor muscles is often assumed to be the driving force that propels the bolus towards the oesophagus. Evidence that the head of the bolus moves faster than the wave of pharyngeal contraction suggests that, at least in some situations, the kinetic energy imparted to the bolus as it is expelled from the mouth into the oropharynx may be sufficient to carry it through the pharynx. This energy is generated by pressure gradients created within the pharynx by the tongue’s driving force, the hypopharyngeal suction pump, and the ‘stripping action’ of the pharyngeal constrictors (<a href="#bib47" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_47">Nishino et al 1985</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0685">The tongue driving force (tongue thrust pressure force) is a positive pressure that squeezes the bolus towards the laryngopharynx. It is generated by the upward movement of the tongue pressing the bolus against the contracting pharyngeal wall and requires a tight nasopharyngeal seal (created by elevation of the soft palate). There is a view that the tongue driving force is the most important factor responsible for moving the bolus down the pharynx. The hypopharyngeal suction pump is caused by the elevation and anterior movement of the hyoid and larynx. This creates a negative pressure in the laryngopharynx, drawing the bolus towards the oesophagus, aided by a more negative pressure inside the oesophagus. The pharyngeal constrictors generate a positive pressure wave behind the bolus. Their sequential contraction may facilitate clearance (‘stripping’) of the pharyngeal walls and piriform sinuses. Residues that remain in the valleculae reflect inadequate tongue force generation at the end of the oral phase of swallowing.</div><div class="text" id="p0690">At the end of this phase, the bolus is propelled towards the upper oesophageal sphincter. At rest, this sphincter is closed by active contraction. Cricopharyngeus relaxes prior to the bolus arriving and the sphincter is then opened actively by the combined action of the suprahyoid muscles in moving the larynx anteriorly and superiorly, and passively by pressure from the arriving bolus. The upper oesophageal sphincter thus differs in its action from that of other sphincters where opening is generally passive and a consequence of pressures generated by the movements towards them of fluids or solids.</div><section><a id="s0705"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0475">Gag reflex</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0695">Traditionally, the stimulus for triggering a swallow has been regarded as contact with the posterior wall of the pharynx, since this is usually where the gag reflex is triggered (see <a href="../B9780702077050000288/B9780702077050000288.xhtml#pg450">page 450.e1</a>). However, many regions of the oropharynx, when appropriately stimulated by the presence of food or liquid, are capable of triggering a swallow, although some regions are more sensitive than others, e.g. the area over the palatoglossal arches. Moreover, there appears to be little relationship between a functioning gag reflex and the ability to swallow normally because individuals with a reduced or absent gag reflex can swallow safely. Conversely, the presence of a brisk and clear gag reflex is not always associated with the ability to swallow safely.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0710"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0480">Oesophageal phase</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0700">The third, or oesophageal, stage begins after the relaxation of the upper oesophageal sphincter has allowed the bolus to enter the oesophagus. This is a true peristaltic movement, in that a muscular relaxation in front of the bolus and subsequent constriction behind the bolus move it towards the stomach. Sequential waves of contractions of the oesophageal musculature now propel the bolus down to the lower oesophageal sphincter, which opens momentarily to admit the bolus to the stomach. The oesophageal phase of swallowing is much more variable than the other phases and lasts between 8 and 20 seconds.</div></section><section><a id="s0715"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0485">Swallowing pattern generator</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0705">The patterning and timing of striated muscle contraction during swallowing are generated at a brainstem level in a network of neural circuits that collectively form a central swallowing pattern generator. Experimental neurophysiological and tracer studies in animals have shown that the swallowing pattern generator includes several brainstem motor nuclei and two groups of interneurones in the dorsal and ventral medulla: a dorsal swallowing group and a ventral swallowing group. The dorsal swallowing group is located in the nucleus of the solitary tract and possibly in the adjacent reticular formation, and contains neurones that generate the swallowing pattern, probably triggered by convergent information from both cortical and peripheral inputs. The afferent feedback from the branches of the superior laryngeal nerve that innervate the valleculae, epiglottis and supraglottic part of the larynx, and which relay through the nucleus of the solitary tract, facilitates laryngeal closure during swallowing (<a href="#bib33" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_33">Jafari et al 2003</a>). The ventral swallowing group is in the ventrolateral medulla above the nucleus ambiguus and contains neurones that act as ‘switches’, distributing the swallowing drive to motoneurone pools in the trigeminal, facial and hypoglossal nuclei and in the nucleus ambiguus.</div><div class="text" id="p0710">The patterns of activation in the smooth muscle of the lower part of the oesophagus are generated locally in intramural plexuses driven by vagal autonomics.</div><section><a id="s0720"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0490">Supramedullary influence on swallowing</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0715">Techniques including transcranial magnetic stimulation, cortical evoked potentials, positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have all been exploited in the study of volitional swallowing in humans (<a href="#bib68" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_68">Thexton 1998</a>, <a href="#bib69" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_69">Thexton and Crompton 1998</a>, <a href="#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Harris et al 2005</a>). Thus far, these studies have shown that numerous cortical and subcortical regions (primary motor and sensory cortices, operculum, supplementary motor area and cingulate cortex, insula, parietal cortical areas, basal regions and cerebellum) are recruited in swallowing, although, as yet, the functional contributions made by each region have not been established, and it is not known how they influence the swallowing pattern generator. The most consistent cortical activation occurs in the primary motor and somatosensory cortices. Perhaps not surprisingly, the greatest area of fMRI activation in the primary motor cortex occurs over the portion of the precentral gyrus where the face, tongue and pharynx are represented; there is evidence for functional asymmetry between the right and left oral sensorimotor cortices (<a href="#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_41">Martin et al 2004</a>). The activity of the swallowing pattern generator is coordinated with other medullary reflexes, e.g. it is difficult to elicit a swallow when the cortical masticatory centres are stimulated.

In other mammals with an oropharyngeal anatomy similar to that of the human infant, up to 14 cycles of tongue movement or oral phases cause the accumulation of food in this space. Subsequent emptying of the space is a single event followed by movement of the bolus down the oesophagus.

In the neonate, where coordination of suckling, swallowing and breathing is not fully developed, the potential risk of airway obstruction and/or aspiration of ingested milk or other material during swallowing is reduced because the intranarial larynx prevents the bolus from entering the larynx before and after a swallow. (Neonates born at term demonstrate an increase in suck and swallow rates over the course of the first 4 weeks; efficiency of feeding, measured as volume of nutrient per suck and per swallow, doubles over the course of the neonatal period (<a href="#bib57" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_57">Qureshi et al 2002</a>).)</div><div class="text" id="p0735">The change towards adult anatomy and coordination of the phases of swallowing starts a few months after birth (<a href="#bib35" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_35">Kelly et al 2007</a>). Differential growth in length of the human pharynx causes the larynx to take up its low adult position and the epiglottis to lose contact with the soft palate; the larynx reaches its final position around the time of puberty.

Loss of muscle strength affecting tongue propulsion or pharyngeal contraction will impair the initiation of the swallow and/or bolus transport. This will result in retention of residues within the pharynx following a swallow. Residues may also accumulate in the valleculae and piriform sinuses. Failure to protect the airways adequately may result in the penetration of swallowed material food or liquid into the vestibule of the larynx.
