The early arrangement of putative tissues giving rise to cardiovascular and respiratory tissues and their relationship to the intraembryonic coelom is presented. Changes to the pleural cavities and formation of the diaphragm is considered. The cellular lineage of the heart at early and later stages is defined and three-dimensional changes to the heart tube are presented. Septation of the early heart, the formation of the chambers of the heart and fetal circulation, including changes in circulation at birth, is considered. The respiratory tree and the phases of lung development are presented with changes to the lungs at birth and congenital anomaly of distal airways.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">alveolar phase; canalicular phase; costodiaphragmatic recess; ductus arteriosus; embryonic phase; fetal circulation; intrapulmonary vasculature; intra-uterine maturation of lungs; occipital somites; oesophagus; pericardial cavity; pericardioperitoneal canals; pleural cavities; pleuro-peritoneal membrane; postnatal lung development; pseudoglandular phase; respiratory diaphragm; saccular phase; septum transversum; thoracic wall; trachea</div></section>--><section><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Development of the Respiratory Tree</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The development of the respiratory system can be conceptualized as the growth of six intertwined trees: the bronchial tree of conducting airways and terminal gas-exchanging sacs; the systemic arterial and venous trees that perfuse and drain the airways; the pulmonary arterial and venous trees that supply and drain the alveolar membrane, anastomose with the systemic and venous trees, and are pivotal in the provision of blood oxygenation and carbon dioxide excretion after birth; and the lymphatic tree. Development of each tree is related to that of the others and all proceed proximo-distally in terms of growth and expansion. Uniquely, the lungs develop while not fulfilling their postnatal function, but they must function efficiently immediately after birth or the neonate will require respiratory support and may die of respiratory failure.

The specialized respiratory epithelium forms from the endoderm and the other elements of the airway wall are of mesenchymal origin. The future respiratory epithelium bulges ventrally into the investing splanchnopleuric mesenchyme, then grows caudally as a bulb-shaped tube (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Figs 20.1</span></a>–<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">20.2</span></a>; see <a href="../B9780702077050000215/B9780702077050000215.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 21.3</a>). By stage 13 the caudal end of the tube has divided asymmetrically to form the future primary bronchi. The right primary bronchus becomes orientated more caudally as it grows, whereas the left extends more transversely. The trachea is clearly recognizable at stage 14 and from this time the origin of the trachea remains close to its site of evagination from the future oesophagus. Longitudinal growth of the trachea causes the region of the future carina to descend, until ultimately it lies within the thorax.

BMP-4 and fibronectin induce the formation of a cleft between two branches. Branching is promoted by receptor tyrosine kinase and their ligands and by inhibition of FGF10 in mesenchymal MMPs. It is inhibited by Gremlin (a BMP4 antagonist), transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) family members and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) produced in the distal epithelial cells (<a href="#bib85" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_85">Stabile et al 2007</a>).

Tracheal development starts at stage 12 as a ventral outgrowth from the endodermal foregut into the mesenchyme that surrounds the sinus venosus and inflow tract of the heart (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Figs 20.1B–C</span></a>; see <a href="../B9780702077050000215/B9780702077050000215.xhtml#f0020">Figs 21.3</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000215/B9780702077050000215.xhtml#f0030">21.5</a>). The point at which the original respiratory diverticulum buds from the foregut, the laryngotracheal groove, remains at a constant level during the embryonic period, and the trachea lengthens distally as the point of bifurcation descends. The respiratory diverticulum generally becomes surrounded by angiogenic mesenchyme which connects to the developing sixth aortic arch artery and is essential for airway branching. By stage 17 the mesenchyme around the trachea is beginning to condense to form cartilage.</div><div class="text" id="p0030">Initially, the tracheal mesenchyme is continuous with that surrounding the ventral wall of the oesophagus (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 20.2</a>). Progressive lengthening and continued division of the tracheal bud, together with deviation of the lung buds dorsally, isolates the oesophagus and trachea within tissue-specific mesenchyme and facilitates regional differentiation, not only between the trachea and lungs, but also within the lungs themselves, i.e. the number of lobes, or the degree of growth and maturity of a particular lung. Each lung develops by a process of dichotomous branching. For branching to occur, a cleft must develop in the tip (or side) of the epithelial tube, the epithelium then evaginates each side of the cleft, forming new branches that lengthen, and the process is then repeated. The mesenchyme is flattened and densely packed at the tips of the developing epithelial buds, whereas it forms an ordered row of cuboidal cells along the side of the bud and in the clefts. Cells in both arrangements send processes towards the epithelial basal lamina, which is thicker in the clefts but so attenuated as to be almost indistinguishable on the tips of the buds where the epithelium and mesenchymal cells form intimate contacts. Tenascin, an extracellular matrix molecule, is present in the budding and distal tip regions, but absent in the clefts. Conversely, fibronectin, an extracellular matrix molecule found commonly in basal laminae, is found in the clefts and along the sides of the developing bronchi, but not on the budding and distal tips. It is likely that branching morphogenesis is not rigidly pre-specified after the first ‘stereotypical’ generation and adapts to the space available within the mesenchyme (<a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Blanc et al 2012</a>, <a href="#bib54" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_54">Lang et al 2018</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0035">The splanchnopleuric mesenchyme controls the branching pattern of the respiratory tree. Experimental recombination of tracheal mesenchyme with bronchial respiratory endoderm results in inhibition of bronchial branching, whereas recombination of bronchial mesenchyme with tracheal epithelium induces bronchial outgrowths from the trachea. Experimental exposure of rat fetal airway to chick mesenchyme produces a branching pattern typical of a chick airway.</div><div class="text" id="p0040">Smooth muscle and nerves are found outside the airways at this early developmental stage. Airway smooth muscle is innervated and contractile: there is experimental evidence that GDNF (glial derived neurotrophic factor) may play a role in the early innervation of developing airways (<a href="#bib87" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_87">Tollet et al 2002</a>).

The airways act as a template for blood vessel development by <span class="italic">de novo</span> vasculogenesis driven by epithelial-derived VEGF. Development of intra-acinar blood vessels follows the development of the alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs. Vascular development is also complex and has been recently reviewed (<a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_28">Cornett et al 2013</a>, <a href="#bib55" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_55">Lange et al 2014</a>, <a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Bolte et al 2018</a>).

Proliferation of this splanchnopleuric coelomic epithelium, which is especially evident in stage 13 and decreases in stage 14, produces splanchnopleuric mesenchyme that becomes arranged in zones around the developing endoderm. This investing mesenchyme will eventually produce the supporting walls of the conducting airways, differentiating into the mucosal and submucosal laminae propriae (containing fibrocytes that <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="315" id="pagebreak_315"/>synthesize the type I and II collagen, elastin, proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans of the extracellular matrix) and smooth muscle cells.</div><div class="text" id="p0060">Angiogenic mesenchyme is apparent around the primary bronchi at stage 15. It forms an extensive capillary network around each lung bud, receiving blood from the developing sixth aortic arch artery and draining it into an anastomosis connected to the dorsal surface of the left atrium in the mediastinal mesenchyme (<a href="../B9780702077050000136/B9780702077050000136.xhtml">Ch. 13</a>). The pulmonary arteries arise from the sixth aortic arch arteries and the pulmonary veins develop from a solitary channel derived from the dorsal mesocardium that establishes continuity with the vascular plexus formed in the mediastinal mesenchyme. The pulmonary veins become surrounded by myocardium to the level of the second bifurcation; the veins themselves expand and are incorporated into the roof of the left atrium, which means that cardiac muscle is found in the central branches of the pulmonary venous tree (<a href="#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_41">Hislop 2005</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0065">After stage 15 the coelomic epithelium projecting into the pericardioperitoneal canals and covering the lung buds will follow a differentiation pathway to form the visceral pleura.

During this period, virtually the complete branching structure of the future bronchial tree is laid down in 20 generations.</div><div class="text" id="p0075">The growth and branching of the endoderm epithelium is controlled by the local investing splanchnopleuric mesenchyme. The airways begin to differentiate during this stage. Primitive ciliated cells appear at about postfertilization week 7, initially in the region of the membranous trachea, and in the cartilaginous region by postfertilization week 12; ciliogenesis is complete at birth in humans. The proximal airways develop basal cells from postfertilization week 11. Mucous glands develop by postfertilization week 12 and enlarge in the submucosa: secretory activity has been identified in the trachea at postfertilization week 14. The splanchnopleuric mesenchyme condenses around the epithelium, and from stages 16–17 it differentiates into connective tissue cell types and smooth muscle proximal to the tips of the developing airways. Smooth muscle cells are innervated from stage 23. Human tracheal smooth muscle cells have a fluctuating resting membrane potential associated with the spontaneous development of tone and peristalsis-like contractions of the airway of a myogenic nature, probably modified by neuro-humoral factors. Club cells develop in the peripheral airways during the pseudoglandular period and produce a surfactant apoprotein and a10-kDa protein (CC10) with immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activity. Cartilage also develops during this period, and is found in the airways in an adult distribution by postmenstrual week 24. By the end of this period, airway branching and pre-acinar vascular patterns are mature. A normal airway ‘template’ is essential for normal alveolar formation: a degree of pulmonary alveolar hypoplasia is inevitable in conditions characterized by an anomalous airway branching pattern (e.g. both ipsilateral and contralateral to a respiratory diaphragmatic hernia).</div><div class="text" id="p0080">Further endothelial proliferation is seen in the pseudoglandular phase when capillary networks form around the developing lung buds; they will become capillary anastomoses around the future alveoli. The splanchnopleuric mesenchyme differentiates into myointimal cells and the tunica media of the developing blood vessels. Vimentin is expressed in the cells around developing vessels in the pseudoglandular stage, and is replaced by desmin in the saccular phase.</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0045">Canalicular phase (17–27 postmenstrual weeks: formation of respiratory airways and blood–gas barrier thins)</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0085">Two to three generations of branching occur during the canalicular phase, after which the amount of mesenchyme around the branching tips of the dividing respiratory tree decreases and the distal airspaces widen. At 23 postmenstrual weeks, longitudinal histological sections of <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="316" id="pagebreak_316"/><a id="pg316"/>the future distal regions show a sawtooth margin, which may indicate the site of further acini. Peripheral growth is accompanied by an increase in the capillary network around the distal airspace: in many places, the capillaries are in close contact with the respiratory cuboidal epithelium. The primitive endodermal cuboidal epithelial cells, previously the predominant cell in this part of the lung, differentiate into type I epithelial cells (pneumocytes) and type II epithelial cells (pneumocytes) containing lamellar bodies that form the intracellular storage bodies of surfactant. Type II pneumocytes are believed to be the stem cells of the alveolar epithelium. Apposition of the capillary networks to the thin type I pneumocytes and reduction of the interstitial tissue of the lung are prerequisites for future effective gas exchange. By postmenstrual week 24, the histological characteristics of the airways, including cartilage distribution, are the same as in the adult.</div></section><section><a id="s0040"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0050">Saccular/alveolar phase (28 postmenstrual weeks–term: first appearance of alveoli in humans)</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0090">Thin-walled terminal saccules are apparent at the saccular stage and will become alveolar ducts as development proceeds. The expansion of the prospective respiratory airspaces that occurs during this period is accompanied by a further decrease in the amount of mesenchymal interstitial tissue, and the capillary networks become ever more closely opposed to the pneumocyte epithelium. Secondary crests develop from the invaginations of the saccule walls, although this may be an apparent movement when the saccule walls expand each side of a subjacent blood vessel. As an alveolar crest protrudes into a saccule, part of the capillary network becomes drawn into it. After the later expansion of the saccules on each side of the crest, a double capillary layer becomes annexed between what are now alveolar walls. During the saccular stage, elastin is deposited beneath the epithelium (an important step for future alveolar formation), and surfactant production, from type II pneumocytes, matures (essential for the survival of a preterm neonate).</div></section><section><a id="s0045"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0055">Alveolar phase</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0095">An epithelial layer is usually supported by an underlying lamina propria, as in the conducting airways. The mutual support of two epithelial layers, a specialized epithelium and an endothelium, where both contribute to the generation of mutual basal laminal proteins, is very unusual and seen elsewhere only in the kidney glomerular basement membrane and in the brain (see <a href="../B9780702077050000112/B9780702077050000112.xhtml#f0015">Fig. 11.2</a>). This close relationship develops during the alveolar phase between type I pneumocytes and pulmonary endothelium. A number of genes and growth factors are expressed during the formation and maturation of the type I pneumocyte:endothelium interface (alveolar–capillary membrane; blood–gas barrier) and in the final fibrocyte deposition of matrix molecules between developing alveoli. Retinoic acid regulates the expression of a number of growth signalling molecules, homeobox genes and lung epithelial genes. TGF-β, platelet- derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor are involved in the final stages of conducting airway branching. TGFβ is also involved in septal formation and the induction of myofibroblasts which co-localize at ridges signalling the start of alveolar crest development. Myofibroblasts are found later at the tips of alveoli and play a particular role in production of elastin: their failure to produce elastin leads to a lack of alveoli. PDGF also stimulates myofibroblasts: PDGF-null mice fail to form secondary septa. Mechanical stretching of developing lung tissue stimulates human smooth muscle cell differentiation and increases tropoelastin content. Elastin gene expression, possibly modulated through retinoic acid, appears to play a pivotal role.

The formation of millions of alveoli is accomplished by a complex process of folding and division of type I pneumocytes. Mechanical stretch drives type II to type I cell differentiation. The existing walls of the alveoli become thinner as type I pneumocyte cells flatten, forming primitive alveoli. Septa (ridges) initially form where the type I pneumocytes meet subjacent capillaries and myofibroblasts. Subsequent areal expansion of type I pneumocytes, of more than ten times, and increased capillary development, combine to form new alveoli. Mouse embryo studies indicate that each type I pneumocyte may form the walls of multiple adjacent alveoli (<a href="#bib99" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_99">Yang et al 2016</a>). Vessels remain within the developing secondary septa whereas the myofibroblasts are temporary. The process of remodelling of the final capillary network between adjacent alveoli is not yet elucidated, however, it has been noted that type I pneumocytes secrete VEGF (<a href="#bib99" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Yang et al 2016</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0105">The distal airspaces expand during late gestation and continue to do so after birth. The number of alveoli present at birth (variously estimated as between none to 5 x10<sup>7</sup>) is controversial; the number probably increases particularly rapidly over postmenstrual weeks 41–64 (postnatal months 0–6). This process is accompanied by fusion of adjacent capillary networks, so that shortly after birth there is an extensive double capillary net. Fusion of these layers is apparent at postnatal day 28, extensive at 1.5 years and probably complete by 5 years. The alveolar stage is now considered to continue beyond infancy and throughout childhood (whereas heterochronic differences in rat and mouse development show that alveolar formation is exclusively post-natal in these animals).</div></section><section><a id="s0050"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0060">Development of the intrapulmonary vasculature and lymphatics</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0110">Two vascular circulations arise in the developing lungs, bronchial and pulmonary.

The bronchial veins from the periphery of the lungs drain into the pulmonary veins. Postnatally, inflammatory lung conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis cause hypertrophy of the bronchial circulation and these vessels may bleed, sometimes giving rise to massive haemoptysis (<a href="#bib62" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_62">McCullagh et al 2010</a>).

Pulmonary arteries form adjacent to the conducting airways, joining the angiogenic mesenchyme of the sixth aortic arch arteries. Pulmonary veins develop from mediastinal mesenchyme in the dorsal mesocardium and become separated from the airways by the growth of alveoli and lymphatic vessels. By stage 15 a circulation is present from the aortic sac through a branching network of pulmonary arteries into capillary plexuses around the two lung buds, and returning via pulmonary veins to the developing left atrium. As each new distal airway forms in the mesenchyme, a new angiogenic plexus forms as a halo around it, and coalesces with the pulmonary vessel already alongside the proximal airway. In this way, addition of the newly formed tubules to the existing pulmonary vessels is sustained. Vessel formation occurs at least until the end of the pseudoglandular stage and has been shown to be controlled by production of VEGF from type I pneumocytes (<a href="#bib99" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Yang et al 2016</a>). As the arteries increase in size they acquire a muscular wall, initially from the bronchial smooth muscle of the adjacent airway and then from the splanchnopleuric mesenchyme. The muscle layer is thick relative to the lumen, and this in part increases resistance to blood flow. Although only 10% of blood flow goes through the pulmonary circulation during intrauterine life, it is important for normal lung development. By postmenstrual week 20, the structure of the pulmonary vessels is the same as it is in the adult. Vascular innervation follows muscularization; the vasoactive peptides contained in these nerves are predominantly vasoconstrictor.</div><div class="text" id="p0120">As the pulmonary veins enlarge, they become separated from the airways by the lymphatic vessels that lie within the mesenchyme. At around postmenstrual week 12, the peripheral veins develop a single layer of smooth muscle cells in their walls. This layer is derived exclusively from the splanchnopleuric mesenchyme and not from bronchial smooth muscle (as occurs in the arteries). The lumen of each vein is relatively large and the wall is relatively thin at all levels. Arteries and veins continue to develop in the canalicular phase, probably by angiogenesis (dividing cells are seen in the peripheral capillaries). The epithelium of the most peripheral conducting airways flattens when the developing capillaries come to lie immediately subjacent to it.

Surfactant proteins (Sp) B and C are surface active, whereas A and D are part of the collectin family of pattern recognition receptors. Surfactant is crucial for maintaining the functional integrity of alveoli: the main morbidity of extreme prematurity reflects surfactant deficiency causing neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (treatment has been transformed by the availability of exogenous surfactant).

There is evidence that perturbation of fetal lung blood flow also affects lung growth, even though most of the right ventricular output of the heart is shunted away from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus: pulmonary valve stenosis is associated with pulmonary hypoplasia. Although many fetal organs are able to grow to normal proportions even if they are in abnormal locations, this is not the case for the lungs. Lung growth becomes impaired by restricted expansion. Absence or impairment of fetal breathing movements, and defects affecting respiratory diaphragmatic activity, are all associated with pulmonary hypoplasia. Distension of the developing lung may provide a major stimulus to growth during normal development. It is believed that normal fetal breathing movements increase the lung volume and stimulate growth of the distal airspaces. Fetal breathing movements involve rhythmic activation of the respiratory diaphragm and the muscles of the upper respiratory tract. Even though such movements are necessarily very small compared with those seen after birth, because the fetal airways are filled with lung fluid, there is evidence that these phasic movements are important in the release of growth factors. Fetal breathing becomes more prominent in the second and third trimesters, by which time the fetus spends nearly one-third of the time breathing (<a href="#bib37" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_37">Hagen-Ansert 2018</a>). One effect of the absence of fetal breathing movements, for example in severe neuromuscular diseases of antenatal origin such as severe (type I) spinal muscular atrophy and spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress, is pulmonary hypoplasia (<a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_44">Inanlou et al 2005</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0145">During development, the mucous glands of the trachea and bronchi secrete a chloride-rich fluid that usually passes up the respiratory tract to mix with the amniotic fluid secreted by the fetal kidneys. Amniotic fluid volume, pressure and, possibly, content significantly influence lung development by maintaining appropriate lung distension. Renal agenesis, severe congenital urinary obstruction and oligohydramnios (Potter’s syndrome; Potter’s sequence), leads to pulmonary hypoplasia at birth. In renal agenesis, reduced bronchial branching occurs as early as postmenstrual weeks 12–14 (i.e. at a time before amniotic fluid is produced by the metanephric kidneys), which suggests that a direct renal factor supports lung development. Later, the presence of amniotic fluid is necessary for normal fetal lung development. The fetal lung is a net fluid secretor, the output of fluid reaching as high as 5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>ml/kg/hour shortly before birth. Most of the fluid produced within the lungs remains there because of the mechanical effect exerted by amniotic fluid pressure, and normally only a small amount of this fluid contributes to the amniotic fluid. The normal functioning of the kidneys regulates the volume and pressure of the lung airway fluid and may in turn provide the pressure needed for expansion and enlargement of the bronchial and pulmonary systems. Interestingly, obstruction to the fetal airway causes accelerated maturation of alveoli, a finding that has been used therapeutically in congenital diaphragmatic hernia, based on studies showing that intermittent inflation and deflation of an intra-tracheal balloon in a lamb model resulted in better lung growth and maturation (<a href="#bib81" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_81">Ruano et al 2014</a>).

In stage 12 embryos the luminal walls of the pericardioperitoneal canals are separate. The canals are filled with fluid, continuous with that in the extraembryonic coelom which provides a primitive type of circulation up to stage 13, enabling transfer of oxygen and nutrients to the deeper embryonic structures.

The presence and continuing dichotomous growth of the lung buds subdivides the pericardioperitoneal canals into primary pleural coeloms around the lung buds cranially, and paired peritoneal coeloms caudally, contiguous with the wider peritoneal coelom around the mid- and hindguts. The communications with the pericardial and peritoneal coeloms are termed the pleuropericardial and pleuroperitoneal canals, respectively. The descent of the heart as the pharyngeal arches form, together with the changes to the inflow tract of the heart, result in morphological shifts in the relative position of the common cardinal veins that affect the craniocaudal and dorsoventral position of the lung buds. As the lung buds continue to grow and expand, the primary pleural cavities and their cranial and caudal connections become increasingly smaller and eventually separate by different morphological processes.

The cranially placed ridge, containing the common cardinal vein, is now termed the pleuropericardial membrane (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 20.4A</a>). It also contains the elongating phrenic nerve, which reaches the septum transversum by this route. The secondary pleural cavity forms by excavation of the somatopleuric mesenchyme of the body wall (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 20.5</span></a>). The apical part of the lung forms by local invasion and splitting of the body wall cranially on the lateral aspect of the common cardinal vein, which means that the common cardinal vein and the phrenic nerve come to lie medially in the mediastinum. The remaining connection with the pericardial cavity, which lies medial to the vein, is gradually narrowed to a slit and soon obliterated by the apposition and fusion of its margins. Closure occurs early and is mainly effected by the growth and expansion of the surrounding viscera (heart and great vessels, lungs, trachea and oesophagus), and not by active growth of the pleuropericardial membrane across the opening to the root of the lung. As the right common cardinal vein is larger than the left (because of changes to the venous return to the heart; see <a href="../B9780702077050000136/B9780702077050000136.xhtml#f0010">Figs 13.1</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000136/B9780702077050000136.xhtml#f0045">13.8</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000136/B9780702077050000136.xhtml#f0100">13.19</a>), closure occurs first on this side; failure of closure is usually found on the left side.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0025"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000203/main.assets/f20-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0025"/><a id="fspara0025"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 20.5</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, Ventral view of the intraembryonic coelom forming early body cavities. <span class="bold">B</span>, The parietal pericardium is shown surrounding the developing heart ventrally, with the parietal pleura of the lungs dorsal and lateral on each side. <span class="bold">C</span>, A transverse section through the thoracic region, showing the ventral extensions of the pleural sacs on each side of the pericardium that split the body wall mesenchyme. <span class="bold">D</span>, An anterior view of the pleural sacs.

It contains mesenchymal populations from the cephalic pole of the mesonephros as well as the septum transversum. As the lungs expand into the pleural coelom, the ridge grows dorsolaterally to ventromedially across the pleuroperitoneal canal, abutting and fusing with the opposite wall and separating the now complete pleural cavity from the peritoneal cavity. The pleuroperitoneal membrane contributes to the respiratory diaphragm (see below). The right pleuroperitoneal canal closes earlier than the left, which presumably explains why an abnormal communication persisting between the pleural and peritoneal cavities is more frequently encountered on the left. In addition to extension of the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="319" id="pagebreak_319"/><a id="pg319"/>pleural cavities in a cranial direction, the lungs and their associated visceral and parietal pleurae also enlarge ventromedially and dorsocaudally. In the ventromedial extension, the lungs and pleurae excavate and split the somatopleuric mesenchyme covering the pericardium, separating the latter from the ventral and lateral thoracic walls (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 20.5B–D</a>). The ventrolateral fibrous pericardium, parietal serous pericardium and mediastinal parietal pleura, although topographically deep, are therefore somatopleuric in origin. In the caudodorsal extension, the expanding pleural cavities extend into the mesenchyme dorsal to the suprarenal glands, the gonads and (degenerating) mesonephric ridges. The somatopleuric mesenchyme is peeled off the dorsal body wall to form a substantial portion of the dorsolumbar part of the diaphragm (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 20.5C</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0250">Until the end of the embryonic period the shape of the early pleural cavities is determined by the growing lungs. The somatopleuric pleural walls form the parietal (costal, diaphragmatic and mediastinal) pleurae and the splanchnopleuric pleural walls, the visceral pleurae. As the pleural mesothelium differentiates, subpleural tissue is thicker where it is associated with superficial veins, and is generally thicker over the basal areas of the lungs than the apices (<a href="#bib98" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_98">Yamamoto et al 2018</a>). Differentiated mesothelial cells display pinocytotic vesicles and microvilli, at higher density in visceral than parietal pleura, and in caudal than cranial regions. They secrete glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans and phospholipids which contribute to a glycocalyx that is non-adhesive for intracoelomic movements. The parietal pleural mesothelial cells are involved in drainage of pleural liquid to underlying lymphatic channels, via stomata between the mesothelial cells (in a manner similar to the parietal peritoneum). Anomalous development of this drainage route may negatively affect prenatal or perinatal control of pleura fluid volume and lead to congenital chylothorax (<a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Bellini et al 2013</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0125"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0130">Respiratory diaphragm</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0255">The respiratory diaphragm develops as a composite mesenchymal structure that is invaded by myoblast from cervical somites 3–5 (see <a href="../B9780702077050000173/B9780702077050000173.xhtml#f0040">Figs 17.7</a>, <a href="#f0020">20.4</a>). The majority of the early diaphragm is formed from a portion of the septum transversum mesenchyme above the developing liver. The septum transversum is a population of mesenchyme cells that arise from the coelomic wall of the caudal part of the pericardial cavity. As this population proliferates, it forms a condensation of mesenchyme, caudal to the pericardial cavity and extending from the ventral and lateral regions of the body wall to the foregut. The endodermal hepatic bud grows into the caudal part of the septum transversum, whereas the cranial portion forms the respiratory diaphragm (see <a href="../B9780702077050000215/B9780702077050000215.xhtml#f0030">Fig. 21.5</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0260">The oesophagus and developing stomach are dorsal to the septum transversum and the pleuroperitoneal canals are dorsolateral (see <a href="#f0010">Figs 20.1</a>, <a href="#f0020">20.4</a>, <a href="#f0025">20.5</a>). As development proceeds, the lower portion of the oesophagus inclines ventrally, ventral to the descending thoracic aorta. Although the oesophagus has no true ventral or dorsal mesentery within the developing thorax, in descriptions of respiratory diaphragmatic development, the portion of mesenchyme between the oesophagus and aorta at the level of the forming diaphragm is often homologized with part of a dorsal meso-oesophagus.</div><div class="text" id="p0265">The later extension of the pleural cavities ventromedially and dorsolaterally into the somatopleuric mesenchyme of the body wall enlarges the area of the developing respiratory diaphragm, particularly dorsally when the costodiaphragmatic recesses develop. The pleuroperitoneal membranes contribute relatively small bilateral areas to the diaphragm, however, as they are the only portion that closes the connection between the pleural and peritoneal cavities, anomalous development will cause a diaphragmatic hernia.</div><div class="text" id="p0270">After the septum transversum has undergone a progressive change in its relative position, skeletal muscle myoblasts migrate into the respiratory diaphragm from occipital myotomes from about stage 13. The dorsal border of the septum transversum, which initially lies opposite the second cervical segment, migrates caudally as the embryo grows and the heart enlarges. At first the ventral border moves more rapidly than the dorsal, but after the embryo has attained a length of 5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm (about stage 13, 31–33 days post fertilization), the dorsal border migrates more rapidly. When the dorsal border of the septum transversum lies opposite the fourth cervical segment, the phrenic nerve (derived from spinal cord segments C3, C4 and C5) and portions of the corresponding myotomes grow into it and accompany it in its later migrations. The dorsal border of the septum transversum does not come to lie opposite the last thoracic and first lumbar segments, the final position occupied by some of the dorsal attachments of the diaphragm, until the end of the second month. The main derivatives of the central part of the respiratory diaphragm lie at considerably more cranial levels. The cervical myoblasts populate the outer rim of the mesenchymal area and the dorsolateral part which extends caudally behind the developing suprarenal (adrenal) glands. Although histological sections of this region provide clear images of adjacent structures, the curvature of embryos and the difficulty of accurately aligning sectional planes make this developmental process particularly difficult to visualize in 3 dimensions.

The main causes of death in babies with diaphragmatic hernias are pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypoplasia is related to the abnormal branching of the airways both ipsilaterally and contralaterally and the resulting reduced numbers of alveoli. Pulmonary hypertension is related to pulmonary hypoplasia, and to the increased muscularization and reactivity of the pulmonary circulation.

Hypaxial portions of the myotomes at these levels migrate ventrally between stages 14–18, and the spinal nerves follow marginally later.

During stages 15–17, ribs 1–7 are of a similar length and extend half way along the lateral body wall; ribs 8–12 are shorter. In stage 18 the ribs begin to bend ventrally and by stage 20 ribs 1–8 also bend mediocranially towards the putative sternum.

Virtually all the venous return to the right heart is shunted away from the lungs through the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus. Pulmonary vascular resistance is maintained at a very high level by the muscular precapillary pulmonary vessels. At birth, the umbilical cord is tied and cut, and within seconds the lungs must take over all respiratory function in order to maintain life. In the non-compromised full-term neonate, it is advised that cord clamping should be delayed for at least one minute to enhance venous return of blood to the lungs during the first few postnatal breaths.</div><div class="text" id="p0340">With the onset of postnatal breathing the lung must change from secreting fluid to absorbing it. The mechanisms that mediate these dramatic changes are obscure. However, it is clear that the first breath results in pulmonary vasodilatation by at least two mechanisms. First, the mechanical effect of traction on the vasculature: as the chest wall expands, it pulls open the pulmonary vessels. Second, oxygen entering the lungs for the first time produces pulmonary vasodilatation. The demonstration that pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) falls, even if an experimental animal fetus is delivered into an atmosphere of pure nitrogen, implies that other mediators, including cyclo-oxygenase metabolites, are important. The gene for cyclo-oxygenase 1 (but not 2) in endothelium and vascular smooth muscle shows enhanced expression in late fetal and early post-natal life. Endothelin receptor expression increases around the time of birth, implying a role for this system in postnatal adaptation. The role of nitric oxide in postnatal adaptation is controversial, and there are likely to be important species differences. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is more abundant in young compared with mature animals, and smooth muscle sensitivity to nitric oxide may be greater at birth than in older animals.

The fetal shunts (foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus) reopen and right to left shunting causes profound hypoxaemia, ‘persistent fetal circulation’. At full-term delivery the lung volume is small but related to body weight. All airways are present and differentiated (cartilage, glands, muscle, nerves) with one-third to one-half of the adult complement of alveoli present, giving sufficient surface area for gas exchange.</div></section><section><a id="s0165"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0165">Lungs at birth in preterm infants</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0355">There appears to be a relationship between those organs with specialized epithelia abutting endothelium with fused basal laminae and their sensitivity to damage by prematurity and haemodynamic shifts (see <a href="../B9780702077050000112/B9780702077050000112.xhtml#f0015">Fig 11.2</a>). The alveolar–capillary membrane, the glomerular basement membrane and the blood–brain barrier are specifically affected by preterm birth, where changes in oxygen tension and blood pressure can change the normal developmental trajectory, and any one of these sites is affected by changes in the others. These sites are also particularly affected by postnatal haemodynamic shifts within the still embryonic blood vessels, such that either the tissue becomes more hypoxic than the fetal environment, or hyperoxic when cardiac shunts change postnatally. Either change can cause damage, resulting in acute inflammation and healing, with cytokines entering the fetal circulation and affecting other vulnerable developing organs.</div><div class="text" id="p0360">Extremely premature babies, who are treated with surfactant and ventilated using low-pressure, high-rate strategies, show arrest of alveolar development and pulmonary hypoplasia. Arrest of development is also seen in outer cortical glomeruli and in the migration of neuroblasts and glioblasts to the cortical plate in preterm infants. However, in the kidney and brain the connection between the specialized epithelia and adjacent endothelium is stable in some mature areas, for example, the glomerular basement membrane in the kidney functions prenatally and does not undergo significant mechanical change at birth. In contrast, lung alveoli and pulmonary capillaries expand during the first postnatal breaths, initiating postnatal maturation of ventilation perfusion matching. In the preterm infant the initial extent of lung expansion is crucial. As few as three large assisted ventilatory breaths may cause sufficient damage to the expanding alveolar type I pneumocytes and associated pulmonary alveolar capillaries to initiate an inflammatory response and cytokine release triggering a systemic inflammatory response (<a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_1">Barton et al 2015</a>). Ventilation-induced lung injury contributes to subsequent healing processes and leads to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (also known as chronic lung disease). Impaired haemodynamic autoregulation effects the cerebral blood flow and leads to either hypoxia/ischaemia or cerebral haemorrhage, and affects the permeability of the blood–brain barrier (<a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Barton et al 2015</a>, <a href="#bib91" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_91">Volpe 2017</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0365">Preterm males may have worse respiratory distress than females after control for other risk factors, such as degree of prematurity; it is possible that in male fetuses surfactant production is delayed (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Anadkat et al 2012</a>, <a href="#bib45" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_45">Jackson 2018</a>). Androgens delay fetal lung maturation while stimulating fetal lung growth: type II cells in males are less mature than in females during the canalicular phase.</div><div class="text" id="p0370">More than half of preterm infants develop respiratory distress syndrome due to lung immaturity and surfactant deficiency. Shear stress in the alveoli and terminal bronchi, caused by repetitive reopening of collapsed alveoli and overdistention of open alveoli, leads to type I pneumocyte damage and protein exudate into the alveoli and terminal airways (this is the basis of hyaline membranes). The exudate may impair the function of the limited surfactant that is present in immature lungs. Reopening collapsed alveoli requires the generation of highly negative intrathoracic pressure, thus the preterm infant shows retractions of the thoracic wall and use of accessory muscles during inspiration. Expiratory grunting, caused by partial closure of the glottis, helps maintain end-expiratory pressure and patency of unstable alveoli (<a href="#bib45" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Jackson 2018</a>). Hyperoxia or dexamethasone treatment of experimental rats during the alveolarization period permanently abrogates alveolar development, suggesting that iatrogenic damage to the developing alveoli when ventilating a preterm baby with oxygen-enriched mixtures is probably irreversible, and ventilation-induced lung injury may now be the basis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<a href="#bib92" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_92">Voynow 2017</a>). The long-term effects of preterm birth and its treatment are changing over the years. Survivors from the pre-surfactant era have disease dominated by airflow obstruction. Importantly even babies born at 33–34 postmenstrual weeks have persistent postnatal airflow obstruction (<a href="#bib52" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_52">Kotecha et al 2012</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0170"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0170">Neonatal thorax</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0375">In the normal full-term neonate, the trachea is relatively small in relation to the larynx. The walls of the trachea are relatively thick and the tracheal cartilages are relatively closer than they are in the adult. The trachea begins level with the upper border of the sixth cervical vertebra, a relationship that is conserved with growth, and it bifurcates at the level of the third or fourth thoracic vertebra.</div><div class="text" id="p0380">A number of differences between the neonatal and adult thorax and respiratory diaphragm are significant in early postnatal life, especially in the preterm infant. The full-term neonatal thorax has a rounded circumference whereas the adult profile is dorsoventrally flattened. The compliance of the adult chest wall and lung are approximately equal, but the neonatal chest wall is up to five times more compliant than the lungs and so is easily deformable: indrawing of the chest wall is an important sign of increased work of breathing in the neonate. The respiratory diaphragm is relatively flat at birth and gains its dome shape as the thorax and abdominal viscera grow. The arrangement of the ribs and diaphragm in the neonate means that contraction of the diaphragm pulls the compliant ribs inwards. This does not contribute to inspiration and leads to chest distortion: it may be opposed by the stabilizing action of the expiratory muscles. The neonatal respiratory diaphragm exhibits an exaggerated asymmetric movement: the posterior portion shows a considerably greater excursion than the anterior portion.</div><div class="text" id="p0385">A neonate undertakes relatively greater work in order to breathe, and is much more vulnerable to developing respiratory muscle fatigue and respiratory muscle failure than an adult. Experimental animal studies suggest that neonates may be especially vulnerable to respiratory muscle failure because of the initial immaturity of synapses. Moreover, myosin isoforms are developmentally regulated in the diaphragm, and the reduced power output and work performance of the neonatal diaphragm may reflect these molecular differences. In expiration, there may be active braking of airflow, caused by inspiratory muscle activity and partial constriction of the larynx.</div><div class="text" id="p0390">At all ages, there is a reduction, if not loss, of tonic intercostal activity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The mechanism is believed to be related to a descending spinal inhibition of the muscle spindle system. In addition, although during REM sleep the respiratory diaphragm descends further, this inspiratory effort is dissipated in sucking in the ribs and enlarging the abdomen, such that the rib cage and abdominal ventilatory movements become out of phase. The neonate is at particular risk in this respect, because the chest wall is flexible, and much of the infant sleep activity is of the REM type. Furthermore, the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="322" id="pagebreak_322"/><a id="pg322"/>upper airway musculature may lose tone during REM sleep, so that the soft tissues of the pharynx are sucked in during inspiration, limiting the cross-sectional area of the upper airway and further increasing the work of breathing.</div><section><a id="s0175"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0175">Endotracheal intubation in the neonate</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0395">The insertion of an endotracheal tube is a procedure that may be required for resuscitation of the neonate at birth and subsequently to enable artificial ventilation. The larynx is more funnel-shaped than in the adult. It is located at the level of the middle of the body of the third cervical vertebra in preterm infants, and at the interspace between the third and fourth cervical vertebrae in full-term infants (<a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Fiadjoe et al 2018</a>). Visualization of the infant larynx is difficult because, unlike the adult, the angle between the plane of the tongue and the plane of the glottic opening is more acute; the epiglottis is omega-shaped and narrow and angled away from the axis of the trachea; and the vocal cords are angled with a higher attachment ventrally than dorsally. The cricoid cartilage is functionally the narrowest portion of the upper airway in infants.</div><div class="text" id="p0400">An endotracheal tube is introduced, usually orally initially, and guided through the vocal cords under direct vision using a laryngoscope. The length of the trachea (vocal cords to carina) in full-term neonates and infants to 1 year of age varies from 5 to 9<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm.

It was thought that most of the alveoli were formed by two years of age, with subsequent lung growth primarily resulting from an increase in the size of individual alveoli. However, measurements of alveolar size throughout childhood and adolescence using hyperpolarized helium have shown that neo-alveolarization as well as an increase in alveolar size continues through childhood and adolescence (<a href="#bib71" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_71">Narayanan et al 2012</a>). This has important implications for diseases characterized by neonatal arrest of alveolarization, for example after ventilation of the extreme preterm baby there is more scope for recovery than previously thought, but also more potential harm from childhood perturbations.

Thereafter, the change in lung size again proceeds in a linear fashion. High resolution CT scanning has been used to measure airway dimensions (<a href="#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">de Jong et al 2006</a>), although this technique should be used with caution because of the radiation exposure.</div><div class="text" id="p0430">There is little in the way of structural data to set alongside epidemiology.
