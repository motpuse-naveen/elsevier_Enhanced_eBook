It is continuous medially and inferiorly with the postcentral gyrus along connections that encircle both extremities of the central sulcus. The inferior connection corresponds to the subcentral gyrus, delineated anteriorly and posteriorly by the anterior and posterior subcentral rami of the lateral fissure. They can be situated either completely over the lateral fissure, or in part internal to the fissure. The superior connection corresponds to the paracentral lobule that is located on the medial surface of the hemisphere inside the interhemispheric fissure, and delineated anteriorly by the paracentral sulcus and posteriorly by the ascending marginal ramus of the cingulate sulcus.

Usually the superior frontal gyrus is subdivided by an intermediate frontal sulcus into a lateral and a medial portion. The middle frontal gyrus is usually the largest of the frontal gyri, and is frequently connected posteriorly to the precentral gyrus. It harbours a complex of multiple shallow sulcal segments known collectively as the middle or intermediate frontal sulcus (<a href="../B978070207705000032X/B978070207705000032X_bib.xhtml#bib124" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Petrides and Pandya 2012</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1160">The inferior frontal gyrus is subdivided by small sulci into a posterior pars opercularis, an intermediate pars triangularis and an anterior pars orbitalis (see <a href="../B978070207705000032X/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0275">Fig. 32.47</a>). The opercular part is rostrally bordered by the ascending ramus of the lateral fissure, and posteriorly by the precentral sulcus. A diagonal sulcus is occasionally visible in the pars triangularis.

It underlies the olfactory tract and bulb. Posteriorly, the olfactory tract is divided into medial and lateral striae that delineate the most anterior aspect of the anterior perforated substance. The narrow gyrus rectus, medial to the olfactory sulcus, is considered to be the most anatomically constant of the cerebral gyri. The orbital gyri, lateral to the olfactory sulcus, account for the greatest proportion of the frontobasal region. The orbital gyri are delineated by the lateral, medial and transverse orbital sulci that together form a characteristic H shape.

The anterior part of the ventral lateral nucleus projects to the premotor and supplementary motor areas of the cortex. Other thalamic connections of BA4 are with the centromedian and parafascicular thalamic nuclei. Apart from the corticospinal tract and thalamic projections, the motor cortex has extensive subcortical connections with the striatum, subthalamic nucleus, pontine nuclei and all the somatomotor nuclei in the brainstem (oculogyric, facial and hypoglossal nuclei).</div><div class="text" id="p1205">BA4 is the origin of polysynaptic descending pathways to the spinal cord that relay in the reticular formation, red nucleus, superior colliculus, vestibular nuclei and inferior olivary nucleus. BA4 is also connected with the ipsilateral somatosensory cortex through short U-fibres, which are topographically organized according to the homuncular principle, i.e. the largest projections are observed for the hand and there are progressively smaller projections for the tongue/mouth and foot areas (<a href="../B978070207705000032X/B978070207705000032X_bib.xhtml#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Catani et al 2012</a>). These projections to the motor cortex arise mainly in BA1 and BA2, with minor contribution from area 3b. Fibres from the somatosensory cortex terminate in layers II and III of BA4: neurones in the motor cortex that can be activated from the somatosensory cortex tend to have a late onset of activity, mainly during the execution of movement. Connections between motor and somatosensory homunculi may play a role in precision grasping and motor learning. Additional ipsilateral corticocortical fibres to BA4 posterior to the central sulcus come from the opercular part of the somatosensory area (SII). Neurones in BA4 are responsive to peripheral stimuli and have receptive fields similar to those in the primary somatosensory cortex. Cells located posteriorly in the motor cortex (area 4p) have cutaneous receptive fields, whereas more anteriorly situated neurones (in area 4a) respond to stimulation of deeper tissues (<a href="../B978070207705000032X/B978070207705000032X_bib.xhtml#bib64" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Geyer et al 1996</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1210">The motor cortex receives inputs from the lateral premotor cortex, supplementary motor area and insula.

Subcortical projections to the striatum and pontine nuclei are prominent, and it projects to the superior colliculus and the reticular formation. Commissural connections are with the contralateral premotor, primary motor and superior parietal (BA5) cortices. Ipsilateral corticocortical connections with BA5 are common to both dorsal and ventral subdivisions of the premotor cortex, and both send a major projection to the primary motor cortex. The dorsal premotor area receives fibres from the posterior superior temporal cortex and projects to the supplementary motor cortex. The dorsal subdivision of the lateral premotor area receives projections from the frontal eye field. Perhaps the greatest functionally significant difference in connectivity between the dorsal and ventral subdivisions of the lateral premotor area is that the dorsal premotor area receives fibres from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas the ventral subdivision receives fibres from the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. All of these association connections are reciprocal.</div><div class="text" id="p1230">Direction selectivity for movement is a common feature of many premotor neurones. Neurones in the dorsal premotor cortex show anticipatory activity and task-related discharge as well as direction selectivity, but little or no direct stimulus-related activity. Together with the posterior parietal cortex, the dorsal premotor cortex is important in establishing a motor programme or intention, thus contributing to motor preparation in relation to internally guided movement. In contrast, the ventral premotor cortex is related more to the execution of externally guided movements in relation to a specific stimulus, especially visually guided movements.</div><div class="text" id="p1235">The supplementary motor area (SMA proper) is found within the medial portion of BA6 (see <a href="../B978070207705000032X/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0295">Fig. 32.52A</a>). An additional functional subdivision, the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), lies anterior to the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the cortex. The portion of area 24 buried in the cingulate sulcus and adjacent to BA6 contains two motor areas, the anterior and posterior cingulate motor areas (see <a href="../B978070207705000032X/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0295">Fig. 32.52</a>). SMA proper and pre-SMA are ‘agranular’ cortices, because a layer IV is not clearly definable in Nissl stained sections of this area (see <a href="../B978070207705000032X/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0295">Fig. 32.52B</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1240">SMA receives its major thalamic input from the anterior part of the ventral lateral thalamic nucleus, which in turn is the major recipient of input from the internal segment of the globus pallidus. Additional thalamic afferents are from the ventral anterior nucleus, intralaminar nuclei (notably the centrolateral and centromedial nuclei) and the mediodorsal nucleus. The connections with the thalamus are reciprocal. SMA makes a substantial contribution to the corticospinal tract. It contains a homuncular representation of the body in which the leg is posterior, the face anterior and the upper limb is represented between them. Its role in the control of movement is primarily in complex tasks that require temporal organization of sequential movements and in the retrieval of motor memory. Stimulation of SMA elicits the sensation of an urge to move, or of anticipation that a movement is about to occur.</div><div class="text" id="p1245">Pre-SMA receives connections from widespread regions of the ipsilateral frontal lobe, including the primary motor cortex, dorsal premotor area, dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal, medial prefrontal, fronto-orbital cortices and the frontal eye field. These connections are reciprocal, but the major ipsilateral efferent pathway is to the motor cortex. Parietal lobe connections of pre-SMA are with the superior parietal area BA5 and inferior parietal lobule. Contralateral connections are with SMA and contralateral premotor cortices. Further subcortical connections pass to the striatum, subthalamic and pontine nuclei, the brainstem reticular formation and the inferior olivary nucleus.</div><div class="text" id="p1250">The frontal eye field (FEF) is an important area for the control of eye movements. It is located near the junction of the middle frontal and precentral sulci: activation studies in humans indicate a more posterior localization (BA6) compared to monkeys (BA8). It receives its major thalamic projection from the parvocellular mediodorsal nucleus, with additional afferents from the medial pulvinar, ventral anterior nucleus, suprageniculate–limitans complex and the paracentral nucleus of the intralaminar group. The thalamocortical pathways to FEF are part of pathways from the superior colliculus, substantia nigra and the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. The FEF has extensive ipsilateral corticocortical connections, and receives input from several visual areas in the occipital, parietal and temporal lobes, including the middle temporal area (V5). There are also projections from the auditory superior temporal gyrus and the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. The FEF projects to the dorsal and ventral premotor cortices and to a medial motor area, probably the supplementary eye field adjacent to the supplementary motor area proper. The FEF projects prominently to the superior colliculus, the pontine gaze centre within the pontine reticular formation, and oculogyric-related nuclei in the brainstem.</div><div class="text" id="p1255">The prefrontal cortex on the dorsolateral surface of the hemisphere consists predominantly of Brodmann’s areas 8, 9, 10, 46, 47 and language areas 44 and 45.

Within the frontal lobe, BA10 has connections with BA32, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and premotor areas on the medial surface of the hemisphere.

Fo3 is bordered medially by Fo1 and Fo2. The posterior part of the fronto-orbital cortex extends to the olfactory and insular cortices and is partly covered by the temporal lobe. The parolfactory sulcus often marks the border between the medial part of the fronto-orbital cortex and BA25. The medial fronto-orbital cortex has reciprocal connections with various limbic structures including the anterior cingulate, insula, amygdala and entorhinal cortices, hippocampus, diagonal band of Broca, midline thalamic nuclei and the magnocellular sector of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. The fronto-orbital cortex is involved in a variety of functions associated with pleasant as well as painful perceptions and reward processing (see limbic lobe).

Both areas are involved in speech production and show considerable inter-individual variability in size and relationship to gyri. Volumes of left BA44 are always larger than those of the right hemisphere. Thus, interhemispheric differences in the volume of BA44 may be interpreted as anatomical correlates of language dominance. Volumes of BA45 do not differ significantly between the hemispheres. BA44 is involved more in syntactic processes, and BA45 more in semantic processes. The borders between these areas are not consistently defined by sulcal landmarks (<a href="../B978070207705000032X/B978070207705000032X_bib.xhtml#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Amunts et al 1999</a>). BA47, or at least its most posterior part, should also be considered as part of the Broca region for functional reasons.

The inferior boundary is defined by the lateral fissure and its imaginary prolongation to the line connecting the parieto-occipital sulcus and the occipito-temporal incisure.</div><div class="text" id="p1300">The lateral aspect of the parietal lobe is divided into three regions by the postcentral and intraparietal sulci. The intraparietal sulcus, which originates from around the midpoint of the postcentral sulcus, is prominent on the superolateral surface of the parietal lobe, running parallel with the superior margin of the hemisphere (see <a href="../B978070207705000032X/B978070207705000032X.xhtml#f0120">Figs 32.2</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000032X/B978070207705000032X.xhtml#f0125">32.3</a>). Anteriorly, the intraparietal sulcus is usually continuous with the inferior portion of the postcentral sulcus and posteriorly it passes into the occipital lobe as the superior occipital sulcus, which continues posteriorly into the transverse occipital sulcus. The intraparietal sulcus delineates the superior parietal lobule, continuous medially with the precuneus, and the inferior parietal lobule, made up of the supramarginal and angular gyri and a more posterior convolution continuous with the occipital lobe. The superior vertical branch of the intraparietal sulcus (transverse parietal sulcus) divides the SPL into an anterior and posterior portion, whereas the inferior vertical branch (intermediate sulcus of Jensen) separates the supramarginal gyrus anteriorly from the angular gyrus posteriorly. The inferior aspect of the supramarginal gyrus within the inferior parietal lobule of the dominant hemisphere corresponds to Wernicke’s area, which extends along the posterior aspect of the superior temporal gyrus.</div><div class="text" id="p1305">The postcentral gyrus is usually narrower than the precentral gyrus. Both gyri are located obliquely on the superolateral surface of the hemisphere, just superior to the lateral fissure. The superior portions of the pre- and postcentral gyri, which constitute the paracentral lobule on the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere, are topographically related to the ventricular atrium, situated posterior to the thalamus. The inferior portions of both gyri cover the posterior half of the insula and are topographically related to the body of the lateral ventricle, situated superior to the thalamus. The portion of the subcentral gyrus corresponding to the base of the postcentral gyrus consistently lies over the transverse gyri of Heschl, situated on the opercular surface of the temporal lobe.</div><div class="text" id="p1310">The supramarginal gyrus surrounds the distal portion of the lateral fissure (its posterior ascending branch) and becomes continuous with the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus. Above the distal end of the lateral fissure, the supramarginal gyrus is connected anteriorly to the postcentral gyrus through a fold that runs underneath the inferior aspect of the postcentral sulcus. Posteriorly, it occasionally rounds the inferior extremity of the intermediate sulcus and connects to the angular gyrus. The angular gyrus is a curved gyrus and always surrounds one of the distal segments of the superior temporal sulcus, usually the middle one (angular sulcus or t2 in <a href="../B978070207705000032X/B978070207705000032X.xhtml#f0120">Fig. 32.2H</a>); its most inferior portion is continuous with the middle temporal gyrus.

The most inferior caudal branch (t3) of the superior temporal sulcus is less evident and less constant.

Inferior to the subparietal sulcus, the precuneus is connected to the isthmus of the cingulate gyrus, which is continuous with the parahippocampal gyrus.

Area 3a lies in the depth of the central sulcus and is contiguous to area 4p whereas area 3b is in the posterior wall of the central sulcus. BA1 is on the crown of the postcentral gyrus, and BA2 occupies its posterior cortex (see <a href="../B978070207705000032X/B978070207705000032X.xhtml#f0035">Fig. 32.13</a>).

In contrast, area 3b has a very high cell packing density in the supragranular layers, particularly layer IV, and the cells in layer III are homogeneously distributed: this led to the classification of area 3b as koniocortical (see <a href="../B978070207705000032X/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0285">Fig. 32.50E</a>).

The face, tongue and lips are represented inferiorly, the trunk and upper limb are represented on the superolateral aspect, and the lower limb is represented on the medial aspect of the hemisphere. The function of SI depends on its thalamic input from the ventral posterior nucleus. This nucleus is divided into a ventral posterolateral part, which receives information from the trunk and limbs, and a ventral posteromedial part, in which the head is represented. Within the ventral posterior nucleus, neurones in the central core respond to cutaneous stimuli and those in the most dorsal anterior and posterior parts, which arch as a ‘shell’ over the central core, respond to deep stimuli. This is reflected in their differential projections to the cortex: the cutaneous central core projects to 3b, the deep tissue-responsive neurones send fibres to areas 3a and 2, and an intervening zone projects to area 1. Within the ventral posterior nucleus, anteroposterior rods of cells respond with similar modality and somatotopic properties. They appear to project to restricted focal patches in the primary somatosensory cortex of approximately 0.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm width.

Short U-fibres connect the primary somatosensory areas with ipsilateral BA4 and parietal areas in the superior and inferior parietal lobule, and the parietal operculum. The primary somatosensory cortex has reciprocal commissural connections with its contralateral homologue, except that the cortices containing the representation of the distal extremities are relatively devoid of such connections. Callosal fibres in the primary somatosensory areas arise mainly from the deep part of layer III and terminate in layers I–IV.

Other projections from layer V of the primary somatosensory cortex terminate in the main pontine nuclei, the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (pontine tegmental reticular nucleus) and the spinal cord.

The parietal opercular areas are characterized by a columnar arrangement. While OP1 has a pronounced superficial-to-deep increase in cell size in layer III, area OP2 appears more homogeneous, but with additional very large pyramidal cells in deep layer III. In area OP3, layer III, V and VI have considerably lower cell packing densities. Area OP4 is characterized by smaller cells throughout, with only medium-sized pyramids in deep layer III, and layer IV is difficult to visualize. The secondary somatosensory region lies along the upper bank of the lateral fissure, posterior to the central sulcus. It contains a somatotopic representation of the body, with the head and face most anterior, adjacent to SI, and the sacral regions most posterior. The secondary somatosensory region is reciprocally connected with the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus in a topographically organized fashion. Some thalamic neurones probably project to both primary and secondary somatosensory regions via axon collaterals. Other thalamic connections of the secondary somatosensory region are with the posterior group of nuclei and with the intralaminar central lateral nucleus. The secondary somatosensory region also projects to laminae IV–VII of the dorsal horn of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord, the dorsal column nuclei, the principal trigeminal nucleus and the periaqueductal grey matter of the midbrain. Within the cortex, SII is reciprocally connected with SI in a topographically organized manner and projects to the primary motor cortex. SII also projects in a topographically organized way to the lateral part of PPC, and makes connections with PCC. Both right and left SII areas are interconnected across the corpus callosum, although distal limb representations are probably excluded. Neurones in SII respond particularly to transient cutaneous stimuli, e.g. brush strokes or tapping, which are characteristic of the responses of Pacinian corpuscles in the periphery: they show little response to maintained stimuli.</div><div class="text" id="p1355">The superior and inferior parietal lobules are each composed of seven cytoarchitectonically distinct areas (<a href="../B978070207705000032X/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0310"><span class="bold">Fig. 32.55</span></a>).

On the medial surface, the occipital lobe is limited anteriorly by the parieto-occipital sulcus and by its prolongation towards the tentorium cerebelli. Along the inferior cerebral surface, the base of the occipital lobe is continuous with the base of the temporal lobe. The sulci and gyri of the occipital lobe, especially of its superolateral surface, exhibit a greater degree of anatomical variation than is seen in the other lobes. Regarding the major named sulci, there appears to be reasonable consensus that the parieto-occipital, calcarine, paracalcarine, lingual, transverse occipital, inferior lateral occipital and anterior occipital sulci, together with the occipital parts of the collateral and lateral occipitotemporal sulci, are constant features of the surface of the occipital lobe, whereas the superior occipital, superior lateral occipital, inferior occipital, lunate and occipitopolar sulci are less constant.</div><section><a id="s0235"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0225">Occipital lobe sulci and gyri</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1400">There are two or three gyri (superior, middle and inferior) on the superolateral cerebral surface of the occipital lobe that converge posteriorly to form the occipital pole (see <a href="../B978070207705000032X/B978070207705000032X.xhtml#f0120">Figs 32.2</a>–<a href="../B978070207705000032X/B978070207705000032X.xhtml#f0125">32.3</a>). The superior occipital gyrus is always well defined, and is continuous along the superomedial margin of the hemisphere with the cuneus. Superiorly, it is delimited by the depth of the parieto-occipital fissure on the superolateral hemispheric surface. It is continuous with the SPL through the parieto-occipital ‘pli de passage’ of Gratiolet. Laterally, the superior occipital gyrus may be delimited by either the intra-occipital, transverse occipital or superior occipital sulci. The inferior occipital gyrus lies horizontally along the inferolateral margin of the hemisphere. Anteriorly, it is usually continuous with the inferior temporal gyrus; posteriorly, it can extend medially around the occipital pole, becoming continuous with the lingual gyrus on the medial surface of the hemisphere; superiorly, it is delimited by the lateral or inferior occipital sulcus. The superior lateral occipital sulcus is a horizontal sulcus. Anteriorly, it is frequently connected to the inferior temporal sulcus; inferiorly, it may be accompanied by a shorter inferior lateral occipital sulcus. Both of these sulci may be connected with a sulcal complex known as the anterior occipital sulcus, which, when present, lies along the anterior aspect of the middle occipital gyrus.</div><div class="text" id="p1405">The intraparietal sulcus extends longitudinally and inferiorly into the occipital lobe, where it becomes the intra-occipital sulcus. The latter may occasionally descend to the occipital pole but it usually terminates on reaching the transverse occipital sulcus, dividing it into lateral and medial parts that penetrate the superior occipital gyrus. The lunate sulcus, although conspicuous in monkeys and apes, is only sometimes identifiable in human brains, when it appears as a well-defined vertical and backward-curved sulcus anterior to the occipital pole.</div><div class="text" id="p1410">Despite significant anatomical variation, the superolateral occipital convolutions are connected to the parietal and temporal convolutions by consistent cortical folds. Four folds connect the parietal and temporal lobes with the occipital lobe: the superior parieto-occipital fold (parieto-occipital arcus) connects the SPL with the superior occipital gyrus; the inferior parieto-occipital fold, a posterior extension of the angular gyrus, connects with the middle occipital gyrus and occasionally also with the superior occipital gyrus; the first temporo-occipital fold is the continuation of the middle temporal gyrus with the inferior occipital gyrus; and the second temporo-occipital fold is the continuation of the inferior temporal gyrus with the inferior occipital gyrus.</div><div class="text" id="p1415">The medial surface of the occipital lobe is separated from the parietal lobe by the parieto-occipital sulcus and dominated by the calcarine sulcus. The dorsal part of this region, above the calcarine sulcus and posterior to the parieto-occipital sulcus, is the cuneus. The ventral part of this region, lying below the calcarine sulcus and extending as far as the occipital extension of the collateral fissure, is the lingual gyrus. The calcarine sulcus starts anteriorly beneath the splenium of the corpus callosum, delineating the inferior aspect of the isthmus of the cingulate gyrus, and runs posteriorly just above the inferomedial margin of the hemisphere. The parieto-occipital sulcus separates the cuneus from the precuneus, and divides the calcarine sulcus into an anterior and a posterior part. The parieto-occipital and calcarine sulci appear continuous on the surface, but when their borders are retracted it becomes obvious that they are separated by one or more small gyri. The anterior part of the calcarine sulcus is classified as a complete sulcus because its depth creates an elevation (calcar avis) in the medial wall of the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle. The posterior part of the calcarine sulcus is considered an axial sulcus, given that its axis runs along the visual cortex. Only the posterior part includes the primary visual cortical areas, which are located on its superior (cuneal) and inferior (lingual) surfaces: this part of the calcarine sulcus frequently harbours the cuneolingual gyrus that links both gyri.</div><div class="text" id="p1420">At the level of the occipital pole, the calcarine sulcus usually branches in a T or Y shape as the retrocalcarine sulcus. The gyrus descendens of Ecker lies posterior to and along the retrocalcarine sulcus and is occasionally bounded posteriorly by the occipitopolar sulcus. The retrocalcarine sulcus and its variations are sometimes referred to as external calcarine sulci.</div><div class="text" id="p1425">Given the anatomical constancy of the calcarine and parieto-occipital sulci on the medial occipital surface, the cuneus is always a well-defined wedge-like convolution. The real anterior border of the cuneus is the cuneal limiting sulcus within the parieto-occipital fissure. Posteriorly, the cuneus rests over the posterior part of the calcarine sulcus and over the posterior aspect of the lingual gyrus. Superior to the posterior part of the calcarine sulcus, the cuneus harbours the paracalcarine or cuneal sulcus (the inferior sagittal sulcus of the cuneus of Retzius) and, further dorsally, the occipital paramedial sulcus (the paramesial sulcus of Elliot Smith or superior sagittal sulcus of Retzius). The basal or inferior surface of the occipital lobe is continuous with the basal surface of the temporal lobe. It is formed, from medial to lateral, by the lingual (also known as the medial occipito-temporal gyrus), fusiform (also known as the lateral occipito-temporal gyrus), and inferior occipital gyri respectively. The lingual gyrus lies inferiorly along the entire length of the calcarine sulcus, forming the mediobasal portion of the occipital lobe. It is continuous anteriorly with the parahippocampal gyrus and its basal surface rests on the tentorium cerebelli. Posteriorly, it is frequently divided into a superior and inferior part by an intralingual sulcus, which may be a posteromedial ramus of the collateral sulcus.</div><div class="text" id="p1430">The fusiform gyrus lies along the temporo-occipital transition. Its posterior or occipital part is bounded medially by the collateral sulcus and laterally by the occipito-temporal sulcus; hence it lies between the lingual gyrus medially and the inferior occipital gyrus laterally. The occipital part of the fusiform gyrus lies over the tentorium cerebelli just posterior to the petrous part of the temporal bone. Topographically, it corresponds to the floor of the ventricular atrium; the temporal part of the gyrus lies beneath the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. The posterior portion of the fusiform gyrus contains the midfusiform sulcus lying between the collateral and occipito-temporal sulci (<a href="../B978070207705000032X/B978070207705000032X_bib.xhtml#bib157" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_157">Weiner and Zilles 2016</a>). The midfusiform sulcus is of functional importance, because it points to cortical areas involved in object recognition, face perception and reading.</div><div class="text" id="p1435">The occipitotemporal sulcus rarely extends posteriorly as far as the occipital pole; both the collateral and occipitotemporal sulci frequently have secondary side branches and merge anteriorly. The inferior or basal aspect of the inferior occipital gyrus lies lateral to the fusiform gyrus and constitutes the most inferior portion of the lateral aspect of the occipital lobe. Along the inferolateral border of the hemisphere, the inferior temporal gyrus is continuous with the inferior occipital gyrus over the occipito-temporal incisure (preoccipital notch), and the inferior occipital gyrus is continuous with the lingual gyrus along the occipital pole. Along the parietal and occipital aspects of the superomedial border of the hemisphere, the superior parietal lobule is continuous with the precuneus, and the superior occipital gyrus is continuous with the cuneus above the calcarine sulcus and with the lingual gyrus below the calcarine sulcus.</div></section><section><a id="s0240"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0230">Occipital lobe internal structure and connectivity</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1440">The occipital lobe is composed of Brodmann’s areas BA17, BA18 and BA19 and part of BA37.

V1 receives visual afferent fibres from the lateral geniculate nucleus via the optic radiations. The retina of each eye can be divided into a nasal (medial) and temporal (lateral) half, and the left and right visual fields of each eye are composed of a lateral and medial half, the latter partially overlapping in the midline. Each lateral visual field is perceived by the ipsilateral nasal retina and each medial visual field is perceived by the ipsilateral temporal retina. The fibres from the nasal retinae form the medial half of the optic nerve and decussate in the optic chiasma to form the optic tract with the temporal fibres of the contralateral retina. Projections of the ipsilateral and contralateral retinae reach the lateral geniculate nucleus where representations of the visual hemifields remain segregated in the magnocellular (layers 1–2) and parvocellular layers (layers 3–6). The fibres of the optic radiations originating from the lateral geniculate nucleus terminate in strict retinotopic fashion in the ipsilateral striate area. The cortex of each hemisphere receives impulses from two hemi-retinae, which represent the contralateral half of the binocular visual field. Superior and inferior retinal quadrants are connected with corresponding areas of the striate cortex.

The peripheral nasal parts of the retinae (monocular periphery of the visual field) projects on the most anterior parts in the visual cortex near to the splenium of the corpus callosum: this is the small monocular part of V1.

Layers II/III consist of excitatory pyramidal cells and receive massive inputs from layer IVc neurones but only a few thalamic inputs. They are also connected through reciprocal projections with layer V neurones. The neurones of layers II/III have cortico-cortical projections to the extrastriate regions V2, V3, V4 and V5. About 20% of the cells in layers II/III are GABAergic inhibitory interneurones. Layer IV of V1 is divided into three sublayers: IVa, IVb (which harbours the heavily myelinated stria of Gennari and contains a few cells, mainly interneurones), and IVc (<a href="../B978070207705000032X/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0320"><span class="bold">Fig. 32.57B</span></a>).

Cells with simple, complex and hypercomplex receptive fields are found in V1. Simple cells are mainly in layer IV and respond optimally to lines in a narrowly defined position. Complex cells occur in layers II and III or layers V and VI, and respond to stimuli within a receptive field, but with a specific orientation. Hypercomplex cells are also found in layers II and III or layers V and VI: their response is similar to that of complex cells, but the length of a line is critical.

Interleaved ‘interblob’ regions form discrete structures between CO blobs. Layer II/III neurones in the CO blob region receive direct affrents from the interlaminar cells of LGN (I-pathway). Although CO blobs have often been associated with colour vision, their function remains elusive. Direct connections from the blob areas of V1 pass to V4. Output from V1 terminates in the claustrum, lateral geniculate nucleus, superior colliculus, pretectum and parts of the brainstem reticular formation; efferents to the striatum and pontine nuclei are sparse.</div><div class="text" id="p1480">The human extrastriate visual cortex covers the remainder of the occipital lobe and extends into the temporal and parietal lobes, which means that about 20% of the entire cerebral cortex is covered by the visual system.</div><div class="text" id="p1485">Area V2, which overlaps in part with BA18, contains a complete retinotopic representation of the visual hemifield, which is a mirror image of that in V1, with the vertical meridian along the border between areas V1 and V2.

The blob areas of V1 project to the colour-sensitive neurones of the thin stripes, and those of the interblob regions of V1 terminate in the interstripe regions of V2. The thin stripes of V2 project to V4. The thick stripes of V2 receive input from layer IVb of V1. The neurones in the thick stripes are orientation- and direction-selective, and are also sensitive to binocular disparity, which allows them to code depth information. Reciprocal projections from V2 pass to several other visual areas, including V3 and its subdivisions (V3/V3d, VP/V3v, V3a; see <a href="../B978070207705000032X/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0320">Fig. 32.57O–Q</a>), V4, V5 and areas in the temporal and parietal association cortices and frontal eye field. Afferents to V2 arrive from the lateral geniculate nucleus, inferior and lateral pulvinar nuclei and parts of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei. Subcortical efferents of V2 arise in layers V and VI and pass to the striatum, thalamus, claustrum, superior colliculus, pretectum, brainstem reticular formation, and pons.

V3d receives input from V1, whereas V3v does not. V3d shows less colour selectivity and greater directional selectivity than V3v. Both areas receive projections from V2 and are interconnected. A further visual area, area V3a, lies anterior to V3d and receives afferents from V1, V2, V3d and V3v.

It receives afferents from V2, and is colour- and orientation-selective. Bilateral damage, e.g. caused by localized ischaemia, leads to achromatopsia. V4 is also involved in orientation, form and movement selectivity. It projects reciprocally to the inferior temporal cortex and also connects with other visual areas in the temporal and parietal lobes and with the pulvinar and intralaminar thalamic nuclei. Visual processing in the inferior temporal and temporoparietal lobes is realized via the dorsal and ventral visual streams that emanate from the occipital lobe. The dorsal pathway, concerned primarily with visuospatial discrimination, projects from V1 and V2 to the temporal and parietal cortices and enables sensory-motor transformations for visually guided actions directed at an object. V4 is an important relay station for the ventral stream, which is related to the perceptual identification of various classes of objects (see below). It is connected along the inferior temporal gyrus with the posterior, intermediate and anterior parts of the inferior temporal cortex, which feed into the temporal polar and medial temporal areas of the language and limbic networks.</div><div class="text" id="p1500">The motion-selective area V5 (also called hMT+) (see <a href="../B978070207705000032X/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0320">Fig. 32.57O–Q</a>) is located close to the junction of the occipital, temporal and parietal lobes and can be identified by its intense myelination. It receives input from layer IVb of V1 and the thick stripes of V2, forming a further M-pathway. Its cells are direction- and motion-sensitive. It is surrounded by the areas MST and FST that process higher-order aspects of stimulus motion. Bilateral lesions of V5 cause akinetopsia, a severe impairment in detecting the movements of objects.</div><div class="text" id="p1505">Higher-order visual areas, selective for specific objects such as faces, words or buildings, are localized lateral to the collateral sulcus in the fusiform gyrus around the midfusiform sulcus.

Recognition of faces, numbers and words are associated with a central visual field bias, whereas the recognition of buildings depends on peripheral vision.

The isocortical part of the temporal lobe is related with auditory functions and, in the dominant hemisphere, mostly with language.

The middle temporal gyrus is connected to the angular gyrus beneath the distal and horizontal portion of the superior temporal sulcus. The inferior temporal gyrus is continuous posteriorly with the inferior occipital gyrus over the preoccipital notch (occipito-temporal incisure). Both superior and inferior temporal sulci start at the most anterior aspect of the temporal pole and end posterior to the arbitrary border of the temporal lobe, and both have their depths directed towards the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle.

Although not extensive, the fusiform gyrus has an anterior or temporal part between the inferior temporal and parahippocampal gyri, and a posterior or occipital part between the inferior occipital and lingual gyri. The anterior part of the fusiform gyrus is typically curved or pointed, resembling an arrow; its anterior border usually lies close to the level of the cerebral peduncle.

The ‘dorsal’ pathway connects posterior temporal areas with the posterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; the ‘ventral’ pathway terminates in the anterior prefrontal cortex. In this context, the arcuate fascicle and the extreme capsule are particularly important for the impairment in Wernicke’s aphasia. Considering that the dorsal and ventral prefrontal regions are characterized by spatial and non-spatial functional domains, it has been proposed that auditory information is channelled into at least two parallel processing streams: a dorsal or ‘where’ stream that subserves spatial localization, and a ventral or ‘what’ stream that subserves auditory object or pattern recognition. It has been shown that the anterior belt is responsive to the spectrotemporal features of a sound that code object identity, whereas neurones in the caudal belt are more sensitive to the spatial properties of a sound. It thus appears that object and spatial information is transmitted in different pathways beyond the auditory cortex.</div><div class="text" id="p1605">BA21 on the middle temporal cortex is multimodal.

BA21 also projects to the temporal pole and the entorhinal cortex. Thalamic connections are with the pulvinar nuclei and the intralaminar group.

The posterior inferior temporal cortex receives major ipsilateral corticocortical fibres from V4. It contains a coarse retinotopic representation of the contralateral visual field and sends a major feed-forward pathway to the anterior part of the inferior temporal cortex. The anterior part of BA20 projects onto the temporal pole and the medial surface of the temporal lobe. Additional ipsilateral connections are with the parieto-temporal region. BA20 is also connected to BA46, the fronto-orbital cortex and the frontal eye field. Reciprocal thalamic connections are with the pulvinar and the intralaminar nuclei. Callosal connections are between corresponding areas and the adjacent higher visual areas of each hemisphere.</div><div class="text" id="p1615">The cortex of the temporal pole receives feed-forward projections from widespread areas of temporal association cortex that are immediately posterior to it. The dorsal part receives predominantly auditory input from the anterior part of the superior temporal gyrus. The inferior part receives visual input from the anterior area of the inferior temporal cortex. Other ipsilateral connections are with the anterior insular, posterior and medial orbitofrontal, and medial prefrontal cortices. The temporal pole projects onwards into limbic and paralimbic areas. Thalamic connections are mainly with the medial pulvinar and with intralaminar and midline nuclei. Physiological responses of cells in this and more medial temporal cortex correspond particularly to behavioural performance and to the recognition of high-level aspects of social stimuli. Bilateral lesions of the temporopolar cortex cause retrograde amnesia (loss of all remote memories, but sparing learning and recent memory). Patients with these lesions suffer from a loss of autobiographical memories and the ability to recognize faces and names. The awareness of consolidated recognition of objects thus seems to occur in the temporo-polar cortex.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0260"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0250">Insular lobe</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1620">The roughly triangular-shaped insular lobe (island of Reil) forms the base of the Sylvian cistern and lies between the frontal and temporal lobes (see <a href="../B978070207705000032X/B978070207705000032X.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 32.1</a>).

The insula seems to play a major role as a convergence zone and is implicated in the coordination between internal and external information through emotional subjective awareness.

The anterior surface of the insula is covered by the fronto-orbital operculum (the posterior portion of the posterior orbital gyrus and the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus). Its lateral surface is covered superiorly by the frontoparietal operculum (triangular and opercular parts of the inferior frontal gyrus, subcentral gyrus, and anterior and basal part of the supramarginal gyrus) and inferiorly by the temporal operculum (polar plane of the superior temporal gyrus). Its anteroinferior vertex is the limen insulae, a narrow strip of olfactory cortex that extends along the lateral aspect of the lateral olfactory stria, conjoining the insular cortex and anterior perforate substance. The surface of the insula is divided into anterior and posterior parts by a deep central insular sulcus that courses obliquely from the limen insulae towards the central sulcus between frontal and parietal lobes. The anterior part of the insular surface is composed of short insular gyri (anterior, middle and posterior short insular gyri). The transverse insular gyrus runs along the limen insulae, connecting the anterior insula with the posteromedial part of the fronto-polar cortex. The latter is the connection between the posterior portion of the medial orbital gyrus and the posterior orbital gyrus, and is located anterior to and along the lateral olfactory stria. The accessory gyrus extends from the anterior portion of the anterior short gyrus superiorly to the transverse insular gyrus, beneath the fronto-orbital operculum. Both gyri constitute the insular pole within the anterior aspect of the insula. The posterior part of the insula is located behind its central sulcus and is composed of anterior and posterior insular long gyri. Both of these gyri are separated by the postcentral insular sulcus; the anterior long gyrus is usually larger, and may be single or divided at its upper end (see <a href="../B978070207705000032X/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0095">Fig. 32.62</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0270"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0260">Insular lobe internal structure and connectivity</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1640">Cytoarchitectonically, four major zones are recognized within the insula.

It crosses the midline just ventral to the supraoptic recess of the third ventricle, immediately anterior to the major component of the column of the fornix that projects to the mammillary body, and posterior to the smaller components of the fornix that project to the septal nuclei (see <a href="../B978070207705000032X/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0115">Fig. 32.77B</a>). At this point, the anterior commissure bulges inside the third ventricle, just underneath the interventricular foramen. The lamina terminalis is attached superiorly to the midline segment of the anterior commissure and inferiorly to the upper surface of the optic chiasma; the optic recess of the third ventricle is the cleft between the lamina terminalis and the midportion of the superior surface of the chiasma.</div><div class="text" id="p1825">Each side of the anterior commissure is composed of a well-defined posterolateral bundle (the hemispheric part) and a smaller, anterior component (the olfactory part) (<a href="../B978070207705000032X/B978070207705000032X_bib.xhtml#bib50" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_50">Déjérine and Déjerine-Klumke 1895</a>). The anterior component curves forwards and vertically through the anterior perforated substance towards each olfactory tubercle. The hemispheric component curves posterolaterally, passing through a deep groove on the anteroinferior aspect of the globus pallidus, and fanning out mostly to the anterior part of the temporal lobe, including the parahippocampal gyrus, but also reaching the occipital lobe posteriorly. This component of the anterior commissure runs parallel to the amygdolofugal peduncles which carry information from the amygdala to the hypothalamic nuclei (<a href="../B978070207705000032X/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0115">Fig. 32.77B</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1830">When passing under the inferior limiting sulcus of the insula, superior to the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle, the fibres of the anterior commissure join the temporal stem, merging with the fibres of the uncinate and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi. They pass posteriorly as the sagittal stratum, together with the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and the fibres of the optic radiation, over the lateral aspect of the temporal horn and ventricular atrium. Within the temporal stem, the fibres of the anterior commissure are mostly medial to the uncinate fasciculus; both are inferior to the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Within the sagittal stratum, they intermingle but run predominantly below the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, superior to the fibres of the optic radiation. The line between the anterior and posterior commissures, the AC–PC line, is a very important landmark in stereotactic atlases, used when localizing neuroanatomical targets for stereotactic neurosurgical procedures.</div></section><section><a id="s0335"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0325">Hippocampal commissure</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1835">The hippocampal commissure (commissure of the fornix) is a thin triangular sheet of fibres that lies between the crura of the fornices, connecting the hippocampi (<a href="../B978070207705000032X/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0395"><span class="bold">Fig. 32.78</span></a>).

They include large numbers of both corticofugal (descending) and corticopetal (ascending) fibres. Most of the projection fibres originating in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes converge in the corona radiata and from here pass through the internal capsule to reach their subcortical targets. The projections forming the internal capsule are termed capsular projections and are separated from the non-capsular projections. The extracapsular fibres include the cortico-striatal projections directed to the most external putamen and projections to the claustrum course through the external capsule. The largest limbic projection tracts (fornix, ansa peduncularis, extracapsular thalamic peduncle, ansa and stria terminalis) also have an extracapsular course and do not contribute to the corona radiata. Except for the fornix and cingulum, most of the temporal projection tracts pass through the temporal stem which can be considered as the posterior extension of the external/extreme capsule. The term temporal stem is derived from its appearance in coronal sections of the temporal lobe, where the region resembles a small cauliflower composed of a single short stem and small florets that correspond to the five longitudinal temporal gyri. The stem originates from the floor <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="538" id="pagebreak_538"/>of the external/extreme capsule; in its narrowest portion it is contained within a space delimited medially by the lateral ventricle and laterally by the inferior branch of the peri-insular sulcus. Within the posterior temporal stem, these fibres run parallel to the lateral ventricle before spreading outward into the temporal gyri to reach their cortical targets.</div><section><a id="s0345"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0335">Internal capsule</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1850">The internal capsule has the shape of a V in horizontal section (axial images), with its vertex (genu) located medially between the head of the caudate nucleus and the thalamus (<a href="../B978070207705000032X/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0400"><span class="bold">Fig. 32.79</span></a>). For descriptive purposes, the internal capsule is arbitrarily divided into five parts: anterior limb, located between the putamen and the head of the caudate nucleus; genu, lying laterally and adjacent to the interventricular foramen (of Monro); posterior limb, located between the putamen and the thalamus; retrolenticular or retrolentiform portion, located posterior to the putamen; and sublenticular (or sublentiform) portion, located inferior to the putamen (see <a href="../B978070207705000032X/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0400">Fig. 32.79</a>). The internal capsule contains thalamo-cortical fibres that form the thalamic peduncles, the majority of the cortico-striatal fibres, cortico-nuclear and cortico-spinal tracts that course through the cerebral peduncles, and projections to other nuclei of the brainstem.</div><div id="p1855"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0400"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000032X/main.assets/on32-58-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0430"/><a id="fspara0400"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 32.79</span> A horizontal section through the internal capsule illustrating its main components.</figcaption></figure></div></div><section><a id="s0350"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0340">Corticospinal and corticonuclear tracts</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1860">The corticospinal tract provides direct control by the cerebral cortex over motor centres in the contralateral spinal cord. The corticonuclear tract fulfils a similar function in relation to the motor nuclei of the brainstem that give origin to cranial nerves.</div><div class="text" id="p1865">About 20–30% of corticospinal fibres arise from the pyramidal cells in layer V of BA4. The remaining corticospinal fibres originate from the premotor cortex and parietal areas of the postcentral gyrus, superior parietal lobule and operculum. Many axons from BA4 terminate in the ventral horn of the spinal cord: a small percentage establish direct monosynaptic connections with α-motoneurones. Between 40% and 60% of pyramidal tract axons arise from parietal areas, including area 3a, area 5 of the superior part of the parietal lobe and secondary somatosensory areas in the parietal operculum. The majority of parietal fibres to the spinal cord terminate in the deeper layers of the dorsal horn. Motor cortical neurones are active in relation to the force of contraction of agonist muscles; their relation to the amplitude of movement is less clear. Their activity precedes the onset of electromyographic activity by 50–100 milliseconds, suggesting a role for cortical activation in generating rather than monitoring movement.</div><div class="text" id="p1870">The corticospinal and corticonuclear fibres that arise within the precentral gyrus are disposed as a fan on a coronal plane throughout the corona radiata. They cross the corpus callosum before entering the genu and posterior limb of the internal capsule (see <a href="../B978070207705000032X/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0390">Fig. 32.76</a>, <span class="bold">Video 32.1</span>). To join the internal capsule, the corticospinal and corticonuclear fibres not only converge but also undergo an internal rotation of approximately 90 degrees, because the main axes of the precentral gyrus and of the internal capsule genu and posterior limb are almost perpendicular. Throughout their course the fibres retain their somatotopical motor arrangement, organized according to the homuncular cortical representation, adopting an anterior–cranial to a posterior–caudal disposal along the genu (corticonuclear tract) and the posterior limb (corticospinal tract) of the internal capsule. Within the posterior limb of the internal capsule the fibres concerned with the upper limb are anterior to the fibres representing the trunk and lower limbs. From the internal capsule the fibres converge further into the cerebral peduncles, where the corticospinal and corticonuclear fibres are located in the middle half of the crus between frontopontine fibres (medially) and corticopontine fibres from temporal, parietal and occipital cortices (laterally).</div><div class="text" id="p1875">Other descending axons include frontopontine fibres (Arnold’s bundle), particularly from areas 4 and 6, and corticorubral fibres, coursing through the anterior limb of the internal capsule. The retrolenticular part of the internal capsule contains parietopontine, occipitopontine and occipitotectal fibres and the sublenticular part contains temporopontine and some parietopontine fibres.

The thalamic radiations from the anterior and medio-dorsal thalamic nuclei enter the anterior limb of the internal capsule and form the anterior thalamic peduncle that projects to all prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices. The thalamic nuclei of the ventral group and in part those of the lateral group give origin to the superior thalamic peduncle, which courses through both anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule, terminating in the posterior frontal cortex (from ventral anterior and ventral lateral thalamic nuclei) and parietal cortex (from ventral posterior and lateral posterior thalamic nuclei), respectively.</div><div id="p1885"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0405"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000032X/main.assets/on32-59-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0435"/><a id="fspara0405"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 32.80</span> Tractography reconstruction of the thalamic projections (<span class="bold">A</span>) and their course at different levels of the internal capsule (<span class="bold">B</span>, retrolenticular; <span class="bold">C</span>, sublenticular).

Its fibres are divided into anterior (Flechsig’s temporal knee or Meyer’s loop), central and posterior bundles. On sagittal sections, the occipital fibres are concentrically distributed around the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle in the following order: callosal fibres (the most internal layer); optic radiations and extrastriate thalamocortical projections (internal sagittal stratum of Sachs); association fibres of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (external sagittal stratum of Sachs).</div><div class="text" id="p1900">The sublenticular part of the internal capsule contains the auditory radiation from the medial geniculate body and direct fibres from the inferior colliculus, that together project to the superior temporal and transverse temporal gyri (areas 41 and 42). Thalamic fibres from the pulvinar to the temporal cortex and insula are also contained within the sublenticular part of the internal capsule. Fibres of the auditory radiation sweep anterolaterally below and behind the lentiform complex and superiorly to the temporal horn, ventricular atrium and optic radiation. As they enter the temporal stem, the auditory radiations fan out and split into two branches. The superior branch continues laterally towards Heschl’s gyrus and the surrounding cortex, where it finally projects to early auditory areas. The inferior branch continues anteriorly along the temporal stem in a space delimited by the inferior border of the putamen, the lateral ventricle and the inferior insula. It is directed towards the anterior temporal lobe and sends many projections to the amygdala and most anterior temporal cortex of the superior, middle and inferior temporal gyri. The acoustic radiations also contain fibres that run in the reverse direction from the temporal cortex and amygdala to the medial geniculate nucleus and inferior colliculus (<a href="../B978070207705000032X/B978070207705000032X_bib.xhtml#bib125" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_125">Pickles 2015</a>).

It wraps round the thalamus, from which it is separated by the choroidal fissure and the choroid plexus. The fornix consists of the fimbria, crus, body and columns or pillars. The fibres of the alveus converge to form the fimbria fornicis (see <a href="../B978070207705000032X/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0395">Fig. 32.78</a>) along the medial portion of the floor of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle. At a point beneath the splenium of the corpus callosum, the white matter of the fimbria separates from the hippocampus to become the crus fornicis. The two crura pass upwards and forwards beneath the corpus callosum, joined via fibres that cross in the commissure of the fornix (hippocampal commissure). Beyond this point, the crura merge to become the body of the fornix, which continues anteriorly within the roof of the third ventricle, below the lower border of the septum pellucidum and near the midline. At the level of the interventricular foramen (foramen of Monro) and the anterior commissure, the body splits into two anterior (precommissural) and two posterior (postcommissural) columns: the smaller anterior columns terminate in the hypothalamic nuclei whereas the larger posterior columns project to the mammillary bodies. As they separate from the underlying thalamus, the posterior columns of the fornix form the anterior margins of the interventricular foramen.</div><div class="text" id="p1910">A smaller number of fornical fibres project to the anterior thalamic nuclei (anterior medial, anterior ventral and anterior dorsal thalamic nuclei), ventral striatum, medial septum and nucleus reuniens; some are exclusively afferent to the hippocampus, e.g. from the supramammillary and raphe nuclei and the locus coeruleus (<a href="../B978070207705000032X/B978070207705000032X_bib.xhtml#bib7" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_7">Aggleton et al 2010</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000032X/B978070207705000032X_bib.xhtml#bib81" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_81">Jang and Kwon 2013</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000032X/B978070207705000032X_bib.xhtml#bib82" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_82">Jang and Kwon 2014</a>).
