The skin over the posterior aspect of the shoulder girdle is thicker and less mobile, being held to the underlying scapula by coarse connective tissue fibres. The cutaneous innervation reflects this difference in skin quality. The supraclavicular nerves (see <a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 35.1B</a>) are long, mobile nerves passing deep to platysma before piercing the muscle and the investing cervical fascia over or immediately caudal to the clavicle. The medial clavicular skin, including the skin over the sternoclavicular joint, is innervated by the small, often multifilamentous, medial supraclavicular nerve. The skin over the clavicle and over a variable extent of the anterior chest skin, including a variable extent of the anterior axillary fold, is innervated by the large, middle supraclavicular nerve. This nerve is frequently injured by injudicious incisions for the surgical treatment of fractures of the clavicle; a painful neuroma is a common outcome. The skin over the lateral clavicle, acromion and deltoid region is innervated by the lateral supraclavicular nerve or nerves. The floor of the axilla, together with part of the upper medial aspect of the arm, is supplied by the intercostobrachial nerve (lateral branch of the second intercostal nerve). Occasionally, the lateral branch of the third intercostal nerve contributes to the supply of the skin in the floor of the axilla. The lower aspect of the medial side of the upper arm is supplied by the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm. The lateral aspect of the upper arm is supplied by the upper lateral cutaneous nerve (a branch of the axillary nerve) and the lower lateral cutaneous nerve (a branch of the radial nerve). The posterior aspect is supplied by the posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm (a branch of the radial nerve). <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 49.1</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0030"><span class="bold">49.5</span></a> illustrate the approximate areas of sensory loss or disturbance after pre- or postganglionic lesions involving C4–T1.<a id="pg891"/></div><section><a id="sf0010"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000495/main.assets/f49-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 49.1</span> The approximate area of sensory loss or disturbance after proven preganglionic (avulsion) lesion of C4–T1 and C5–T1. <span class="bold">A</span>, Anterior view. <span class="bold">B</span>, Posterior view.</figcaption></figure></div></section><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="891" id="pagebreak_891"/></div><section><a id="sf0015"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000495/main.assets/f49-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 49.2</span> The approximate area of sensory loss or disturbance after complete interruption of C5 and the axillary nerve. <span class="bold">A</span>, Anterior view. <span class="bold">B</span>, Posterior view.

For example, the fasciae overlying the three muscles of the scapular fossae (subscapularis, infraspinatus and supraspinatus) are well attached and thicker medially; the fibro-osseous cuff so formed around the medial parts of the muscles affords a greater area of attachment than would be available if the muscles were attached only to the scapular fossae.

Above, it blends with the periosteum of the lateral part of the clavicle, the thin periosteum of the acromion, the crest of the scapular spine and the cranial part of the medial border of the scapula, caudal to the spine of the scapula, where it blends with the infraspinatus fascia.

It is attached medially to the sternum and is continuous with the fascia of the rectus sheath caudally. Cranially, it blends with the periosteum of the clavicle and the anterior aspect of the capsule of the sternoclavicular joint. Laterally, it is continuous with the fascia over deltoid; it forms the roof of the infraclavicular fossa between the muscular attachments of pectoralis major and deltoid to the clavicle. The fascia is loosely adherent to the septum between the sternal and clavicular parts of pectoralis major. Inferolaterally, between pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, the fascia thickens to form the floor of the axilla as the axillary fascia. At the caudal edge of pectoralis major, a deep lamina of fascia ascends to envelop the caudal border of pectoralis minor; it becomes the clavipectoral fascia at the upper edge of pectoralis minor. The hollow of the armpit is produced mainly by the action of this fascia in tethering the axillary skin to the floor of the axilla; it is sometimes referred to as the suspensory ligament of the axilla. The axillary fascia is pierced by the tail of the breast (see <a href="../B9780702077050000537/B9780702077050000537.xhtml#f0165">Fig. 53.22A</a>). The pectoral fascia envelops the lateral margin of latissimus dorsi; the deep and superficial layers ensheathe that muscle and are attached behind to the spines of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, blending with the thoracolumbar fascia medially and caudally.</div></section><section><a id="s0070"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0065">Clavipectoral fascia</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0075">The clavipectoral fascia is the superior continuation of the deep lamina of the pectoral fascia and the medial continuation of the parietal layer of the subscapular bursal fascia. Laterally, it is continuous with the coraco-acromial ligament above and lateral to the coracoid. It envelops the coracoid blending with the periosteum of the tip of that process, the short head of biceps brachii and coracobrachialis. It covers the interval between those two muscles and pectoralis minor, which it envelops, and then traverses the interval between pectoralis minor and subclavius. It splits around subclavius and is attached to the clavicle anterior and posterior to the groove for subclavius. The posterior layer is contiguous with the deep cervical fascia, a condensation of which forms a tether around the central tendinous part of omohyoid, so indirectly connecting it to the clavicle. The deep aspect of the posterior lamina of the clavipectoral fascia blends with the sheath of the axillary vessels. Medially, it blends with the fascia over the first two intercostal spaces and is attached to the first rib, medial to subclavius. Occasionally, the fascia thickens to form a band between the first rib and coracoid process, the costocoracoid ligament, under which the lateral cord of the brachial plexus is closely applied (<a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495_bib.xhtml#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_3">Atasoy 2004</a>). The cephalic vein, thoraco-acromial artery and associated veins and lymphatic vessels, and the lateral pectoral nerve all pass through the fascia immediately superior to the upper border of pectoralis minor. This fascia was called the 'clavi-coraco-axillary aponeurosis' by <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495_bib.xhtml#bib43" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_43">Testut (1904)</a>.</div></section><section><a id="s0075"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0070">Subscapular fascia</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0080">The subscapular fascia is thin and attached to the entire circumference of the subscapular fossa. Subscapularis is partly attached to its deep surface medially, which is an example of the extension of the attachment zone of a muscle for more effective action. The fascia extends laterally and blends with the deep layer of the subscapular bursa in front of the tendon of subscapularis and with the external layer of the capsule of the rotator interval of the glenohumeral joint.

Medially, just below the middle of the upper arm, it is perforated by the basilic vein, lymphatic vessels and, at various levels, by branches of the brachial cutaneous nerves.</div><div class="text" id="p0100">The fascia is thickest distally, where it contains the brachial muscles in distinct compartments anteriorly and posteriorly, and is defined medially and laterally by tough septa. The lateral intermuscular septum is continuous with the fascia overlying the lateral part of deltoid proximally, and has an upward, thinner extension to the lateral crest of the intertubercular sulcus (groove) contiguous with the fascia over the anterior border of deltoid. It is attached to the supracondylar ridge of the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, and is perforated at the level of the junction of the upper three-fifths and lower two-fifths of the humerus by the radial nerve and the radial collateral branch of the profunda brachii artery passing into the anterior compartment from behind. It provides extension for the zone of attachment of the lateral head of triceps posteriorly, and of brachialis, brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus anteriorly. The medial intermuscular septum extends from the medial lip of the intertubercular sulcus, where it is contiguous with the fascia of teres major, next blends with the aponeurosis of attachment of coracobrachialis to the medial aspect of the humerus, and then passes as a thick septum along the medial aspect of the humerus to the medial supracondylar ridge of the medial epicondyle. It gives attachment to the medial head of triceps posteriorly, and brachialis anteriorly. It is perforated by the ulnar nerve at about the same level as the radial nerve laterally, together with the superior ulnar collateral artery and the posterior branch of the inferior ulnar collateral artery. At the elbow, the brachial fascia is attached to the epicondyles of the humerus, so completing the muscular compartments, and the olecranon of the ulna, and is continuous with the antebrachial fascia.</div></section><section><a id="s0095"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0090">Axillary neurovascular sheath</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1105">The axillary neurovascular sheath is closely contiguous with the posterior aspect of the clavipectoral fascia.

Acute neural injuries occur as a result of direct injury (traction, compression, or both) to the nerve trunks, causing acute sensorimotor deficits, arterial adventitial haematoma or acute aneurysm expanding within the axillary sheath to cause the syndrome of causalgia (rapidly progressive, severe pain in the distribution of the affected nerve trunks with neural deficits). Arterial thrombosis following intimal rupture is associated with late nerve deficits as a result of inadequate neural perfusion, local scarring with distortion of the axillary sheath and its contents, and poor posture of the affected limb.</div><div class="text" id="p0115">The neurovascular bundle enclosed within the sheath is separated from the subscapular fascia by a ‘virtual space’ traversed by the subscapular nerves, an arrangement that permits full excursion of subscapularis without distortion of the neurovascular bundle during normal arm movements. The tip of the coracoid can be likened to the tip of the shaft of a steering oar attached to a vessel (the scapula) tethered within the thick clavipectoral fascia: the effect of pectoralis minor acting as an antagonist of trapezius in scapular position and motion control (see below) is optimized by the wide attachment of the clavipectoral fascia and coraco-acromial ligament to the clavicle and scapula (see <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0095">Fig. 49.18</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0100"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0095">Spread of infection</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0125">When axillary suppuration occurs, the local fascial arrangement affects the spread of pus. Suppuration may be superficial or deep to the clavipectoral fascia. In the former, an abscess would appear at the edge of the anterior axillary fold or in the groove between deltoid and pectoralis major; in the latter, pus would tend to track upwards in the axillary neurovascular sheath and appear at the root of the neck, taking the direction of least resistance. Lymphangitis in the medial aspect of the arm suggests infection deep to the clavipectoral fascia with lymphatic obstruction. When an axillary abscess is incised, the knife should enter the axillary ‘base’, midway between the anterior and posterior margins and near the thoracic side, to avoid the lateral thoracic, subscapular and axillary vessels on the anterior, posterior and lateral walls, respectively.</div></section></section></section><a id="s0105"/><hgroup><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0100">Bones</h2><h3 class="h2after1" id="cesectitle0105">Clavicle</h3></hgroup><section><a id="s0110"/><div class="textfl" id="p0130">The clavicle lies almost horizontally at the root of the neck (see <a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355.xhtml#f0070">Figs 35.13</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000483/B9780702077050000483.xhtml#f0355">48.7A</a>). It is a crank-shaped cantilever that carries the scapula, so enabling the limb to swing clear of the trunk. It transmits part of the weight of the limb to the axial skeleton. The lateral or acromial end of the bone is flattened and articulates with the medial side of the acromion, whereas the medial or sternal end is enlarged and articulates with the clavicular notch of the manubrium sterni and first costal cartilage. The shaft is gently curved and resembles the italic letter <span class="italic">f</span> in shape, being convex forwards (the antecurve) in its medial two-thirds and concave forwards (the retrocurve) in its lateral third (<a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0035"><span class="bold">Fig. 49.6</span></a>). The inferior aspect of the intermediate two-fifths is grooved in its long axis for the attachment of subclavius. Laterally, the internal architecture of the clavicle is trabecular, with a medullary cavity in the medial two-thirds. The cortical bone is thickest at the transition zone between the antecurve and retrocurve. The female clavicle is typically shorter, thinner, less curved and smoother. Mid-shaft circumference is the most reliable single indicator of sex; a combination of this measurement with weight and length yields more reliable and consistent results. The clavicle is subcutaneous throughout its whole length and accordingly can be palpated for its entire length; the medial (sternal) end forms an expanded, blunt-faced margin of the jugular notch. The anterior border of the lateral (acromial) end is not readily distinguished from the acromion; the attachment of deltoid obscures the anterior aspect of the acromioclavicular joint. By contrast, the posterior border of the lateral end forms the anterior margin of a roughly parabolic hollow under the lateral fibres of trapezius, the posterior border being formed by the anterior border of the spine of the scapula. The hollow will admit at least one palpating finger. If the pulp of the finger is placed on the spine of the scapula as far laterally as the hollow will permit, the nail will inevitably point to the posterior capsule of the acromioclavicular joint; this landmark is always palpable, <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="893" id="pagebreak_893"/><a id="pg892.e1"/>even in well-muscled individuals, when other shoulder landmarks can be obscured.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0035"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000495/main.assets/f49-06-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0035"/><a id="fspara0035"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 49.6</span> The left clavicle, showing sites of muscular and ligamentous attachment and articular surfaces. <span class="bold">A</span>, Superior view.

The anterior border is concave, thin and roughened, and may be marked by a small deltoid tubercle. The posterior border, also roughened by muscular attachments, is convex backwards. The superior surface is roughened near its margins but is smooth centrally, where it can be felt through the skin. The inferior surface presents two obvious markings. Close to the posterior border, at the junction of the lateral fourth with the rest of the bone, a prominent conoid tubercle gives attachment to the conoid part of the coracoclavicular ligament. A narrow, roughened strip, the trapezoid line, runs forwards and laterally from the lateral side of this tubercle, almost as far as the acromial end (<a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0035"><span class="bold">Fig. 49.6B</span></a>). The trapezoid part of the coracoclavicular ligament is attached to it. A small, oval articular facet, for articulation with the medial aspect of the acromion, faces laterally and slightly downwards at the lateral end of the shaft.</div><div class="text" id="p0140">Subclavius is attached to the groove on the inferior surface (see <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0035">Fig. 49.6B</a>). The clavipectoral fascia is attached to the edges of the groove. The posterior edge of the groove runs to the conoid tubercle, where fascia and conoid ligament merge. There is a laterally inclined nutrient foramen lateral to the groove. Deltoid (anteriorly) and trapezius (posteriorly) are attached to the lateral two-fifths of the shaft; both muscles are inserted directly into the clavicle and indirectly into the clavicular periosteum. The coracoclavicular ligaments, attached to the conoid tubercle and trapezoid line (see <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0035">Fig. 49.6B</a>), transmit the weight of the upper limb to the clavicle, and are counteracted by the cervical part of trapezius, which supports its lateral part (see <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0095">Fig. 49.18</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0125"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0115">Medial three-fifths</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0145">The medial three-fifths of the shaft of the clavicle are cylindrical or prismoid in form and have four surfaces, although the inferior surface is often reduced to a mere ridge. The anterior surface is roughened over most of its extent but is smooth and rounded laterally, where it forms the upper boundary of the infraclavicular fossa. The upper surface is roughened medially and smooth laterally. The posterior surface is smooth and featureless medially; its lateral half bears a groove in the long axis of the bone. The inferior surface is marked near its sternal end by a roughened oval impression, which is often depressed below the surface. Its margins give attachment to the costoclavicular ligament, which connects the clavicle to the upper surface of the first rib and its cartilage. Rarely, this area is smooth or raised to constitute an eminence that may form a synovial pseudarthrosis with the upper surface of the first rib; in older subjects, an extra-articular synostosis may form.</div><div class="text" id="p0150">The medial three-fifths provide attachment, anteriorly, for the clavicular head of pectoralis major. The clavicular head of sternocleidomastoid is attached to the medial half of the superior surface, but the marking on the bone is not conspicuous. The smooth, posterior surface is devoid of muscular attachments, except at its lower part immediately adjoining the sternal end, where the lateral fibres of sternohyoid are attached. Medially, this surface is related to the lower end of the internal jugular vein (from which it is separated by sternohyoid), the termination of the subclavian vein, and the start of the brachiocephalic vein. More laterally, the clavicle arches in front of the trunks and divisions of the brachial plexus and the third part of the subclavian artery. The thyrocervical trunk and its branches, and the suprascapular and transverse cervical vessels are immediately behind and above the upper aspect of this surface. Subclavius is inserted in the subclavian groove on the inferior surface, and the clavipectoral fascia is attached to the edges of the groove. The posterior lip of the groove is continuous with the conoid tubercle laterally and brings the clavipectoral fascia into continuity with the conoid ligament. A nutrient foramen is found in the lateral end of the groove, running in a lateral direction; the nutrient artery is derived from the suprascapular artery.</div></section><section><a id="s0130"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0120">Sternal end</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0165">The sternal end of the clavicle is directed medially, downwards and forwards, and articulates with the clavicular notch of the manubrium sterni. The sternal surface, usually irregular and pitted, is quadrangular (sometimes triangular). Its uppermost part is slightly roughened for attachment of the interclavicular ligament, sternoclavicular capsule and articular disc. Elsewhere, the surface is smooth and articular; it extends on to the inferior surface for a short distance, where it articulates with the first costal cartilage. The sternal end of the clavicle projects upwards beyond the manubrium sterni and can be felt and seen easily, forming the lateral wall of the jugular notch, behind which are the cricoid cartilage, cricothyroid membrane, the lower part of the thyroid cartilage of the larynx and the brachiocephalic vein. The sternal ends of each clavicle thus form a guide to the jugular notch: if the sternal end of the clavicle is displaced backwards (by traumatic dislocation), the landmarks of the notch are lost, the trachea is displaced and there will be difficulty breathing. If the trachea is displaced to one side (for instance, by pneumothorax), the features of the larynx cannot be palpated readily.</div><div class="text" id="p0160">The shaft of the clavicle is usually fractured as a result of a violent impact to the side of the shoulder. The fracture typically occurs at the junction of the lateral two-fifths and medial three-fifths, where the transition from antecurve to retrocurve occurs and the bone changes in cross-sectional shape from its flatter lateral part to a tubular medial part. The weight of the arm causes displacement of the lateral fragment downwards, inwards and into forward (ventral) rotation, a posture maintained even in recumbency partly by the action of subclavius. If the fracture heals in this position, the dimensions and shape of the retroclavicular space are altered, particularly during elevation of the arm above shoulder level, and the brachial plexus (and its perfusion) and the subclavian vessels can be distorted (one of the many causes of the syndrome associated with thoracic outlet obstruction).</div></section><section><a id="s0135"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0125">Ossification</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0175">The clavicle begins to ossify before any other bone in the body. The shaft of the bone undergoes intramembranous ossification in two primary centres, medial and lateral, in stages 18–20 (42–50 postfertilization days). However, the clavicle does not ossify exclusively by intramembranous ossification. Endochondral ossification extends from the shaft to the sternal and acromial ends in stages 20–21. In 14<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm embryos, the clavicle is a band of condensed mesenchyme between the acromion and apex of the first rib, and is continuous with the sternal rudiment. Medial and lateral zones of early cartilage transformation (‘precartilage’) occur within this band; intramembranous centres of ossification appear and soon fuse in the mesenchyme between them. Sternal and acromial zones become true cartilage into which ossification extends from the shaft. Length increases by interstitial growth of these terminal cartilages, which develop zones of hypertrophy, calcification and advancing endochondral ossification like other growth cartilages. Diameter increases by subperichondral deposition in the extremities and subperiosteal deposition in the shaft. A secondary centre for the sternal end appears in the late teens, or even early twenties, usually 2 years earlier in females (<a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0040"><span class="bold">Fig. 49.7</span></a>). Fusion is probably rapid but reliable data are lacking. An acromial secondary centre sometimes develops at around 18–20 years, but this epiphysis is always small and rudimentary, and rapidly joins the shaft. Growth is usually complete by 23 years in both sexes. Epiphyses are endochondral and probably fuse in the same way as they do in long bones.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0040"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000495/main.assets/f49-07-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0040"/><a id="fspara0040"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 49.7</span> The three constant centres of ossification of the clavicle.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0170">Anomalies of clavicular growth and development include defects of ossification, morphology (shape) and length. Defects of ossification in the clavicle and those cranial bones that ossify by intramembranous ossification occasionally coincide, e.g. in cleidocranial dysostosis. Defects of morphology and length occur in the immature clavicle in birth lesions of the brachial plexus; the lateral two-fifths are affected. In a typical case, the acromial end of the clavicle is short and excessively curved ventrally, rotated by up to 90°, while the coracoclavicular ligaments are normal. The coracoid is long and more vertical than usual; the scapula is often small, and the scapular neck region is short with variable glenoid dysplasia. These characteristic defects are predominantly associated with the upper trunk lesion (C5 and C6) that results in a muscular imbalance across the acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joints; the flexor and medial (internal) rotator muscles are relatively short. The short, tight pectoralis minor and coracobrachialis produce a distorting force on the coracoid, which elongates and rotates dorsally. With retropulsion of the humeral head posteriorly, the scapula rotates ventrally, particularly if there is posterior glenoid dysplasia. Deltoid shortening creates a downward distraction on the developing acromion, which lengthens and curves distally. The spine of the scapula is parallel to the body of the scapula rather than dorsally directed, and these deformities cause the acromioclavicular joint to be orientated more horizontally. As a result, the lateral clavicle is excessively curved ventrally. The concept here is that the abnormal shape is driven by asymmetrical muscle paralysis and partial recovery, and that <span class="italic">form</span> follows the neural lesion. While poor movement (causing a lack of ‘motivation’ for growth in <span class="italic">length</span>) might explain the clavicular shortening, an equally valid explanation might involve a vascular insufficiency of the lateral ossification centre of the clavicle (with a similar insufficiency of the lateral ossification centres of the scapula for the glenoid): both have a contribution from the suprascapular artery, which is ‘at risk’ during injuries that lead to brachial plexus palsy. Length is a function of perfusion and shortening follows vascular insufficiency (<a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495_bib.xhtml#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">Kambhampati et al 2006</a>).</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0140"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0130">Scapula</h3><div class="textfl" id="p7175">The scapula is a large, triangular bone that lies over the posterolateral chest wall, covering parts of the second to seventh ribs (see <a href="../B9780702077050000483/B9780702077050000483.xhtml#f0120">Fig. 48.7A</a>), <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="894" id="pagebreak_894"/><a id="pg893.e1"/>with a vertical long (craniocaudal) axis.

Three robust columns of bone, namely, the lateral border of the spine of the scapula, the coracoid and the lateral border of the scapula, thus converge at the neck region. Load applied through the glenoid fossa or through the coracoid is transmitted into the scapula through these columns, which also provide a robust framework for the scapular body.

Subscapularis arises from the subscapular fossa that comprises nearly the whole of the costal surface, including the grooved area immediately adjoining the lateral border, but excluding the area next to the neck of the bone. Small, fibrous intramuscular septa are attached to four or five roughened ridges that subdivide this surface incompletely into a number of smooth areas. The anterior aspect of the neck is separated from subscapularis by a bursal protrusion of the synovial membrane of the shoulder joint (subscapular ‘bursa’). The lower five or six digitations of serratus anterior are attached to an oval area near the inferior angle. The remainder of the muscle is inserted into a narrow strip along the ventral aspect of the medial border, which is wider above, where it receives the large first digitation. The longitudinal thickening of the bone near the lateral border provides a column of the necessary strength to withstand the pull of serratus anterior on the inferior angle during lateral scapular rotation, when the glenoid cavity is turned to face more directly upwards as the arm is raised from the side and carried above the head against gravity.</div></section><section><a id="s0155"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0140">Dorsal surface</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0195">The dorsal surface is divided by the transverse, shelf-like spine of the scapula into two unequal parts: a smaller supraspinous fossa above and an infraspinous fossa below.

The supraspinous fossa is bounded superiorly and anteriorly by the superior border, from the suprascapular notch and dorsal aspect of the root of the coracoid laterally, to the superior angle medially; and medially, by the upper part of the medial border. The infraspinous fossa is bounded by the medial and lateral borders and the inferior angle.</div><div class="text" id="p0200">Supraspinatus is attached to the medial two-thirds of the supraspinous fossa on the dorsal surface; the fascia that covers the muscle is attached to the margins of the fossa. A fat pad lies between the supraspinatus fascia and the under-surface of trapezius. Teres minor is attached to the upper two-thirds of a flattened strip that adjoins the lateral border. The strip is grooved near its upper end by the circumflex scapular vessels passing between teres minor and the bone as they enter the infraspinous fossa. The lower limit of the attachment of teres minor is indicated by an oblique ridge, which runs from the lateral border to the neighbourhood <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="895" id="pagebreak_895"/><a id="pg895"/>of the inferior angle and cuts off a somewhat oval area where teres major is attached. The dorsal aspect of the inferior angle may give origin to a small slip that joins the deep surface of latissimus dorsi. The infraspinous fossa is hollowed out laterally but is convex medially. Infraspinatus is attached to the infraspinous fossa, with the exception of an area near the neck of the bone. The strong infraspinatus fascia passes on to teres minor and teres major, and sends fascial partitions between them that reach the bone along the ridges marking the limits of their attachments.</div></section><section><a id="s0160"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0145">Superior border</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0205">The superior border, thin and sharp, is the shortest.

Medial to the suprascapular notch, the superior border gives origin to the inferior belly of omohyoid. The notch is bridged by the superior transverse ligament (or suprascapular ligament), which is attached laterally to the root of the coracoid process and medially to the limit of the notch. The ligament is sometimes ossified. The foramen, thus completed, transmits the suprascapular nerve to the supraspinous fossa, whereas the suprascapular vessels pass backwards above the ligament.</div></section><section><a id="s0165"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0150">Lateral border</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0210">The lateral border has a triangular or rhomboidal cross-section.

The lateral border separates the attachments of subscapularis and teres minor and major. These muscles project beyond the bone and, with latissimus dorsi below, cover it so completely that it cannot be felt through the skin.

It is slightly thickened and flat, and is further thickened at the medial end of the spine. In its lower two-thirds, this border can easily be felt through the skin, but its upper third is more deeply placed and more difficult to palpate. It is thin and often angled opposite the root of the spine. Levator scapulae is attached to a narrow strip, extending from the superior angle to the root of the spine, and rhomboid minor is attached below this, opposite the root of the spine. Rhomboid major is attached to the remainder of the border.</div></section><section><a id="s0175"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0160">Scapular angles</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0225">The inferior angle lies over the seventh rib, or over the seventh intercostal space. It can be felt through the skin and the muscles that cover it, and, when the arm is raised above the head, it can be seen to rotate forwards (protract) around the chest wall; when the arm is lowered, the scapula should restitute (retract) to its original position without a disturbance of rhythm. It is covered on its dorsal aspect by the upper border of latissimus dorsi, a small slip from which is frequently attached to the inferior angle. The superior angle, at the junction of the superior and medial borders, is obscured by the upper part of trapezius. It lies over the dorsal surface of the second rib and can be palpated deeply above and behind the clavicle.</div><div class="text" id="p0230">The lateral angle, truncated and broad, comprises the glenoid fossa (cavity) and scapular neck, with the coracoid projecting forwards. When the arm is by the side, the fossa is directed forwards, laterally and slightly upwards. When the arm is raised above the head, it is directed almost straight upwards, i.e. the plane of the fossa is horizontal. The supraglenoid tubercle is a small, rough, sloping area at the cranial margin of the fossa; <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="896" id="pagebreak_896"/><a id="pg896"/>it often encroaches on the root of the coracoid process, and is the site of attachment for the tendon of the long head of biceps brachii. The infraglenoid tubercle is a larger, rough area at the caudal margin of the glenoid fossa, at the upper end of the lateral margin, and is the site of attachment for the tendon of the long head of the triceps brachii. The anatomical neck is the region of the scapula extending between the infraglenoid and supraglenoid tubercles anteriorly and posteriorly, lateral to the root of the coracoid process; anteriorly, there is no landmark to distinguish the anatomical neck from the costal surface of the body of the scapula. Posteriorly, the anatomical neck is limited by the spinoglenoid notch at the root of the spine of the scapula. The bone here has an asymmetric, triangular cross-sectional shape; the plane of the anterior surface of the neck makes an acute angle of about 60° with the plane of the glenoid fossa, but the dimension and shape of the posterior surface are more variable.</div></section><section><a id="s0180"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0165">Spine of the scapula</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0235">The spine of the scapula forms a shelf-like projection on the upper part of the dorsal surface of the bone, and is triangular in shape (see <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0045">Fig. 49.8A</a>). Its lateral border is free, thick and rounded, and bounds the spinoglenoid notch, which lies between it and the dorsal surface of the neck of the bone. Its anterior aspect joins the dorsal surface of the scapula along a line that runs laterally and slightly upwards from the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the medial border. The plate-like body of the bone is bent along this line, which accounts for the concavity of the upper part of the costal surface. The dorsal border is the crest of the spine and is subcutaneous throughout nearly its whole extent. The crest expands into a smooth, triangular area at its medial end. Elsewhere, the upper and lower edges and the surface of the crest are roughened for muscular attachments. The upper surface of the spine widens as it is traced laterally and is slightly hollowed out. Together with the upper area of the dorsal surface of the bone, the upper surface of the spine forms the supraspinous fossa. The lower surface is overhung by the crest at its medial, narrow end, but is gently convex in its wider, lateral portion. Together with the lower area of the dorsal surface of the bone, the lower surface of the spine forms the infraspinous fossa, which communicates with the supraspinous fossa through the spinoglenoid notch.</div><div class="text" id="p0240">Supraspinatus is attached to the upper surface of the spine of the scapula; the infraspinatus, by contrast, is not attached to the lower surface of the spine. The flattened triangular area at its root lies opposite the spine of the third thoracic vertebra and is covered by the tendon of trapezius; a bursa intervenes to enable the tendon to play over this part of the bone. The posterior fibres of deltoid are attached to the lower border of the crest and, to a variable extent, to the medial border by attachment to the infraspinatus fascia. The middle fibres of trapezius are attached to the upper border of the crest. The lowest fibres of trapezius terminate in a flat, triangular tendon that glides over the smooth area at the base of the spine and inserts into a rough prominence, erroneously called the deltoid tubercle, on the dorsal or subcutaneous aspect of the spine near its medial end.</div></section><section><a id="s0185"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0170">Acromion</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0245">The acromion projects forwards, almost at right-angles, from the lateral end of the spine, with which it is continuous. The lower border of the crest of the spine becomes continuous with the lateral border of the acromion at the acromial angle, which forms a reliable, subcutaneous, bony landmark. The medial border of the acromion is short and is marked anteriorly by a small, oval facet, directed upwards and medially, for articulation with the lateral end of the clavicle. The lateral border, tip and upper surface of the acromion can all be felt through the skin without difficulty. There may be an accessory articular facet on the inferior surface of the acromion.</div><div class="text" id="p0250">The acromion is subcutaneous over its dorsal surface, being covered only by the skin and superficial fascia. The lateral border, which is thick and irregular, and the tip of the process, as far round as the clavicular facet, give origin to the middle fibres of deltoid. The medial aspect of the tip gives attachment, below deltoid, to the lateral end of the coraco-acromial ligament. The articular capsule of the acromioclavicular joint is attached around the margins of the clavicular facet. Behind the facet, the medial border of the acromion gives insertion to the horizontal (middle) fibres of trapezius. The inferior aspect of the acromion is relatively smooth and forms a protective arch over the shoulder joint, together with the coraco-acromial ligament and the coracoid process. The tendon of supraspinatus passes below the overhanging acromion and is separated from it and from deltoid by the subacromial bursa.</div></section><section><a id="s0190"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0175">Coracoid process</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0255">The coracoid process arises from the upper border of the neck of the scapula and its body is bent sharply so as to project forwards and slightly laterally (see <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0045">Figs 49.8</a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0050">49.9</a>). When the arm is by the side, the coracoid process points almost straight forwards. Its tip can be felt through the skin and is covered by the anterior fibres of deltoid, about 2.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm below the clavicle at the junction of the lateral fifth with the rest of the bone, at the lateral border of the infraclavicular fossa. It forms a short, curved cantilever fixed to the scapula at its base and is displaced by the actions of the muscles attached to its body and tip. Pectoralis minor pulls the coracoid (and, therefore, the scapula) forwards and medially around the chest wall, balanced by trapezius, its antagonist; this action forms the foundation on which coracobrachialis can help support the long lever arm of the humerus during humeral motion, together with its antagonist, the deltoid. During forceful forward elevation of the protracted shoulder girdle, subclavius and pectoralis minor may contribute to deceleration of the limb.</div><div class="text" id="p0260">The infraclavicular brachial plexus and the axillary vessels lie below and medial to the coracoid. The acromial branch of the thoraco-acromial artery passes above it, and the sensory branch of the lateral pectoral nerve to the rotator interval capsule, together with accompanying vessels, lies immediately below.</div><div class="text" id="p0265">On the dorsal aspect of the coracoid process, at the point where it changes direction, a rough impression forms part of the region of attachment of the conoid portion of the coracoclavicular ligament. The trapezoid portion of the coracoclavicular ligament is attached to the upper aspect of the horizontal part of the process, anterior to the conoid part. Pectoralis minor is attached to the superior and medial aspects of the coracoid process. The wider, medial, end of the coraco-acromial ligament is attached to the lateral border and is continuous inferiorly with the lateral aponeurotic part of the tendon of the short head of biceps brachii. The coracohumeral ligament is attached to the root of the coracoid at its lateral border. The interval between the anterior aspect of the scapular neck immediately medial to the glenoid fossa and the deep surface of the coracoid is often bridged by the glenocoracoid ligament. The inferior aspect of the coracoid process is otherwise smooth and saddle-shaped. When the arm is elevated, the upper border of subscapularis is apposed to, and runs under, this surface, which forms a pulley for the muscle, increasing the power generated during forceful medial (internal) rotation of the shoulder in elevation, such as during a serve in tennis. Coracobrachialis is attached to the deep aspect of the lower part of the medial side and the deep surface of the tip of the process, and the short head of biceps is attached to the lateral side and superficial aspect of the tip.</div></section><section><a id="s0195"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0180">Scapular movements</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0270">Scapular movement is a product of interconnected suspension, motion and articulation mechanisms. The suspension mechanism consists of the scapular articulation with the clavicle and the suspension muscles of the scapula and clavicle, notably trapezius, attached to the lateral clavicle, the acromion and the spine of scapula, and its antagonists pectoralis minor and subclavius. The articulation with the clavicle comprises two linked systems: ‘clavicle – acromioclavicular joint – acromion – spine of scapula – lateral scapular angle’ and ‘clavicle – coracoclavicular ligament – coracoid – lateral scapular angle – spine of scapula’. This mechanism therefore subserves the function of scapular rotation or tilt limited by the ellipsoid range of motion of the lateral clavicle. The motion mechanism consists of the agonist–antagonist force couple of serratus anterior passing to the chest wall anterolaterally, and levator scapulae, rhomboid major, rhomboid minor and serratus posterior (when present), which all pass to the vertebral column medially. This mechanism therefore subserves the function of scapular protraction and retraction around the elliptic paraboloid of the chest wall. The articulation mechanism consists of the scapular neck region and the glenoid fossa, which articulates with the humeral head. The muscles that subserve the function of holding the humeral head on the glenoid through the wide range of motion of the glenohumeral joint are the rotator cuff muscles, which take their attachment from the body of the scapula. This mechanism therefore concerns the relationship between the position and orientation of the glenoid fossa and the scapular body.</div></section><section><a id="s0200"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0185">Ossification</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0295">The cartilaginous scapula is ossified from eight or more centres: one in the body, two each in the coracoid process and the acromion, and one each in the medial border, inferior angle and lower part of the rim of the glenoid cavity <span class="bold">(</span><a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0055"><span class="bold">Fig. 49.10</span></a>). The medial part originates from dermomyotomes of somites 17–24 (level of fifth cervical vertebra – level of fifth thoracic vertebra) and the lateral part from somatopleuric mesenchyme. The primary ossification centre for the body appears in stage 23 (53–58 postfertilization days). Ossification begins in the middle of the coracoid process in the first year or, in a small proportion of individuals, before birth; the process joins the rest of the bone about the fifteenth year. At or soon after puberty, centres of ossification occur in the rest of <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="897" id="pagebreak_897"/><a id="pg897"/>the coracoid process (subcoracoid centre), in the rim of the lower part of the glenoid cavity, frequently at the tip of the coracoid process, in the acromion, in the inferior angle and contiguous part of the medial border and in the medial border. A variable area of the upper part of the glenoid cavity, usually the upper third, is ossified from the subcoracoid centre; it unites with the rest of the bone in the fourteenth year in the female and the seventeenth year in the male. A horseshoe-shaped epiphysis appears for the rim of the lower part of the glenoid cavity; thicker at its peripheral than at its central margin, it converts the flat glenoid cavity of the child into the gently concave fossa of the adult. The base of the acromion is formed by an extension from the spine; the rest of the acromion is ossified from two centres that unite and then join the extension from the spine. The various epiphyses of the scapula have all joined the bone by about the twentieth year.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0055"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000495/main.assets/f49-10-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0055"/><a id="fspara0055"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 49.10</span> Ossification of the scapula. <span class="bold">A</span>, Dorsal aspect. <span class="bold">B</span>, Lateral aspect. <br/><span class="figcredit">Adapted with permission from Drake RL, Vogl AW, Mitchell A (eds), Gray's Anatomy for Students, 2nd ed.

With further development, the scapula alters shape. Initially, the horizontal diameter exceeds the vertical but the ratio gradually decreases until mature dimensions are reached, an adaptation thought to provide upright hominids with increased range, and therefore freedom of use, of the upper limb. Avian gene-deletion studies have shed light on the development of the scapula. Scapular body development appears to be controlled by the <span class="italic">Emx2</span> gene, also expressed in the developing mesonephros. The development of the acromion and the spine of the scapula are controlled by the <span class="italic">Pax1</span> gene, and glenoid and coracoid development is controlled by the <span class="italic">Hoxc6</span> gene (<a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495_bib.xhtml#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_28">Huang et al 2000</a>), one of the homeobox genes responsible for somite differentiation and development; development of the glenoid and coracoid appears likely to be more intimately related to the development of the upper limb bud as a whole. The development of the scapular body appears to be independent of that of the processes and glenoid region. Adult scapulae may show a line of fusion across the body and spine of the scapula, suggesting that the primordia of the processes (including the glenoid) and the primordium of the body migrate towards each other; since the trapezius is derived from branchial arch mesoderm it would appear that the development of the spine of the scapula and acromion and trapezius are intimately related, but separate from the body. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that; in the condition of congenital undescended scapular syndrome (Sprengel deformity), the development of the scapular body is altered, and there is intramuscular ossification of variable parts of the medial scapulospinal muscles; the development of the processes (including the glenoid) is unaffected (<a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495_bib.xhtml#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_19">Dhir and Lambert 2014</a>; <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495_bib.xhtml#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Dhir et al 2018</a>). Since the medial border of the scapula develops from the dermomyotomes of somites 17–24 (see above) any vertebral anomalies at this level may result in tethering of scapular structures to the cervical spine, sometimes by an abnormal omovertebral tether (fibrous, chondral, or osseous), that prevents the upper border of the scapula descending to its usual position.</div></section><section><a id="s0205"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0190">Ligaments</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0285">The intrinsic scapular ligaments are strengthening ligaments (coraco-acromial ligament) and bounding ligaments (superior transverse scapular or suprascapular ligament, inferior transverse scapular or spinoglenoid ligament, and the variable glenocoracoid ligament).</div><section><a id="s0210"/><section><a id="s0215"/><section><a id="s0220"/><section><a id="s0225"/><p class="h8hd" id="cesectitle0195">Coraco-acromial ligament</p><div class="textfl" id="p0290">The coraco-acromial ligament is a strong triangular band between the coracoid process and acromion. It is attached apically to the acromion anterior to the articular surface for the clavicle, and by its base along the whole lateral border of the coracoid. Together with the coracoid process and acromion, it completes an arch above the humeral head. It may be composed of two strong marginal bands with a thinner centre; when pectoralis minor is inserted into the humeral capsule instead of the coracoid process, which happens occasionally, its tendon passes between the bands. The subacromial bursa facilitates movement between the coraco-acromial arch and the subjacent supraspinatus and shoulder joint, functioning as a secondary synovial articulation. When the coraco-acromial ligament is cut, it is impossible to appose the two cut surfaces afterwards: this suggests there is resting tension in the ligament, which forms a ‘tension band’ between the acromial and coracoid processes of the scapula, so ‘pre-tensioning’ both processes against the distracting forces of deltoid and trapezius, and pectoralis minor and the conjoined short head of biceps brachii and coracobrachialis, respectively.</div></section><section><a id="s0230"/><p class="h8hd" id="cesectitle0200">Superior transverse scapular (suprascapular) ligament</p><div class="textfl" id="p0320">The superior transverse scapular (suprascapular) ligament converts the scapular notch into a foramen; it is sometimes ossified.

Since the nerve cannot move aside (it is ‘held’ under the ligament), it can be readily distorted; there is characteristic severe pain, followed by specific atrophy of infraspinatus.

The medial head of triceps is attached to the posterior surface over an elongated triangular area, the apex of which is placed on the medial part of the bone above the level of the lower limit of insertion of teres major. The area widens below and covers the whole surface almost down to the lower end of the bone. The lateral head of triceps is attached to a ridge, sometimes rough, that descends obliquely and laterally above the attachment for the medial head. Above triceps, the axillary nerve and the posterior circumflex humeral vessels wind around the bone on the deep surface of deltoid. Below the attachment of the lateral head of triceps, but above the attachment of the medial head, a shallow groove runs from the upper medial aspect of the surface downwards and laterally towards the lateral border; it contains the radial nerve and its branches, and the profunda brachii vessels.</div><div class="text" id="p0365">The anterolateral surface is bounded by the anterior and lateral borders, and is smooth and featureless in its upper part, which is covered by deltoid. About, or a little above, the middle of this surface, deltoid is attached to the deltoid tubercle. Further distally, the surface gives origin to the lateral fibres of brachialis, which extend upwards into the floor of the lower end of the groove for the radial nerve (see <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0060">Fig. 49.11</a>). The nerve perforates the lateral intermuscular septum close to the bone at the level of the junction of the upper three-fifths and lower two-fifths of the humerus, and enters the anterior compartment of the arm close to the anterolateral surface, between brachialis medially and brachioradialis laterally.</div><div class="text" id="p0370">The anteromedial surface is bounded by the anterior and medial borders. Below the intertubercular sulcus, the rest of the upper half of the surface is smooth and devoid of muscular attachment; its lower half is occupied by the medial part of brachialis (see <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0060">Fig. 49.11A</a>). Coracobrachialis is attached to a long rough strip in the middle third of the medial border, posterior to the brachial neurovascular sheath, which lies in close relation to the humerus in the middle third of this surface. The humeral head of pronator teres is attached to a narrow area close to the lowest part of the medial supracondylar ridge; the ridge itself gives attachment to the medial intermuscular septum of the arm.</div><div class="text" id="p0375">A little below its midpoint, the nutrient foramen, which is directed downwards, opens close to the medial border.

It is curved downwards and forwards, and its pointed apex is connected to the medial border, just above the epicondyle, by a fibrous band, to which part of pronator teres is attached. The foramen completed by this fibrous band usually transmits the median nerve and brachial artery, but sometimes encloses only the nerve, or the nerve plus the ulnar artery (in cases of high division of the brachial artery). A groove that lodges the artery and nerve is usually found posterior to the process.</div></section><section><a id="s0280"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0250">Anterior border</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0380">The anterior border starts on the front of the greater tubercle and runs downwards almost to the lower end of the bone. Its proximal third forms the lateral lip of the intertubercular sulcus and is roughened for muscular attachments. The succeeding portion is also roughened and forms the anterior limit of the deltoid tubercle; the lower half of the border is smooth and rounded.</div></section><section><a id="s0285"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0255">Lateral border</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0385">The lateral border is most conspicuous at the lower end of the bone, where it is thickened to form the lateral supracondylar ridge, and its sharp edge is roughened along its anterior aspect. In its middle and upper thirds, the border is barely discernible, but in a well-marked bone it can be traced upwards to the posterior surface of the greater tubercle. A little above its middle, it is marked by a V-shaped, roughened area: the deltoid tubercle. The limbs of the V are broad; the groove for the radial nerve runs downwards and laterally behind the posterior limb and fades away on the lower part of the anterolateral surface. The lateral intermuscular septum is attached to the lateral border, and is a condensation of the fascia over the lower part of deltoid and the neighbouring brachialis, forming a septum between the anterior and posterior muscular compartments. The septum is most obvious in the lower three-fifths of the arm, and is perforated by the radial nerve and accompanying vessels.</div></section><section><a id="s0290"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0260">Medial border</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0390">The medial border, although rounded, can be identified without difficulty in the lower half of the shaft, where it becomes the medial supracondylar ridge. In its proximal third, the medial border is indistinct until it broadens out to form a triangular area. The lateral border of this area forms the medial lip of the intertubercular sulcus, and the medial border runs upwards as the calcar humerale to the anatomical neck, where it is roughened, with vascular apertures, and forms the area of attachment of the inferior part of the shoulder capsule. In its middle third, the medial border is interrupted by a wide, shallow groove, the radial (spiral) groove that crosses the bone obliquely, passing downwards and forwards from its posterior to its anterior surface.</div></section><section><a id="s0295"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0265">Fractures of the humeral shaft</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0395">Humeral shaft fractures are common; the pattern of the fracture and the displacement of the fragments depend on the force of injury and on the level at which the bone is broken. If there is wide displacement at the time of fracture, closely associated nerves and vessels are at risk of direct injury. Nerves that are ‘fixed’ in relation to the bone and attached septa are at further risk of indirect injury by stretching or, later, by the callus of bone healing.

These factors make sternoclavicular joint dislocation rare; fracture of the clavicular shaft is far more common for the same force directed along the clavicle.

Movements between the clavicle and the disc are more extensive than those between the disc and sternum. The sellar shape of the articular surfaces permits translation or gliding in approximately anteroposterior and vertical planes, with rotation about the long axis of the clavicle. Close-packing coincides with maximum posterior rotation associated with full scapular rotation, i.e. in high elevation of the arm above shoulder height.</div><div class="text" id="p0480">In this position, the tension developed in the anterior sternoclavicular ligament and anterior component of the costoclavicular ligament causes the clavicle to undergo an obligatory posterior translation. It also acts as a check-rein on further rotation and displacement, so protecting the relatively weaker posterior sternoclavicular ligament from overload. Although the function of subclavius is unknown, a consideration of the simple biomechanics of forceful elevation of the arm above shoulder height suggests that this muscle has an important role in decelerating the elevating arm, so protecting the medial ‘clavicular–costal–sternal’ ligamentous structures from recurrent stretching that is likely to accelerate degeneration and injury. The common innervation of the sternoclavicular joint (the deep afferent–mechanoceptor system) and subclavius suggests an intimate functional relationship between these structures. In daily activities, in which the upper limb is used largely in front of the trunk, the sternal end of the clavicle glides on the sternal facet about the fulcrum provided by the costoclavicular ligament. All joints in which polyaxial gliding occurs, producing shear forces (rotation with translation), possess either intra-articular synovial bursae or intra-articular fibrocartilaginous discs; the latter degenerate over time, producing characteristic exophytic degenerative arthritis. In this context, it is interesting that degeneration of the sternoclavicular joint and ossification of the costoclavicular ligaments (claviculocostal synostosis) are almost exclusively found in females above the age of 50 years.</div></section></section></section></section></section></section><a id="s8400"/><section><a id="s0400"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle5810">Acromioclavicular joint</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0485">The acromioclavicular joint is a synovial plane joint and has an intra-articular fibrocartilaginous disc.</div><section><a id="s8425"/><section><a id="s7425"/><section><a id="s6425"/><section><a id="s5425"/><section><a id="s0425"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0350">Articulating surfaces</p><div class="textfl" id="p0490">The articulating surfaces are between the acromial end of the clavicle and the medial acromial margin (<a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0080"><span class="bold">Fig. 49.15</span></a>).

The maximal range of rotation of the clavicle (subtended by the sternoclavicular joint) is 30°; the maximal range of rotation of the scapula (sternoclavicular and acromioclavicular joints combined) is about 60° with respect to the sternum. The scapula is suspended from the distal clavicle at the acromioclavicular joint, which can be considered as the true joint (the cavity bounded by the acromioclavicular capsule and ligaments); it is also part of an extended articulation that comprises the true joint and the coracoclavicular suspensory ligaments. Arguably, the ligaments might be better defined as the claviculocoracoid ligaments, to acknowledge their role as the spiroid fulcrum around which the body of the scapula, and therefore the glenoid fossa, rotate during protraction and retraction of the scapula. The action of subclavius is to resist upward displacement of the distal clavicle, or to decelerate the clavicle moving into elevation. Linear measurements are given in centimetres.</figcaption></figure></div></section><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0095"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000495/main.assets/f49-18-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0095"/><a id="fspara0095"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 49.18</span> The distal clavicle is moved by trapezius, which has an extensive attachment along the spine of the scapula and the medial aspect of the distal third of the clavicle. The antagonist of trapezial power is pectoralis minor, which, rarely, has an extension or slip of tendon that joins the coraco-acromial ligament. The latter acts as a tension band between the ‘outriggers’ of the acromion and coracoid. If surgically divided, the cut surfaces of the coraco-acromial ligament cannot be readily reapposed, suggesting a mechanical role in pre-tensioning the acromion and coracoid against the pull of trapezius. Shortening or tightness of pectoralis minor will create fixed protraction of the scapula, which then rotates ventrally around the chest wall. As a consequence, the acromion tilts and the space between it and the cranial surface of the rotator cuff below (the subacromial space) diminishes, creating the conditions in which forceful coaptation of the apposed surface of the rotator cuff and the coraco-acromial ligament may occur.

If levator scapulae is less active, the scapula rotates laterally (i.e. the inferior angle protracts around the chest wall), with dorsal rotation at the acromioclavicular joint; this is resisted by the rhomboid muscles and controlled by pectoralis minor. If levator scapulae is more active, then the scapula ascends with less rotation. The sternal end of the clavicle, rotating about an anteroposterior axis through the bone above the medial attachment of the costoclavicular ligament, slides down over the articular disc. This is resisted by subclavius and by tension in the costoclavicular ligament and sternoclavicular joint capsule. In scapular depression, ventral rotation occurs at the acromioclavicular joint, and the clavicle slides up on the disc at the sternoclavicular joint. The movements are checked by the cervical fibres of trapezius, the interclavicular and superior sternoclavicular ligaments and the articular disc. Usually, gravity alone is sufficient; when necessary, the lowest part of serratus anterior and pectoralis minor are active depressors.</div></section><section><a id="s0485"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0410">Protraction and retraction</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0570">Protraction (forward movement) round the thoracic wall occurs in pushing, thrusting and reaching movements, usually with some lateral rotation. The acromion advances over the clavicular facet to the limit, and the shoulder is simultaneously advanced by forward movement of the lateral end of the clavicle and posterior translation of its sternal end over the sternal facet, carrying the disc with it. Pectoralis major, together with the anterior sternoclavicular ligament and posterior lamina of the costoclavicular ligament, check backward slide of the sternal end.

This movement is always associated with humeral elevation and rotation at the glenohumeral joint, and with protraction of the scapula. Scapular rotation requires movement at both sternoclavicular and acromioclavicular joints; the sternoclavicular joint permits elevation of the lateral end of the clavicle, a movement that is almost complete when the arm is abducted to 90°. The acromioclavicular joint moves in the first 30° of abduction, when the conoid ligament becomes taut, and is subsequently accompanied by clavicular rotation at the sternoclavicular joint around the longitudinal axis of the bone. The medial end is depressed further as the lateral end continues to rise. Some acromioclavicular movement also occurs in the final stages of humeral abduction. Trapezius (cervical fibres) and serratus anterior (the lower part) are prime movers, with the rhomboids providing resistance to motion.</div><div class="text" id="p0585">Medial (downward) rotation is usually effected by gravity; gradual active lengthening of trapezius and serratus anterior is sufficient to control it.

The rotator cuff muscles are attached to the proximal humerus through a musculotendinous envelope (see below), the deep surface of which fuses with the lateral part of the articular fibrous capsule. The humeral head is then contained in a spherical space bounded medially by the glenoid fossa and elsewhere by the deep surface of the fibrous capsule, a form of osseofibrous acetabulum. The walls of this ‘acetabulum’ (i.e. the rotator cuff muscles and tendons) are contained within a roughly spherical space bounded by the coracoid anteriorly; the coraco-acromial ligament anterosuperiorly; the acromion and spine of the scapula posteriorly, posterosuperiorly and posterolaterally; and the deep surface of deltoid anterolaterally and laterally. This arrangement creates two gliding planes, one internal (the glenohumeral articular gliding plane) and one external (the subcoracoid–subacromial–subdeltoid plane); the latter is continuous with the plane under the scapula (the scapulothoracic gliding plane). Gliding is facilitated by the synovial lined cavities of the glenohumeral joint and the subcoracoid, subacromial and subdeltoid bursae, which are nearly always contiguous. Infection, inflammation and injury commonly cause adhesions and fibrosis (with subsequent contracture) in these planes; restriction of motion follows, specific to the site and extent of adhesion. The surfaces of both gliding planes are extensive and fibrosis is consequently very restricting.</div><section><a id="s0520"/><section><a id="s2480"/><section><a id="s1485"/><section><a id="s3490"/><section><a id="s3495"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0425">Articulating surfaces</p><div class="textfl" id="p0600">The articular surfaces are reciprocally curved and are correctly termed ovoids.

This arrangement can only be the case if the biceps tendon was originally an extra-articular structure and invaginated, with its synovial sheath, into the glenohumeral joint as the upper limb rotated into external rotation relative to the trunk during development.</div></section><section><a id="s0560"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0465">Bursae</p><div class="textfl" id="p0660">Many bursae adjoin the shoulder joint (see <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0080">Figs 49.15</a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0085">49.16</a>).

The subacromial bursa, between deltoid and the capsule, does not communicate with the joint cavity but is prolonged under the acromion and coraco-acromial ligament, and between them and supraspinatus: it appears to be attached, together with the subdeltoid fascia, to the acromion.

Flexion–extension, abduction–adduction, and medial (internal) and lateral (external) rotation all occur at the shoulder. A combination of all of these results in circumduction, which is not a useful movement to record in clinical practice. Although most movement of the shoulder occurs at the glenohumeral joint, the scapulothoracic articulation contributes to overall shoulder movement in all directions, including lateral rotation.</div><div class="text" id="p0685">In the anatomical analysis of shoulder movements, it is usual to relate humeral movement to the scapula, rather than to conventional anatomical planes. However, in clinical practice, movements <span class="italic">are</span> related to the conventional anatomical planes. When the arm hangs at rest, the glenoid fossa faces almost equally forwards and laterally, and the humeral capitular and scapular (topographical) axes correspond, although the humerus, relative to the anatomical position, is medially rotated. With the humerus in the anatomical position, i.e. with the inter-epicondylar axis in the frontal plane, the humeral head axis is posteriorly directed, in line with the axis of the scapula.</div><div class="text" id="p0690">Using the anatomical description, flexion carries the arm anteromedially on an axis through the humeral head orthogonal to the glenoid fossa at its centre. Abduction and adduction occur in a vertical plane orthogonal to that of flexion–extension and the axis is horizontal, through the humeral head and parallel with the glenoid plane. Pure abduction raises the arm anterolaterally in the plane of the scapula. However, when referred to the trunk, flexion and extension occur in the paramedian plane, and abduction and adduction occur in the coronal plane. In this sense, raising the arm vertically from flexion or raising it from abduction are both accompanied by humeral rotation in opposite directions. Whether ‘scapular’ or any other plane of abduction is described, these are selections from an infinite series. In scapular abduction, points on the humeral surface pursue vertical cords, but in rotation, they are horizontal. In ‘pure’ flexion–extension, in a plane orthogonal to the scapula, the axis of movement and the notional ‘mechanical axis’ are regarded as projected from the centre of the glenoid cavity.</div><div class="text" id="p0695">Glenohumeral abduction is about 120° or more (see <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0110">Fig. 49.21B</a>). Abduction may reach 180° after thoracoscapular arthrodesis for facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (<a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495_bib.xhtml#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Copeland and Howard 1978</a>). Abduction is restricted to about 45° after glenohumeral arthrodesis. Some 60° of further abduction occurs at the sterno- and acromioclavicular articulations, and contralateral vertebral flexion also aids in bringing the arm to the vertical. During active elevation, movements at the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints are simultaneous, except in the initial few degrees, when most, often all, movement is glenohumeral. For every 15° of elevation, glenohumeral movement is said to be 10° and scapular movement 5°, but this ratio is not linear throughout the range of motion. During the initial stages of abduction, the entire rotator cuff counteracts the strong upward component of the pull of deltoid, which would otherwise cause the humeral head to slide up the glenoid surface; the additive turning moments exerted by the combined deltoid and supraspinatus force-couple may then abduct the arm. Deltoid also acts with the other elements of the rotator cuff, according to the position of the arm in space, to maintain rotation, flexion and extension of the arm. It is important to consider the synergistic relation between the rotator cuff and deltoid as a continuum in which the rotator cuff muscles act to provide a stable base on which deltoid can work effectively, whatever the position of the arm.</div><div class="text" id="p0700">In flexion, the humerus swings at right-angles to the scapular plane, and scapular rotation cannot increase the elevation (120°) that is obtainable in full flexion. If the fully flexed humerus is also abducted, elevation increases <span class="italic">pro rata</span> until, when the humerus reaches the scapular plane, i.e. when true abduction is reached, 180° of elevation becomes possible. In medial or lateral rotation, the humerus revolves about one-quarter of a circle around a vertical axis; the range is greatest when the arm is pendant, and least when it is vertical. When the rotational range at the glenohumeral joint is assessed, the forearm should be flexed to a right-angle at the elbow in order to prevent the effects of superadded pronation or supination in the pendant limb. In circumduction, which is a succession of the foregoing movements, the distal end of the humerus describes the base of a cone with its apex at the humeral head. This glenohumeral movement may be greatly increased by scapular movements, e.g. in acts of slinging objects with force.</div><div class="text" id="p0705">The peculiar relation of the long head of biceps brachii to the shoulder joint may serve several purposes. By its connection with both the shoulder and elbow, the muscle harmonizes their actions as an elastic connection during all upper limb movements. It helps to prevent the humeral head impinging on the acromion when deltoid contracts and also to steady it in movements of the arm. In paralysis or absence (i.e. in rotator cuff tendon tears) of supraspinatus, the long head of biceps may also help initiate abduction of the arm, particularly when the humerus is laterally rotated.</div><section><a id="s7605"/><section><a id="s8105"/><section><a id="s8605"/><section><a id="s9605"/><section><a id="s0605"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0485">Muscles producing movements</p><div class="textfl" id="p0710">The muscles that produce movements at the glenohumeral joint are principally the scapulohumeral and thoracobrachial muscles: deltoid, pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, assisted by coracobrachialis.

Most dislocations are anterior, and occur when the forearm is forced backwards into greater lateral (external) rotation when it is in abduction, lateral rotation and extension. A dislocated shoulder loses its normal contour because the humeral head is displaced anterior to the glenoid rim and, sometimes, under the coracoid, which means that the acromion process, rather than the greater tubercle, becomes the most lateral bony structure, giving the shoulder a ‘squared-off’ appearance.</div><div class="text" id="p0745">The axillary nerve and vessels may be injured during dislocation or, more commonly, during inexpert attempts at relocation, particularly in older patients. This can lead to an inability to maintain abduction of the shoulder as a result of paralysis of deltoid.

If the patient can initiate, but cannot maintain, abduction beyond 15°, then deltoid palsy should be suspected. Patients, particularly the elderly, can have a rotator cuff rupture and an axillary nerve palsy causing deltoid paralysis; it can be difficult to distinguish between the two. There may also be an area of hypoaesthesia or anaesthesia over the distal part of the muscle (sometimes referred to as the ‘regimental badge patch’ of skin; see <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0015">Fig. 49.2</a>), reflecting loss of function in the upper lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm (a branch of the axillary nerve), as well as venous occlusive changes (swelling) in the limb. After more violent dislocation, younger patients may have deltoid paralysis and an intact, but stretched, rotator cuff or partial tearing of the tendons, with a suprascapular nerve injury; these patients may have unexpected pain in the supraspinous fossa with weakness of infraspinatus (lateral rotation), as well as the anticipated anterior shoulder pain. Posterior dislocation is rare and typically occurs when violent movements produce marked medial rotation and adduction, e.g. in epileptic seizures or electric shock. The upper limb is held in fixed medial rotation, and external rotation is impossible to perform.</div></section></section></section></section></section></section><a id="s0640"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0520">Muscles</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0750">The shoulder girdle and shoulder joint musculature are arranged in layered, functional groups (<a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#t0010"><span class="bold">Table 49.1</span></a>).

Fleshy digitations arise anteriorly from the outer surfaces and superior borders of the upper eight to ten ribs, and from fasciae that cover the intervening intercostal muscles. The line of origin of the muscle is long and slightly curved, and passes inferolaterally around the thorax. There are three parts: the upper fibres arise from the first and second ribs and intercostal fascia, the middle fibres arise from the third to sixth ribs, and the lower fibres interdigitate with the upper five slips of external oblique. The muscle follows the contour of the chest wall closely, reaching the medial border of the scapula anterior to subscapularis. The first (uppermost) digitation encloses, and is attached to, a triangular area of both the costal and the dorsal surfaces of the superior scapular angle. The next two or three digitations form a triangular sheet that is attached to the costal surface along almost its entire medial border.

The upper part, with levator scapulae and the upper fibres of trapezius, suspends the scapula; only slight activity is sufficient to support the unloaded arm. The more extensive lower insertion pulls the inferior scapular angle forwards around the thorax, assisting trapezius in upward rotation of the bone, an action that is essential to raising the arm above the head. In the initial stages of abduction, serratus anterior helps other muscles to fix the scapula, so that deltoid acts effectively on the humerus and not the scapula. While deltoid is raising the arm to a right-angle with the scapula, <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="912" id="pagebreak_912"/><a id="pg912"/>serratus anterior and trapezius are simultaneously rotating the scapula; the combination allows the arm to be raised to the vertical. To effect this upward rotation of the scapula, forward pull on the inferior angle by the lower digitations of serratus anterior is coupled with an upward and medial pull on the lateral end of the clavicle and acromion by the upper fibres of trapezius, and a downward pull on the base of the scapular spine by the lower fibres of trapezius. Conversely, slow downward scapular rotation, assisted by gravity, is achieved by controlled lengthening of these muscles. More powerful downward rotation requires balanced contraction of the upper fibres of serratus anterior, levator scapulae, rhomboids, pectoralis minor and the middle part of trapezius. When weights are carried in front of the body, serratus anterior prevents backward rotation of the scapula. Electromyography shows that serratus anterior is not active in normal human respiration. This may not apply to laboured respiration, e.g. when asthmatics and athletes may be observed to fix the scapula by grasping a rail or other support.</div></section><section><a id="s0790"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0705">Testing</p><div class="textfl" id="p0955">The muscular digitations of serratus anterior can be seen and felt when the outstretched hand pushes against resistance.</div><div class="text" id="p0960">When serratus anterior is paralysed, the medial border of the scapula, and especially its lower angle, stand out prominently.

Pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi are attached to the metaphysis of the humerus below the centre of rotation of the joint, while deltoid and coracobrachialis are attached to the midpoint of the diaphysis or shaft, some way from the centre of rotation of the shoulder joint. These four muscles move the arm in relation to the shoulder joint, so that, although they act through the shoulder joint, their role is to position the elbow joint (and, thus, the hand) in space. The continuous sheet of muscle that is pectoralis major and deltoid positions the elbow through a wide, asymmetrical, conical range of motion from adduction across the trunk with medial rotation, through flexion, abduction and external rotation, into extension at the shoulder. The cervical spinal segmental levels at which this range of movement is represented, C5 and C6, give rise to the anterior division innervation to pectoralis major (thus, pre-axial or predominantly flexor muscles) and the posterior division innervation (thus, post-axial or predominantly extensor muscles) to deltoid. Similarly, coracobrachialis (a flexor and adductor of the abducted arm) is innervated through the anterior division of C5, C6 and (predominantly) C7 segmental levels, while latissimus dorsi is innervated through the posterior division of C6, C7 and C8 (predominantly C7).

The posterior lamina receives fibres from the sixth (and, often, seventh) costal cartilages, sixth rib, sternum, and aponeurosis of external oblique. Costal fibres join the lamina without twisting. Fibres from the sternum and aponeurosis curve around the lower border, turning successively behind those above them, which means that this part of the muscle is twisted so that the fibres that are lowest at their medial origin are highest at their attachment on the humerus. The posterior lamina reaches higher on the humerus than the anterior, and gives off an expansion that covers the intertubercular sulcus and blends with the capsular ligament of the shoulder joint.

In addition, there may be hypoplasia of latissimus dorsi, serratus anterior, external oblique, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, deltoid and the intercostal muscles, and hypoplasia of the hemithorax and ribs. Hypoplasia affecting the arm ranges from syndactyly to symbrachydactyly and ectrodactyly. The second, third and fourth fingers are the most affected; the wrist, forearm, upper arm and scapula are variably involved. There may be ipsilateral breast hypoplasia and absent nipple–areolar complex.</div><div class="text" id="p1030">The aetiology is unclear.

It arises from the anterior border and superior surface of the lateral third of the clavicle, the lateral margin and superior surface of the acromion, and the lower edge of the crest of the scapular spine (other than its smooth, medial, triangular surface) (see <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0130">Figs 49.25</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0140">49.27</a>). The fibres converge inferiorly to a short, substantial tendon that has an extensive attachment which envelops the deltoid tubercle on the lateral aspect of the midshaft of the humerus. Anterior and posterior fibres converge directly to this tendon. The intermediate part is multipennate; four intramuscular septa descend from the acromion to interdigitate with three septa ascending from the deltoid tubercle. The septa are connected by short muscle fibres that provide powerful traction (<a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495_bib.xhtml#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Leijnse et al 2008</a>). The fasciculi are large, producing a coarse longitudinal striation. The muscle surrounds the glenohumeral articulation on all sides, except inferomedially, giving the shoulder its rounded profile.

Different parts of the muscle can act independently, as well as together. Anterior fibres assist pectoralis major in drawing the arm forwards and rotating it medially. Posterior fibres act as external rotators, and act with latissimus dorsi and teres major in drawing the arm backwards (into extension). The posterior fibres of deltoid provide up to 80% of the external rotation power of the arm when elevated into the plane of the scapula. The multipennate, acromial, part of deltoid is a strong abductor; aided by supraspinatus, it abducts the arm until the inferior joint capsule is tight. Movement takes place in the plane of the body of the scapula, which is the only way that scapular rotation can be fully effective in raising the arm above the head. In true abduction, acromial fibres contract strongly, while clavicular and posterior fibres prevent departure from the plane of motion. In the early stages of abduction, traction on the humerus by deltoid would displace the arm upward, but the humeral head is prevented from translating upward by the synergistic centralizing effect of the rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, subscapularis, infraspinatus and teres minor). Electromyography suggests that deltoid contributes little to unresisted medial (internal) or lateral (external) rotation but confirms that it takes part in most other shoulder movements, particularly when resisted, for instance when lifting a weight.</div></section><section><a id="s0905"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0805">Testing</p><div class="textfl" id="p1075">Deltoid can be seen and felt to contract when the arm is abducted against resistance in the scapular plane.

It arises by tendinous fibres from the spines of the lower six thoracic vertebrae anterior to trapezius; from the posterior layer of thoracolumbar fascia, by which it is attached to the spines and supraspinous ligaments of the lumbar and sacral vertebrae; and from the posterior part of the iliac crest. It also springs by muscular fibres from the posterior part (outer lip) of the iliac crest lateral to erector spinae, and by fleshy slips from the three or four lower ribs, interdigitating with external oblique (see <a href="../B9780702077050000604/B9780702077050000604.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 60.2</a>).

The attachment extends higher on the humerus than that of teres major. As the muscle curves round teres major, the fasciculi rotate around each other, so that fibres that originate lowest at the midline insert highest on the humerus, and fibres that originate highest at the midline insert lowest on the humerus.

When the arms are raised above the head, as in climbing, it pulls the trunk upwards and forwards. It takes part in all violent expiratory efforts, such as coughing or sneezing; this is readily confirmed by palpation. Electromyography suggests that latissimus dorsi aids deep inspiration, but it is also active towards the end of forcible expiration, e.g. when blowing a sustained note on a musical instrument. When the arm is elevated, the stretched fibres of latissimus dorsi press on the inferior scapular angle (to which it may also be attached), keeping it in contact with the chest wall.
