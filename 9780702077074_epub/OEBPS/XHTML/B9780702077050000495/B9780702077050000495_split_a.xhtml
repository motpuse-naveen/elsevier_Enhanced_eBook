The term ‘rotator cuff’ is conventionally taken to mean the tendinous parts of the four rotator cuff muscles: subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor. Since teres minor, parts of infraspinatus and most of subscapularis do not have tendons, this use of the term excludes important parts of the rotator cuff apparatus. In this description, the term ‘rotator cuff’ will be used to define the entire musculotendinous apparatus that centralizes the humeral head on the glenoid. The tendons of the rotator cuff will be referred to specifically.</div><div class="text" id="p1165">It is maintained that the inferior capsule of the glenohumeral joint is exposed as a weak part of the capsule, and so predisposed to injury (dislocation). However, in elevation of the arm above 90°, the bulk of teres major forms a muscular buttress to the lower part of the joint and, in this position, clearly draws the humeral head into the glenoid, i.e. it has a centralizing effect. Teres major is a part of the centralizing function of the rotator cuff, and should be considered together with the conventional definition of the rotator cuff.</div><div class="text" id="p1170">The mechanism of the rotator cuff has been likened to that of the fibrous ‘endoskeleton’ of the heart, in which the muscular chambers are constructed around the fibrous architecture of the valvular system, and muscle contraction is centralized on this fibrous support. The muscles of the rotator cuff are attached to their tendons in a similar manner: the fibrous architecture of the tendons provides a framework for the action of the rotator cuff so that it always generates a centralizing force on the glenoid (<a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495_bib.xhtml#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_22">Gagey et al 1993</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1175">The muscles of the rotator cuff combine in three groups (subscapularis and teres major, supraspinatus and infraspinatus, and teres minor) by virtue of their innervation. Subscapularis and teres major are innervated through the subscapular nerves (C5–7, posterior division, posterior cord); supraspinatus and infraspinatus by the suprascapular nerve (C5, C6, upper trunk); and teres minor by the axillary nerve (C5, C6, posterior division, posterior cord). The common origin of their innervation suggests a common final action, namely the generation of the centralizing compression force. In functional terms, supraspinatus and infraspinatus can be considered as one muscle on the grounds that they have the same innervation and the same vascular supply; their attachment to the scapula is a continuum broken only by the spine of scapula for the attachment of trapezius; and their actions are complementary.</div><section><a id="s0995"/><section><a id="s1000"/><h4 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0880">Supraspinatus</h4><section><a id="s1005"/><section><a id="s1810"/><section><a id="s1015"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0885">Attachments</p><div class="textfl" id="p1180">Supraspinatus arises from the medial two-thirds of the supraspinous fossa and from the supraspinous fascia (see <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0145">Fig. 49.28B</a>). The fibres converge, under the acromion, into a thick tendon that passes obliquely through the muscle, crosses above the humeral head, and is attached to the highest facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus. The tendon has a posterior, flatter, component closer to the facet of attachment. The anterior, obliquely directed fibres of supraspinatus are inserted into the anterior aspect of the thick tendon; the more parallel posterior fibres are inserted into both the thick tendon and the flatter component. The thick tendon is contiguous with the transverse humeral and coracohumeral ligaments and forms an anterior pillar to the posterosuperior part of the rotator cuff.

However, there is evidence that both supraspinatus and deltoid are involved throughout the range of abduction, including initiation of the movement. In complete axillary nerve lesions (complete, irreversible deltoid palsy), supraspinatus, acting with other cuff muscles, can initiate, regulate, achieve and maintain full abduction of the arm (although endurance is limited). If supraspinatus is detached, torn or paralysed, and deltoid is also paralysed, investigation and surgical exploration and repair of damaged rotator cuff tendon, muscle or nerve supply is considered important. With a functioning rotator cuff but a compromised deltoid (usually due to axillary nerve palsy) the arm is functionally adept and useful while lacking in endurance. In contrast, when the rotator cuff is functionally compromised (whether due to injury or denervation) but deltoid is normal, arm function is potentially poor because stability of the joint is adversely compromised and deltoid cannot readily function to overcome this disability, unless the diameter of the humeral head is sufficiently great to provide a form of 'pulley' for the (enhanced) action of the deltoid. Supraspinatus helps to stabilize the head of the humerus in the glenoid fossa during movements of the glenohumeral joint and when the arm is dependent, even when moderately loaded, supraspinatus assists deltoid in preventing downward displacement of the humerus.</div></section><section><a id="s1035"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0905">Testing</p><div class="textfl" id="p1200">It is extremely difficult to palpate supraspinatus unless trapezius is thin.

It arises by muscular fibres from the medial two-thirds of the fossa, by tendinous fibres from ridges on its surface and from the deep surface of the infraspinous fascia, by which it is separated from teres major and minor. Its fibres converge to a tendon that glides under the lateral border of the spine of the scapula, and then passes across the posterior aspect of the capsule of the shoulder joint to be attached to the middle facet on the greater tubercle of the humerus. The tendon fuses with that of supraspinatus immediately lateral to the thick lateral margin of the spine of the scapula; the fibres of the tendon decussate so that fibres of infraspinatus can be traced to the facet for supraspinatus, and vice versa (<a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495_bib.xhtml#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Mochizuki et al 2008</a>). The tendon is sometimes separated from the capsule by a bursa that may communicate with the joint cavity. The tendon is flattened, but is thickened in several places, reinforcing its posterior aspect as it attaches to the middle facet. From this region, fibres passing orthogonally within the deeper substance of the tendon of infraspinatus pass forwards into supraspinatus, then pass across the rotator interval to subscapularis. This band of fibres is termed the ‘cable’ (<a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495_bib.xhtml#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Burkhart et al 1993</a>), and it provides the mechanical link between the posterosuperior and anterior parts of the rotator cuff, thus ensuring that there is intrinsic coordination of the rotator cuff mechanism.

The long head helps to check upward translation of the humeral head during contraction of deltoid, in synergy with the action of the rotator cuff. Via the bicipital aponeurosis, it is attached to the posterior border of the ulna, the distal end of which is drawn medially in supination. When the elbow is flexed against resistance, the tendon of insertion and bicipital aponeurosis become conspicuous.</div><div class="text" id="p1495">Lowering the hand under the influence of gravity by extension at the elbow calls for controlled lengthening of biceps brachii. This is an example of a habitual movement in which muscle tension increases despite increasing length. (This is ‘eccentric’ loading of a muscle; during such loading, the muscle–tendon junction is at greater risk of rupture. ‘Concentric’ loading occurs when the muscle shortens as tension increases.) As the hand descends and the elbow extends, the vertical through the centre of gravity of the forearm is carried further from the fulcrum of movement and therefore the turning moment exerted by the load increases and must be matched by an increase in the moment exerted by the muscle.</div></section><section><a id="s1215"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle1055">Testing</p><div class="textfl" id="p1375">With the forearm supinated, biceps brachii can be tested by palpating its fibres during elbow flexion against resistance.</div></section></section></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s8415"/><section><a id="s7415"/><section><a id="s9415"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle8210">Brachialis</h5><section><a id="s6220"/><section><a id="s4220"/><section><a id="s1220"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle1060">Attachments</p><div class="textfl" id="p1380">Brachialis arises from the lower half of the anterior surface of the shaft of the humerus, starting on either side of the insertion of deltoid, and extending distally to within 2.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm of the cubital articular surface.

Initially it is lateral to the radial nerve, posterior to the axillary artery and anterior to subscapularis. At the lower border of subscapularis, it curves back inferior to the humeroscapular articular capsule and, together with the posterior circumflex humeral vessels, traverses a quadrangular space bounded above by subscapularis (anteriorly) and teres minor (posteriorly), below by teres major, medially by the long head of triceps, and laterally by the surgical neck of the humerus. It divides in the space into anterior and posterior branches. The anterior branch curves round the neck of the humerus with the posterior circumflex humeral vessels, deep to deltoid, to reach the anterior part of the muscle. At the level of the anterior border of the acromion, the nerve often consists of two or more thin filaments that supply the anterior deltoid; it gives off a few small cutaneous branches that pierce deltoid and ramify in the skin over its lower part. The posterior branch courses medially and posteriorly along the attachment of the lateral head of triceps, inferior to the glenoid rim.

The nerve to teres minor enters the muscle on its inferior surface. The posterior branch frequently supplies the posterior aspect of deltoid, usually via a separate branch from the main stem, but occasionally from the superior lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm. However, the posterior part of deltoid has a more consistent supply from the anterior branch of the axillary nerve, which should be remembered when performing a posterior deltoid-splitting approach to the shoulder. The upper lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm pierces the deep fascia at the medial border of the posterior aspect of deltoid, and supplies the skin over the lower part of deltoid and the upper part of the long head of triceps. The posterior branch is intimately related to the inferior aspects of the glenoid and shoulder joint capsule. There is often an enlargement or pseudoganglion on the branch to teres minor.

All too often, rupture of the axillary nerve is not recognized until deltoid is atrophied, long past the ideal time for repair. The widely held view that deltoid is the abductor of the shoulder is erroneous. Deltoid provides power and stamina, and abduction is initiated and maintained by the suprascapular nerve, acting through supra- and infraspinatus, their tendons and attachments. Disruption of any component of this abductor mechanism interferes with or precludes abduction. <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495_bib.xhtml#bib46" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_46">Wynn Parry (1981)</a> treated 145 patients in whom paralysis was confined to deltoid. The range of abduction was full or nearly so, and a system of training enabled most patients to return to full military duties. He wrote: ‘It must be stressed that these movements providing full abduction and elevation are not trick movements, in the sense usually associated with this word; all the muscles involved normally help to abduct the shoulder. The scapulohumeral rhythm is quite normal and in the later stages of re-education the patient does not even need to rotate the humerus externally to initiate movement.’Seddon (1975) was a little more cautious, finding abduction to about 155° was more usual. The ISHA is diminished by about 20° in uncomplicated ruptures of the axillary nerve when there is no stiffness of the shoulder.</div><section><a id="s1625"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle1430">Axillary nerve</h6><div class="textfl" id="p1820">The axillary nerve innervates deltoid. Although a good range of elevation is usually maintained by an intact abductor mechanism, strength and stamina are greatly reduced. Early diagnosis of rupture of the axillary nerve can prove difficult; the nerve is deeply seated, which means that Tinel's sign is rarely detectable. Active movement is restricted by pain and by the restraint of any sling. The loss of sensation varies and there may not be complete anaesthesia. Patients with an intact suprascapular nerve and an intact rotator cuff are able to initiate abduction and many can fully elevate the arm, or nearly so. The power of forward flexion and of abduction is reduced to, at most, 30–40% of normal, whereas extension, with the shoulder at 90° of abduction, is 10% or less. One useful test is to palpate the posterior third of deltoid with the fingers and ask the patient to move the elbow gently backwards. It should be possible to detect activity in the muscle when the arm is supported in a sling or by the examiner's arm.</div></section><section><a id="s3630"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle1435">Suprascapular nerve</h6><div class="textfl" id="p1950">The suprascapular nerve is essential for abduction and lateral rotation at the glenohumeral joint. When the nerve or the rotator cuff is torn, or both are injured, the ISHA is so reduced that the patient is unable to move the arm away from the body.

The anterior group of four or five nodes spreads along the inferior border of pectoralis minor near the lateral thoracic vessels. Their afferents drain the skin and muscles of the supra-umbilical anterolateral body wall and breast, and their efferents pass partly to the central and partly to the apical axillary nodes. The posterior group of six or seven nodes lie on the inferior margin of the posterior axillary wall, along the subscapular vessels. Their afferents drain the skin and superficial muscles of the inferior posterior region of the neck and the dorsal aspect of the trunk down to the iliac crest, and their efferents pass to the apical and central axillary nodes. A central group of three or four large nodes embedded in axillary fat receives afferents from all preceding groups, and their efferents drain to the apical nodes. An apical group of six to twelve nodes is partly posterior to the superior part of pectoralis minor and partly above its superior border, extending to the apex of the axilla medial to the axillary vein. The only direct territorial afferents are those that accompany the cephalic vein and/or some that drain the upper peripheral region of the breast; the group drains all the other axillary nodes. Their efferents unite as the subclavian trunk and drain directly to either the jugulosubclavian venous junction, the subclavian vein, the jugular lymphatic trunk or (occasionally) to a right lymphatic duct; the left trunk usually ends in the thoracic duct (see <a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355.xhtml#f0085">Fig. 35.16</a>).

One or two infraclavicular nodes appear beside the cephalic vein in the groove between pectoralis major and deltoid, just inferior to the clavicle. Their efferents pass through the clavipectoral fascia to the apical axillary nodes. Occasionally, some pass anterior to the clavicle to the inferior deep cervical (supraclavicular) nodes.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0205"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000495/main.assets/f49-40-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0205"/><a id="fspara0205"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 49.48</span> Lymph nodes and vessels associated with the left axilla.
