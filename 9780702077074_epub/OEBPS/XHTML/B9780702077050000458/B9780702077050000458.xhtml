The anterior segment, part of the smaller sphere, is formed by the transparent cornea and accounts for approximately 7% of the ocular surface. The posterior segment of the eyeball is part of the larger sphere formed externally by the opaque sclera (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 45.1</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000458/main.assets/f45-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 45.1</span> The left eye and part of the lower eyelid in horizontal section, viewed from above.

The internal surface of the choroid is covered by the photosensory retina, which terminates anteriorly at the ora serrata; the latter also marks the junction between the ciliary body and choroid. The vasculature of the choroid supplies nutrients to the avascular outer retina.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="791" id="pagebreak_791"/><a id="pg791"/></div><div class="text" id="p0020">The ocular lens is located immediately behind the iris and is suspended from the ciliary body via zonular fibres (suspensory ligament) (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 45.1</a>). Smooth muscles within the ciliary body regulate the tension exerted on the elastic lens and hence determine its shape, thereby adjusting the focus of the eye in the process of accommodation. The iris, which does not allow the transmission of light due to a heavily pigmented posterior surface, also contains smooth muscle, allowing it to regulate the size of the pupillary aperture.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">The iris and lens separate the eye into three chambers. The largest, the vitreous chamber, is filled with the gel-like vitreous humour, and lies posterior to the lens, comprising about two-thirds of the volume of the eye (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 45.1</a>). The spaces between the lens and iris, and the iris and cornea, are, respectively, the posterior and anterior chambers of the eye. Both are filled with aqueous humour, which is produced by the epithelium of the ciliary body, travels through the pupil, circulates in the anterior chamber and is drained principally through the canal of Schlemm at the iridocorneal filtration angle. Aqueous humour provides metabolic support to the avascular lens and cornea.</div><div class="text" id="p0030">The sole purpose of the eyes and their associated structures within the bony orbit is to form a good image on a healthy retina. The photoreceptors of the retina transduce the optical radiation into neurobiological activity and other cells within the retina then begin to process the output of the photoreceptors. The retinal signal is transferred via the optic nerve, along the visual pathway (see Fig. 45.32) to various regions within the brain, where further processing results in visual perception.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Outer Coat</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0035">The fibrous outer coat of the eye consists of the opaque posterior sclera and the transparent anterior cornea. Together they form a semi-elastic protective covering enclosing the eye, which, when made turgid by intraocular pressure, determines the optical geometry of the eye and ensures its shape is not distorted when it moves. The sclera also provides attachments for the extraocular muscles, and its smooth external surface rotates easily on the adjacent tissues of the orbit when these muscles contract (<a href="../B9780702077050000446/B9780702077050000446.xhtml">Ch. 44</a>). The opacity of the sclera helps ensure that only light that enters the eye through the pupil reaches the retina. The cornea, on the other hand, not only admits light but also its covering tear film is the major refractive surface of the eye.</div><section><a id="s0015"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0025">Sclera</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0040">The sclera accounts for approximately 93% of the outer coat of the eye. Anteriorly, it is continuous with the cornea at the corneoscleral junction, known as the limbus (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 45.1</a>). It is punctured by a number of foramina containing nerves and blood vessels, most notably the optic foramen, which lies 3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm medial to the midline and 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm below the horizontal and houses the optic nerve. Smaller openings contain anterior ciliary arteries that penetrate anteriorly, vortex veins that cross the sclera equatorially, and the long and short ciliary nerves and arteries that enter posteriorly. There is considerable individual variation in scleral dimensions; for example, it is often thicker in males. The sclera is thickest at the posterior pole (just less than 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm) and decreases anteriorly, reaching a minimum equatorially at about half this thickness, before increasing somewhat on approaching the limbus. It also thins approaching the optic nerve. The sclera is thinner when the eye is elongated in myopia.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">The external surface of the sclera is covered by a delicate episcleral lamina of loose fibrovascular tissue, which contains blood vessels and is in contact with the inner surface of the fascial sheath of the eyeball. Anteriorly, the external scleral surface is covered by conjunctiva, which is reflected onto it from the posterior surfaces of the eyelids. The scleral internal surface adjacent to the choroid is attached to it by a delicate fibrous layer, the suprachoroid lamina, which contains numerous fibroblasts and melanocytes. Anteriorly, the inner sclera is attached to the ciliary body by the lamina supraciliaris. Posteriorly, at the optic nerve, the outer half of the sclera turns back to become continuous with the dura mater, while the inner half is modified to form a perforated plate, the lamina cribrosa sclerae. The optic nerve fascicles pass through these minute orifices, while the central retinal artery and vein pass through a larger, central aperture. The lamina cribrosa sclerae is the weakest part of the sclera and bulges outwards (a cupped disc) when intraocular pressure is raised chronically, as in glaucoma.</div><div class="text" id="p0050">Like the cornea, the scleral stroma is composed mainly of densely packed collagen embedded in a matrix of proteoglycans, which are mixed with occasional elastic fibres and fibroblasts. However, in contrast to the cornea, scleral collagen fibrils show a large variation in diameter and spacing, and the lamellae branch and interlace extensively. This arrangement of fibres results in increased light scatter, which is responsible for the opaque, dull-white appearance of the sclera, and imparts a high tensile strength to the sclera to resist the pull of the extraocular muscles and contain the intraocular pressure. Collagen fibre bundles are arranged circumferentially around the optic disc and the orifices of the lamina cribrosa. The fibres of the tendons of the recti intersect scleral fibres at right-angles at their attachments, and then interlace deeper in the sclera. Although the sclera acts as a conduit for blood vessels, scleral vessels are few and mainly disposed in the episcleral lamina, especially close to the limbus. Its sensory nerve supply is surprisingly rich, accounting for the intense pain associated with scleral inflammation (<a href="#bib56" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_56">Watson and Young 2004</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0055">A forward pointing ridge of scleral tissue, the scleral spur, lies between the anterior ciliary body and the posterior edges of the canal of Schlemm and trabecular meshwork (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Figs 45.2</span></a>, <a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">45.3A</span></a>).

The trabecular meshwork is continuous anteriorly with Descemet's membrane and the endothelium of the cornea. Aqueous humour filters from the anterior chamber through interconnected spaces among loose trabecular fibres, most of which are attached to the anterior, external aspect of the scleral spur. Of the remainder, most are continuous with longitudinal fibres of the ciliary muscle, some of which attach to the posterior internal aspect of the scleral spur. The trabecular meshwork provides sufficient resistance to aqueous humour outflow to <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="792" id="pagebreak_792"/><a id="pg792"/>generate an intraocular pressure of approximately 15<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mmHg. It also acts as a filter and has the capacity to phagocytose particulate matter.</div><div class="text" id="p0070">The canal of Schlemm (sinus venosus sclerae) is an anular endothelial canal located near the internal surface of the sclera close to the limbus. In cross-section, the canal appears as an oval cleft, with an outer wall that grooves the sclera. Posteriorly, it extends as far as the anterior edge of the scleral spur. The canal of Schlemm may be double or multiple in parts of its course, and its walls are constructed of a continuous single thin endothelial layer. Passage of aqueous humour to the canal probably occurs via giant pinocytotic vacuoles and associated transcellular pores, which form on the inner face of the endothelium and discharge into the canal at the outer face. Aqueous humour passes through a plexus of fine intrascleral vessels that connect the canal of Schlemm with episcleral veins (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 45.4</span></a>). Normally, the canal does not contain blood; pressure gradients prevent the reflux of blood, even though the channels between the canal and veins have no valves. However, in venous congestion, blood may enter the canal; the continuous endothelial outer wall of the canal prevents further reflux.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0025"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000458/main.assets/f45-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0025"/><a id="fspara0025"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 45.4</span> Tissues of the filtration angle in section.

Aqueous humour drains from the anterior chamber at T through the trabecular meshwork into the canal of Schlemm, from where it flows through collector channels, either to the intrascleral venous plexus, where it mixes with blood from the ciliary venous plexus, or directly to the surface tissues of the eye as an aqueous vein. The aqueous vein is shown joining an episcleral vein at the surface to form a laminated vessel. Aqueous and blood drain posteriorly in episcleral veins, which, in turn, join anterior ciliary veins.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0075">An alternative route for aqueous outflow, the uveoscleral pathway, has been described (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Fautsch and Johnson 2006</a>, <a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_28">Goel et al 2010</a>). Estimates of aqueous drained by this route in humans vary from under 5% to as much as 54% (<a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_1">Alm and Nilsson 2009</a>). Since there is no epithelial barrier between the anterior chamber and the ciliary body, aqueous humour is able to enter the loose connective tissue in front of the ciliary muscle and pass between the muscle fibres into the supraciliary and suprachoroidal spaces, where it can be absorbed by vessels that drain the uvea. Clinically, aqueous outflow via this route can be increased by topical prostaglandin analogues, which are first-line therapy for the treatment of open angle glaucoma.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">Any interference with the drainage of aqueous increases intraocular pressure and may lead to glaucoma, which can be either ‘primary’, or secondary to a specific ocular anomaly or disease. Primary glaucoma can be either ‘closed angle’, where the filtration angle is narrowed by the proximity of the iris root to the cornea, or, more commonly ‘open angle’, where aqueous access to angle tissues is unimpeded. In the most common form of primary open angle glaucoma, age-related pathological changes within the trabecular meshwork reduce the facility of aqueous drainage, thus raising intraocular pressure (<a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_26">Gabelt and Kaufman 2005</a>). Sustained raised pressure leads to progressive defects in the visual field, because of either direct mechanical damage to retinal ganglion cell axons (particularly at the optic nerve head), or impairment of the optic nerve head blood supply, or both.</div><div class="text" id="p0085">Differences in drainage angle morphology most probably underlie variations in the prevalence of primary angle closure glaucoma (<a href="#bib53" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_53">Wang et al 2012</a>); drainage through both the canal of Schlemm and the uveoscleral pathway is decreased in old age.

Anteriorly, the ridged pars plicata (corona ciliaris) surrounds the base of the iris and accounts for about one-third of the ciliary body. Posteriorly, the relatively smooth and thin pars plana (orbiculus ciliaris) lies adjacent to the ora serrata and forms a convenient access point for instruments during vitreoretinal surgery and for intraocular injection. The whole ciliary body is covered internally by a double epithelium, in which the inner layer is unpigmented, while the outer layer contains melanin. At the ora serrata, the retinal pigment epithelium is continuous with the outer pigmented epithelium of the pars plana, while the neural retina is replaced by inner unpigmented ciliary epithelium (see <a href="#f0130">Fig. 45.24</a>). Anteriorly, this double epithelium continues over the pars plicata until it merges with the double epithelium on the posterior surface of the iris (where the inner layer of cells also accumulates melanin). The anterior pars plicata is ridged meridionally by 70–80 ciliary processes radiating from the base of the iris (see <a href="#f0050">Figs 45.9</a>–<a href="#f0055">45.10</a>). In the young eye, these process are approximately parallel-sided structures, but in the adult, their flanks become less regular and appear thicker. A minor ridge, or ciliary plica, lies in the valley between most of the processes. The crests of the processes are less pigmented, giving them the appearance of light striae, from which the name ciliary is derived. The zonular fibres attached to the lens extend into the valleys between the ciliary processes and pass beyond them to fuse with the basal lamina of the superficial epithelial layer of pars plana. Their sites of attachment are marked by striae that pass back from the valleys of the pars plicata, across the pars plana, almost as far as the apices of the dentate processes of the ora serrata (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 45.9</a>).</div><section><a id="s0100"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0110">Ciliary epithelium</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0245">The ciliary epithelium consists of two layers of cells that are derived embryonically from the two layers of the optic cup.

These cells contain little or no pigment. The outer layer of the ciliary epithelium, in contrast, contains cuboidal cells that are loaded with melanin. Normally, the two layers are firmly united, but fluid may separate them pathologically. The pigment layer is attached to the stroma of the ciliary body by its basal lamina, which continues back into the basal lamina of the choroid.

On accommodation, the ciliary muscle contracts, moving the ciliary body forwards and inwards towards the optic axis. All parts of the muscle act in concert and tension on the zonular fibres is relaxed. As the lens is covered by an elastic capsule, once tension on it is released, it assumes a more convex shape suitable for focusing closer objects.

When pigment is largely absent, other than in the posterior epithelial layers (the condition at birth), the iris is light blue. Those with dark irises are not only less likely to be dazzled by bright light, they also have a lower corneal sensitivity to chemical irritants, and mydriatic drugs are less effective.

The dilator is supplied with sympathetic, non-myelinated, postganglionic fibres from the superior cervical ganglion whose routes are less well established. An additional small fraction of nerve endings in the dilator and sphincter muscles have been identified as parasympathetic and sympathetic, respectively, in experimental animal studies, including those on primates. The nerve fibres form plexuses within the iris, from which fibres extend to innervate the two muscles, the vessels and the anterior border layer; some fibres may be afferent (trigeminal) and others are vasomotor.</div><section><a id="s0165"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0175">Pupillary light reflex</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0340">In young adults pupillary diameter normally varies from around 2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm when fully constricted (miosis) in bright light to at least 8<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm when dilated in darkness (mydriasis), and has an even wider range under the influence of drugs.

Variations in pupil area in different light levels (maximally a factor of 16) will obviously affect the amount of light impinging on the retina. However, compared to the total range of illumination within which humans can maintain some degree of vision (approximately 10 log units), this effect, though important, is small. Most mechanisms for dark/light adaptation are retinal, and neural or biochemical in nature. Enhancing visual acuity by restricting light to the centre of the lens, and thereby decreasing the amount of spherical aberration, is at least as important a function of pupillary constriction.</div><div class="text" id="p0345">If only one eye is illuminated, the pupil of that eye constricts (direct response), as does the pupil of the contralateral, unilluminated, eye (consensual response). While change in pupillary diameter is usually considered a reflex response to changes in light level, the pupil also constricts on viewing near objects and in response to painful stimuli; it can also be influenced by more complex cortical factors.</div><div class="text" id="p0350">In pupillary constriction, light acting on both traditional retinal photoreceptors (rods and cones) and on intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (<a href="#pg807">p. 807</a>) gives rise to activity in retinal ganglion cells that is conducted along the optic nerve, through the optic chiasma and along the optic tract. Although the majority of tract fibres end in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (see Fig. 45.32), a small number leave the optic tract before it reaches the thalamus, at the superior brachium, and synapse in the olivary pretectal nucleus. The information is relayed from the pretectal nucleus by short neurones that synapse bilaterally on preganglionic parasympathetic neurones in the Edinger–Westphal nucleus (in the oculomotor nerve complex in the rostral midbrain). Efferent impulses pass along parasympathetic fibres carried by the oculomotor nerve to the orbit, where they synapse in the ciliary ganglion. Postganglionic fibres travel in the short ciliary nerves to the sphincter pupillae, which reduces the size of the pupil when it contracts (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 45.12</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0355">Pupillary dilation is brought about by lessening the parasympathetic drive to the sphincter (see above) and by sympathetic activation of the dilator. Sympathetic preganglionic fibres arise from neurones in the intermediolateral cell column in segments C8–T2 of the spinal cord, a region termed the ciliospinal center of Budge (and Waller), and pass via the sympathetic trunk to the superior cervical ganglion. Postganglionic neurones travel up the neck next to the internal carotid artery as the internal carotid nerve; at the level of the cavernous sinus, the nerve breaks up to form an interweaving network of fibres, the carotid plexus, around the carotid artery. Some of the axons from the plexus form the sympathetic root of the ciliary ganglion, passing through the ciliary ganglion without synapsing (see <a href="../B9780702077050000446/B9780702077050000446.xhtml#f0110">Fig. 44.18</a>), and innervating the iris dilator via short ciliary nerves travelling within the choroid. Other postganglionic sympathetic fibres bypass the ciliary ganglion and reach the dilator in long ciliary nerves, which are branches of the nasociliary nerve. Neurones supplying the long and short ciliary nerves enter the orbit by the superior orbital fissure (<a href="../B9780702077050000446/B9780702077050000446.xhtml">Ch. 44</a>).

On reaching the attached root of the iris, both long ciliary arteries divide into an upper and a lower branch. The branches anastomose with the corresponding contralateral arteries, and with the anterior ciliary arteries, to form the major iridic circle (circulus arteriosus major) at the base of the iris (see <a href="#f0070">Figs 45.13</a>–<a href="#f0075">45.14</a>). Vessels converge from this circle towards the free margin of the iris, where they form loops and become veins. At the level of the collarette, arteries and veins anastomose to form an incomplete minor iridic circle (circulus arteriosus minor). The smaller arteries and veins are very similar in their structure and are often slightly helical when the pupil is dilated, allowing them to adapt to changes in iridial shape as the pupil varies in size. All of the vessels, including the capillaries, have a non-fenestrated endothelium and a prominent, often thick, basal lamina. There is no elastic lamina in the arteries or veins, and there are few smooth muscle cells, especially in the veins.

At least three varieties coexist – α, β and γ, their relative proportions changing throughout life. They have very high concentrations and form up to 60% of the lens fibre mass, giving these cells a higher protein content than any other bodily tissue. Variations in their concentration in different parts of the lens give rise to regional differences in refractive index, correcting for the spherical and chromatic aberrations which might otherwise be the case in a homogeneous lens.</div><div class="text" id="p0440">Lens transparency is largely the result of the regular packing of crystallins within its fibres, as well as the avascularity of the lens and the absence of fibre organelles. Apart from transmitting the visible spectrum, the lens also serves to prevent potentially damaging UVA radiation from reaching the retina using a variety of chromophores such as various kynurenine derivatives. Shorter wavelengths (UVB) are removed by the cornea. At birth, the lens is colourless and transmits all wavelengths from the infra-red to the near-ultraviolet well. However, throughout life, due largely to post-translational modification of its proteins, the amount of short wavelength radiation transmitted diminishes until, in old age, the lens takes on an amber tinge as it absorbs visible radiation too, decreasing blue sensitivity in older people. In cataract, these changes are more pronounced. Lens fluorescence also increases with age, reducing contrast of the retinal image (<a href="#bib58" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_58">Zelentsova et al 2017</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0205"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0215">Ocular refraction</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0445">Refraction takes place when light is obliquely incident on the interface between media of different refractive indices. Approximately two-thirds (40 dioptres) of the total refractive power of the unaccommodated eye is effected by the tear film covering the curved cornea, as its refractive index is similar to that of water (1.333), while that of air is close to unity. The remaining approximately 20 dioptres of the eye’s power is the result of refraction by the lens, whose refractive index varies from 1.386 at its periphery to 1.406 at its core, which is higher than that of the surrounding media. The main value of the lens is its ability to vary its dioptric power during the process of accommodation, allowing an increase in refraction of 12 dioptres when viewing close objects in the young. This decreases with age, being halved at 40 years and reduced to one dioptre or less at 60 years (presbyopia).</div><section><a id="s0210"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0220">Disorders of refraction</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0450">An unaccommodated eye is said to be emmetropic when the refracting structures are so related to its length that the retina receives a focused image of a distant object. Although the majority of eyes are emmetropic, a large, and increasing, minority have errors of refraction (ametropia) that can take three different forms. In myopia, the eye is too long for its refractive power and distant objects are focused in front of the retina when relaxed; closer objects will be in focus and, consequently, the eye is said to be ‘short-sighted’. Conversely, in hyperopia (long sight), the eye is too short for its refractive power and, when it is relaxed, distant objects are focused behind the retina. In astigmatism, the refractive power of the eye is not the same in different meridians, which are approximately 90° apart in regular astigmatism.</div><div class="text" id="p0455">Normally, emmetropia is assured during development both by the active control of the sclera's biomechanical and biochemical properties and changes in the optical features of the eye's refractive elements, a process known as emmetropization (<a href="#bib51" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Wallman and Winawer 2004</a>). A resting focal plane behind the retina results in scleral growth causing axial elongation of the globe until the focused image and the position of the retina are coincident. On the other hand, light focused in front of the retina retards scleral growth, reducing axial length. In ametropia, this process fails.</div><div class="text" id="p0460">The causes of refractive errors such as myopia are both genetic and environmental. Not only have several candidate genes been identified, but also factors such as increased near work and lack of outdoor activity have all been linked to myopia (<a href="#bib51" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Wallman and Winawer 2004</a>, <a href="#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_24">Flitcroft 2013</a>). This has led to a recent increase in the incidence of myopia to epidemic proportions, with a prevalence of over 80% in the adult population of some East Asian cities (<a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_44">Rose et al 2008</a>). Fortunately, errors of refraction are amenable to correction using spectacle or contact lenses and by various forms of refractive surgery.</div><div class="text" id="p0465">As noted above, the ability to change the power of the lens through accommodation diminishes during the fifth decade to an extent that neither the corrected ametrope nor the emmetrope is able to focus near objects clearly, and reading spectacles become necessary. Many factors could potentially result in such loss of accommodation, but it seems likely that the main cause is the continued growth of the lens, rather than a reduced ability of the ciliary muscle to contract (<a href="#bib48" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_48">Strenk et al 2005</a>). This is offset to a very limited extent by the reduction of the pupil aperture with age, which increases the depth of focus but at the cost of creating the further problem of requiring greater illumination.</div><div class="text" id="p0470">Other errors of refraction are the concomitants of eye disease, especially those that affect the cornea. Corneal curvature, for example, may be sufficiently altered as a residual defect of past disease to cause irregular astigmatism. In keratoconus, the cornea is thinned and steepened centrally, distorting the refracting surface. A dislocated lens, caused, for example, by Marfan syndrome, also disrupts the refractive status of the eye.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0215"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0225">Vitreous humour</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0475">The vitreous humour occupies about four-fifths of the eyeball.

Its anterior surface is hollowed into a deep concavity, the hyaloid fossa, fitting the shape of the lens (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 45.1</a>). It is colourless, consisting of approximately 99% water, but is not entirely structureless. At its perimeter (cortex), it has a gel-like consistency (100–300<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm thick); nearer the centre, it contains a more liquid zone. Hyaluronan, in the form of long glycosaminoglycan chains, fills the whole vitreous. In addition, the vitreous contains a random loose network of type II collagen fibrils, which are densest in the cortex and occasionally grouped into fibres. The cortex also contains scattered cells, hyalocytes, which possess the characteristics of mononuclear phagocytes and may contribute to the production of hyaluronan. Normally in a resting state, they can be actively phagocytic in inflammatory conditions. Hyalocytes are not present in the cortex bordering the lens.</div><div class="text" id="p0480">The liquid vitreous is absent at birth, appears first at 4 or 5 years, and increases to occupy half the vitreous space by the seventh decade. Vitreous liquefaction results in an increased incidence of posterior vitreous detachment and associated floaters in the elderly. The cortex is most dense at the pars plana of the ciliary body adjacent to the ora serrata, where attachment is strongest, and this is often referred to as the vitreous base. Elsewhere, the vitreous also has a firm (peripapillary) attachment at the edge of the optic disc. The adherence of the vitreous to the retina can result in traction on the retina if the vitreous shrinks, such as happens in old age, producing macular holes or peripheral breaks, possibly leading to retinal detachment.</div><div class="text" id="p0485">A narrow hyaloid canal runs from the optic nerve head to the central posterior surface of the lens (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 45.1</a>).

Photoreceptors synaptically contact each other and bipolar and horizontal cells in the outer plexiform layer (layer 5), while bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cells synapse in the inner plexiform layer (layer 7). The axons of ganglion cells run towards the optic disc in the nerve fibre layer (layer 9), where they leave the retina as the optic nerve, which transmits the retinal output to the visual areas of the brain where visual processing is completed. Although most neural activity flows from the photoreceptors towards the brain, some information flow takes place in the opposite direction via centripetal fibres in the optic nerve and interplexiform cells in the retina that connect the inner and outer plexiform layers.</div><div class="text" id="p0520">The classic 10-layered appearance of the retina is absent in the optic nerve head, the fovea and foveola, and the ora serrata.

At the ora serrata, where the retina borders the ciliary body (see <a href="#f0055">Fig. 45.10</a>), the retinal pigment epithelium merges with the outer pigmented epithelium of the ciliary body, while the neural retina borders the inner unpigmented ciliary epithelium; the retina is thinnest at this point.

The retinal pigment epithelium is required for the regeneration of bleached visual pigment and may have antioxidant properties. It also secretes a variety of growth factors necessary for the integrity of the choriocapillaris endothelium and the photoreceptors and produces a number of immunosuppressive factors.

These form as deep infoldings of the plasma membrane at the base of the outer segment; they ‘bud off’ after formation so that the discs are not attached to the plasma membrane and are free-floating within the outer segment. Cone outer segments are generally shorter and, as their name implies, often conical (especially in the peripheral retina).

Such rhodopsins have a smooth, bell-shaped absorption profile with a point of maximum absorbance (λ<sub>max</sub>), indicating the wavelength at which they are most sensitive. Humans possess four different opsins, resulting in four spectrally distinct visual pigments: one located within the rods (λ<sub>max</sub> 498<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>nm) and three within different populations of cones absorbing maximally at the short (λ<sub>max</sub> 420<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>nm), middle (λ<sub>max</sub> 534<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>nm) and longer (λ<sub>max</sub> 563<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>nm) wavelength end of the visible spectrum.

Golgi staining has identified nine distinct types of bipolar cell in the human retina (<a href="#bib32" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Kolb et al 1992</a>), eight of which contact cones exclusively, and the remaining type synapses only on rods.</div><div class="text" id="p0600">Cone bipolars are of three major morphological types: midget, S (blue) cone and diffuse, according to their connectivity and size. Midget cone bipolar cells either invaginate the cone pedicle or synapse on its base (flat subtype). In the central retina, each midget bipolar cell contacts only a single cone (2–3 in the periphery), forming part of a one-to-one channel from cone to ganglion cell that mediates high spatial resolution. S cones form part of a short-wavelength mediating channel, while the larger diffuse cone bipolars are connected to up to 10 cones and are thought to signal luminosity rather than colour.</div><div class="text" id="p0605">Cone bipolar cells can also be of two physiological types, according to their response to the light-induced decrease in glutamate release from the photoreceptors to which they are synaptically connected. If illumination of the photoreceptors with a point of light causes a depolarization of the connected bipolar cell, it is said to be an ‘ON’ bipolar, contacting the cone by ‘sign-inverting’ synapses with metabotropic receptors. However, if cones are connected to an ‘OFF’ bipolar cell via ‘sign-conserving’ synapses with ionotropic receptors, illumination of the photoreceptor will result in hyperpolarization of the bipolar cell. Illumination of a concentric area of surrounding photoreceptors causes the opposite response in bipolar cells to illumination within their dendritic field.

They are probably also responsible for some of the complex forms of image analysis known to take place within the retina, such as directional movement detection. Up to 24 different morphological types of amacrine cell are recognized in humans (<a href="#bib32" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Kolb et al 1992</a>); coupled to their neurochemical complexity, this makes them perhaps the most diverse neural cell type in the body.</div></section><section><a id="s0260"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0270">Interplexiform cells</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0630">Interplexiform cells, often regarded as a subclass of amacrine cells, generally have cell bodies in the inner nuclear layer.

Midget ganglion cells (P cells) contact only single midget bipolar cells in the central retina, which, in turn, connect to single cones, giving each cone a ‘private line’ out of the retina and ensuring optimal acuity. The large dendritic field of parasol cells (M cells) is consistent with a role in motion detection. Parasol and midget ganglion cells together make up around 80% of human retinal ganglion cells. The remaining cells (approximately 200,000) project to the superior colliculus of the midbrain, the thalamic pulvinar, the pretectum and the accessory optic system, and contribute to various subconscious visual reflexes such as the pupillary and accommodation responses (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 45.12</a>).

Apically, each central process terminates at the external limiting membrane, from which microvilli project for a short distance into the space between the rod and cone inner segments (fibre baskets) (see <a href="#f0135">Fig. 45.25</a>).

One function of macular pigment is to protect the photoreceptors from photo-oxidative damage; it has been hypothesized that low levels may be associated with retinal pathologies such as age-related macular degeneration (<a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Lima et al 2016</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0695">The increased packing density of cones in the foveola and their lack of convergence with ganglion cells, combined with the absence of the inner retinal layers, including blood vessels, from the central macula (reducing light scatter), collectively ensure that visual resolution is highest in this part of the retina.

Although similar retinal veins unite to form the central retinal vein, the courses of the arteries and veins do not correspond exactly. These vessels mainly run within the nerve fibre and ganglion cell layers of the retina, a course that accounts for their clarity when seen through an ophthalmoscope (see <a href="#f0110">Fig. 45.20A</a>), and explains why they can serve as an easily accessible indicator of cardiovascular disease. Arteries often cross veins, usually lying superficial to them; in severe hypertension, the arteries may press on the veins and cause visible dilations distal to these crossings. The vitreal location of arteries, their lighter, bright red coloration and smaller diameter in comparison to veins allow the two vessel types to be distinguished ophthalmoscopically.

Most axons arising from the nasal half of a line bisecting the fovea within each retina cross in the chiasma to enter the contralateral optic tract. Fibres from the temporal hemi-retinas do not generally cross in the chiasma. Classically, the axons within the optic tract were thought to maintain their topographic order and each tract was assumed to be a single representation of the contralateral hemifield. However, it is now clear that axons are mainly organized in functional groupings, larger superficial axons representing the magnocellular pathway and deeper axons originating from midget ganglion cells and forming the parvocellular pathway. This arrangement is chronotopic, the deeper axons developing earlier during axogenesis than the more superficial ones (<a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">Reese 1993</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0800">The lateral geniculate nucleus contains cells arranged in six laminae (see <a href="../B9780702077050000306/B9780702077050000306.xhtml#f0030"><span class="bold">Fig. 30.6</span></a>).

Plotting visual field loss frequently reveals the approximate location of the causative lesion and sometimes its nature. Since retinal lesions can be visualized with an ophthalmoscope, field testing might appear to be redundant for such defects, but is still helpful in assessing the extent of the damage and may be the key factor in confirming a diagnosis. For example, field defects in glaucoma that are a consequence of damage to the nerve fibre bundles at the optic nerve head, may be detectable ophthalmoscopically, but confirmation of the diagnosis frequently depends on field assessment. Early defects consist of one or more areas of paracentral focal field loss, progressing to arcuate scotomas. The shape of the defect corresponds to the anatomical arrangement of ganglion cell axons.</div><div class="text" id="p0825">As far as the location of lesions central to the retina is concerned, deficits in the vision of one eye are usually attributable to optic nerve lesions. Lesions of the optic chiasma, involving crossing nerve fibres, produce a bilateral field loss, as exemplified by a pituitary adenoma. The tumour expands upwards from the pituitary fossa, usually compressing the inferior midline of the chiasma, and eventually produces bitemporal hemianopia, starting with an early loss in the upper temporal quadrants (bitemporal quadrantanopia).<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="811" id="pagebreak_811"/><a id="pg811"/><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="812" id="pagebreak_812"/></div><div class="text" id="p0830">Since the optic tract contains contralateral nasal and ipsilateral temporal retinal projections, damage to the tract will cause a homonymous contralateral visual field loss. Although complete disruption of the tract results in contralateral hemianopia, the incomplete spatial segregation of axons within the tract, described above, makes the field losses following smaller lesions harder to interpret. However, they do show substantial incongruity (dissimilar defects in the fields of the two eyes) and often specific functional deficits, consistent with the partial segregation of functionally distinct axons from the two half-retinas (<a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Reese 1993</a>). Incongruity is most marked in defects of the optic tract, less obvious in optic radiation defects, and usually absent in cortically induced field defects, thus providing an additional clue in assessing location of the cause.</div><div class="text" id="p0835">Lesions of the optic radiations are usually unilateral, and commonly vascular in origin. Field defects therefore develop abruptly, in contrast to the slow progression of defects associated with tumours, and the resulting hemifield loss follows the general rule that visual field defects central to the chiasma are on the opposite side to the lesion. Little or no incongruity is seen in visual cortical lesions, but they commonly display the phenomenon of macular sparing, the central 5–10° visual field being retained in an otherwise hemianopic
