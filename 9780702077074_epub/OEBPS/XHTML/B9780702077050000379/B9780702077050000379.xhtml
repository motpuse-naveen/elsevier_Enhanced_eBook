The distribution of the oral mucosa is considered in terms of masticatory, lining and specialized mucosa. Because of their importance in normal oral function and their involvement in many clinical situations, the gross morphology of teeth is described together with the timing of their development and eruption. The detailed structure of the teeth and of their supporting tissues is given. The structure and distribution of taste buds, together with the associated neural pathways, is described. The main neurovascular supply of the region is considered mainly in relation to the distribution of the maxillary artery and the maxillary and mandibular nerves. The functions, composition and secretion of saliva are discussed together with the anatomy and microstructure of the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands. Common clinical/surgical conditions are given, such as swellings in the mouth (e.g. ranulas), dental anaesthesia, spread of infection from the teeth and blockage of the submandibular salivary duct.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Key words</h3><div class="keywords">lingual papillae; mouth; oral mucosa; oral musculature; salivary glands; taste bud; teeth; tongue; trigeminal nerve</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The mouth extends from the lips and cheeks externally to the anterior pillars of the fauces internally, where it continues into the oropharynx. The mouth can be subdivided into the vestibule external to the teeth and the oral cavity proper internal to the teeth (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 37.1</span></a>). The palate forms the roof of the mouth and separates the oral and nasal cavities. The floor of the mouth is formed by the mylohyoid muscles and is occupied mainly by the tongue. The lateral walls of the mouth are defined by the cheeks and retromolar regions. Three pairs of major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular and sublingual) and numerous minor salivary glands (labial, buccal, palatal, lingual) open into the mouth. The muscles in the mouth and oral cavity are associated with the lips, cheeks, floor of the mouth and tongue. The muscles of the lips and cheeks are described with the face in <a href="../B9780702077050000367/B9780702077050000367.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>.

Ectopic sebaceous glands may be evident as yellow patches (Fordyce spots). Their numbers increase in puberty and in later life.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">Few structural landmarks are visible. The parotid duct drains into the cheek opposite the maxillary second molar tooth at a small parotid papilla. A hyperkeratinized line (the linea alba) may be seen at a position related to the occlusal plane of the teeth. In the retromolar region, a fold of mucosa containing the pterygomandibular raphe extends from the upper to the lower alveolus. The entrance to the pterygomandibular space (which contains the lingual and inferior alveolar nerves) lies lateral to this fold and medial to the ridge produced by the anterior border of the ramus of the mandible; this is the site for injection for an inferior alveolar nerve block, commonly used to anaesthetize the ipsilateral lower teeth and gums.</div><section><a id="s0015"/><section><a id="s0020"/><h3 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0025">Vascular supply and innervation</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0030">The cheek receives its arterial blood supply principally from the buccal branch of the maxillary artery, and is innervated by cutaneous branches of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve, via the zygomaticofacial and infraorbital nerves, and by the buccal branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0030">Lips</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0035">The external features of the lips are described in <a href="../B9780702077050000367/B9780702077050000367.xhtml">Chapter 36</a>.

With normal (competent) lips, the tips of the maxillary incisors lie below the upper border of the lower lip, and this arrangement helps to maintain the ‘normal’ inclination of <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="637" id="pagebreak_637"/><a id="pg637"/>the incisors. When the lips are incompetent, the maxillary incisors may not be so controlled and the lower lip may even lie behind them, thus producing an exaggerated proclination of these teeth. A tight, or overactive, lip musculature may be associated with retroclined maxillary incisors. The lips are kept moist both by tongue deposition of saliva and by numerous minor salivary glands within them. These glands are liable to trauma by the teeth, particularly in the lower lip; this can produce a mucocele as a result of either extravasation of saliva into the submucosal tissues or retention of saliva within the gland or its duct.</div><section><a id="s0030"/><section><a id="s0035"/><h3 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0035">Vascular supply and innervation</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0045">The lips are mainly supplied by the superior and inferior labial branches of the facial artery.

When the teeth occlude, the vestibule is a closed space that only communicates with the oral cavity proper in the retromolar regions behind the last molar tooth on each side. Where the mucosa that covers the alveolus of the jaw is reflected on to the lips and cheeks, a trough or sulcus is formed, which is called the fornix vestibuli. A variable number of sickle-shaped folds containing loose connective tissue run across the fornix vestibuli. In the midline, these are the upper and lower labial frenula. Other folds may traverse the fornix near the canines or premolars. The folds in the lower fornix are said to be more pronounced than those in the upper fornix (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 37.2</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000379/main.assets/f37-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 37.2</span> An anterior view of the dentition in centric occlusion, with the lips retracted.

Note the frena (arrows).</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0055">The upper labial frenulum is normally attached well below the alveolar crest. A large frenulum with an attachment near or on the crest may be associated with a midline gap (diastema) between the maxillary first incisors. This can be corrected by simple surgical removal of the frenulum (frenulectomy) because it contains no structures of clinical importance. Prominent frenula may compromise the stability of dentures.</div></section><section><a id="s0045"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0045">Oral Mucosa</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0060">The oral mucosa is continuous with the skin at the labial margins (vermilion border) and with the pharyngeal mucosa at the oropharyngeal isthmus. It varies in structure, function and appearance in different regions of the oral cavity and is traditionally divided into lining, masticatory and specialized mucosae (<a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Presland and Dale 2000</a>).</div><section><a id="s0050"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0050">Lining mucosa</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0065">The lining mucosa is red in colour, and covers the soft palate, ventral surface of the tongue, floor of the mouth, alveolar processes excluding the gingivae, and the internal surfaces of the lips and cheeks. It has a non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, which overlies a loosely fibrous lamina propria, and the submucosa contains some fat deposits and collections of minor mucous salivary glands. The oral mucosa covering the alveolar bone – which supports the roots of the teeth – and the necks (cervical region) of the teeth is divided into two main components. That portion lining the lower part of the alveolus is loosely attached to the periosteum via a diffuse submucosa and is termed the alveolar mucosa. It is delineated from the masticatory gingival mucosa, which covers the upper part of the alveolar bone and the necks of the teeth, by a well-defined junction, the mucogingival junction. The alveolar mucosa appears dark red; the gingival appears pale pink (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 37.2</a>). These colour differences relate to differences in the type of keratinization and the proximity to the surface of underlying small blood vessels, which may sometimes be seen coursing beneath the alveolar mucosa.</div></section><section><a id="s0055"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0055">Masticatory mucosa and the gingivae</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0070">Masticatory mucosa (mucosa that is subjected to masticatory stress) is bound firmly to underlying bone or to the necks of the teeth, and forms a mucoperiosteum in the gingivae and palatine raphe. Gingival, palatal and dorsal lingual mucosae are keratinized or parakeratinized (<a href="#bib42" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_42">Schroeder and Listgarten 1997</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0075">The gingivae may be further subdivided into the attached gingivae and the free gingivae. Attached gingivae are firmly bound to the periosteum of the alveolus and to the teeth, whereas free gingivae, which constitute approximately a 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm margin of the gingivae, lie unattached around the cervical region of each tooth. The free gingival groove between the free and attached gingivae corresponds roughly to the floor of the gingival sulcus that separates the inner surface of the attached gingivae from the enamel. The interdental papilla is that part of the gingivae that fills the space between adjacent teeth. The surface of the attached gingivae is characteristically stippled, although there is considerable inter-individual variation in the degree of stippling, and variation according to age, sex and the health of the gingivae. The free gingivae are not stippled. A mucogingival line delineates the attached gingivae on the buccal surface of the upper and lower jaws (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 37.2</a>) and the lingual surface of the lower jaw from the alveolar mucosa. There is no corresponding obvious division between the attached gingivae and the remainder of the palatal mucosa because this whole surface is orthokeratinized masticatory mucosa, which is pink.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">A submucosa is absent from the gingivae and the midline palatine raphe, but is present over the rest of the hard palate. Posterolaterally, it is thick where it contains mucous salivary glands and the greater palatine nerves and vessels, and it is anchored to the periosteum of the maxillae and palatine bones by collagenous septa.</div><section><a id="s0060"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0060">Vascular supply and lymphatic drainage</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0085">The gingival tissues derive their blood supply from the maxillary and lingual arteries. The buccal gingivae around the maxillary cheek teeth are supplied by gingival and perforating branches from the posterior superior alveolar artery and by the buccal branch of the maxillary artery. The labial gingivae of anterior teeth are supplied by labial branches of the infraorbital artery and by perforating branches of the anterior superior alveolar artery. The palatal gingivae are supplied primarily by branches of the greater palatine artery.</div><div class="text" id="p0090">The buccal gingivae associated with the mandibular cheek teeth are supplied by the buccal branch of the maxillary artery and by perforating branches from the inferior alveolar artery. The labial gingivae around the anterior teeth are supplied by the mental artery and by perforating branches of the incisive artery. The lingual gingivae are supplied by perforating branches from the inferior alveolar artery and by its lingual branch, and by the main lingual artery, a branch of the external carotid artery.</div><div class="text" id="p0095">No accurate description is available concerning the venous drainage of the gingivae, although it may be assumed that buccal, lingual, greater palatine and nasopalatine veins are involved. These veins run into the pterygoid plexuses (apart from the lingual veins, which may pass directly into the internal jugular veins).</div><div class="text" id="p0100">The lymph vessels of the labial and buccal gingivae of the maxillary and mandibular teeth unite to drain into the submandibular nodes, though in the labial region of the mandibular incisors they may drain into the submental lymph nodes. The lingual and palatal gingivae drain into the jugulodigastric group of nodes, either directly or indirectly through the submandibular nodes.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="638" id="pagebreak_638"/><a id="pg638"/></div></section><section><a id="s0065"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0065">Innervation</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0105">The nerves supplying the gingivae in the upper jaw come from the maxillary nerve via its greater palatine, nasopalatine, anterior, middle and posterior superior alveolar branches (see <a href="#t0015">Table 37.2</a>). Surgical division of the nasopalatine nerve, e.g. during the removal of an ectopic canine tooth, causes no obvious sensory deficit in the anterior part of the palate, which suggests that the territory of the greater palatine nerve reaches as far forwards as the gingivae lingual to the incisor teeth or that the nerve has large regenerative potential. The mandibular nerve innervates the gingivae in the lower jaw by its inferior alveolar, lingual and buccal branches.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0070"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0070">Oropharyngeal Isthmus</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0110">The oropharyngeal isthmus lies between the soft palate and the dorsum of the tongue, and is bounded on both sides by the palatoglossal arches.

The fascia of the floor of the mouth lies immediately beneath the oral mucosa and is attached around the inner arc of the mandible, fusing centrally with the connective tissue on the ventral surface of the tongue (<a href="#bib30" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_30">Mills et al 2019</a>). The sublingual glands and submandibular ducts are enveloped by the fascial layer, fibres of the anterior part of genioglossus are suspended beneath it, and branches of the lingual nerve, located superficially on the ventral surface of the tongue, lie immediately deep to the fascia. Normal movements of the anterior part of the tongue create tension in the central region of the fascia and elevate it into a midline fold, the lingual frenulum (<a href="#f0175"><span class="bold">Figs 37.4C,D</span></a>). Restricted movements of the tongue are commonly attributed to the lingual frenulum tethering the tongue, a condition called ankyloglossia (known colloquially as a ‘tongue tie’). Historically, the tongue-tied frenulum has been divided to aid speech but the evidence for this procedure is scanty: there is some evidence that frenotomy may aid breast feeding (<a href="#bib32" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_32">NICE 2005</a>, <a href="#bib50" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_50">Webb et al 2013</a>).</div><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0180"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000379/main.assets/on37-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0190"/><a id="fspara0190"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 37.4</span> The floor of the mouth. <span class="bold">A</span>, View from above when the bulk of the tongue musculature has been removed.

The hard palate is bounded in front and at the sides by the tooth-bearing alveolus of the upper jaw and is continuous posteriorly with the soft palate. It is covered by a thick mucosa bound tightly to the underlying periosteum. In its more lateral regions, it also possesses a submucosa containing the main neurovascular bundle. The mucosa is covered by keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, which shows regional variations and may be ortho- or parakeratinized.</div><div class="text" id="p0200">The periphery of the hard palate consists of gingivae. A narrow ridge, the palatine raphe, devoid of submucosa, runs anteroposteriorly in the midline. An oval prominence, the incisive papilla, lies at the anterior extremity of the raphe. It covers the incisive fossa at the oral opening of the incisive canal and also marks the position of the fetal nasopalatine canal. Irregular transverse ridges or rugae, each containing a core of dense connective tissue, radiate outwards from the palatine raphe in the anterior half of the hard palate; their pattern is unique to the individual.</div><div class="text" id="p0205">The submucosa in the posterior half of the hard palate contains minor mucous-type salivary glands. They secrete via numerous small ducts, which often drain into a larger duct that opens bilaterally at the paired palatine foveae. These depressions, sometimes a few millimetres deep, flank the midline raphe at the posterior border of the hard palate. They provide a useful landmark for the extent of an upper denture; they cause an overextended denture to become unstable when the soft palate moves during deglutition and mastication. The upper surface of the hard palate is the floor of the nasal cavity and is covered by ciliated respiratory epithelium.</div><section><a id="s0170"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0140">Vascular supply and lymphatic drainage</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0210">The palate derives its blood supply principally from the greater palatine artery, a branch of the third part of the maxillary artery. The greater palatine artery descends with its accompanying nerve in the palatine canal, where it gives off two or three lesser palatine arteries, which are transmitted through the lesser palatine canals and foramina to supply the soft palate and tonsil, and anastomose with the ascending palatine branch of the facial artery. The greater palatine artery emerges on to the oral surface of the palate at the greater palatine foramen adjacent to the second maxillary molar and runs in a curved groove near the alveolar border of the hard palate to the incisive canal. It ascends this canal and anastomoses with septal branches of the nasopalatine artery to supply the gingivae, palatine glands and mucous membrane.</div><div class="text" id="p0215">The veins of the hard palate accompany the arteries and drain largely to the pterygoid plexus.</div></section><section><a id="s0175"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0145">Innervation</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0220">The sensory nerves of the hard palate are the greater palatine and nasopalatine branches of the maxillary nerve, which all pass through the pterygopalatine ganglion.

It also communicates with the terminal filaments of the nasopalatine nerve. As it leaves the greater palatine canal, it supplies palatine branches to both surfaces of the soft palate. The lesser (middle and posterior) palatine nerves, which are much smaller, descend through the greater palatine canal and emerge through the lesser palatine foramina in the tubercle of the palatine bone to supply the uvula, tonsil and soft palate. The nasopalatine nerves enter the palate at the incisive foramen and are branches of the maxillary nerve that pass through the pterygopalatine ganglion to supply the anterior part of the hard palate behind the incisor teeth.</div><div class="text" id="p0225">Fibres conveying taste impulses from the palate probably pass via the palatine nerves to the pterygopalatine ganglion, and travel through it without synapsing to join the nerve of the pterygoid canal and the greater petrosal nerve to the facial ganglion, where their cell bodies are situated. The central processes of these neurones traverse the sensory root of the facial nerve (nervus intermedius) to pass to the gustatory nucleus in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius. Parasympathetic postganglionic secretomotor fibres from the pterygopalatine ganglion run with the nerves to supply the palatine mucous glands.</div></section><section><a id="s0180"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0150">Tori</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0235">Tori are benign, localized overgrowths of bone found in both the upper (torus palatinus) and lower (torus mandibularis) jaws. Torus palatinus is more common in females, while torus mandibularis is slightly more common in males. Incidence varies from about 0.5% to over 65%: tori are less frequent in Caucasians and more frequent in Eskimos, Mongoloids and other Asian groups. Aetiology is unclear, but torus palatinus may have a hereditary basis (autosomal dominant) (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">García-García et al 2010</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0240">In the upper jaw, the enlargement is typically seen in the midline.

Tori vary considerably in size, and tend to increase in size with age. They may be related to functional adaptations: there is some evidence that their incidence is decreased when fewer teeth are present in the jaws.

It is partly oral and partly pharyngeal in position, and is attached by its muscles to the hyoid bone, mandible, styloid processes, soft palate and the pharyngeal wall. It has a root, an apex, a curved dorsum and an inferior surface. Its mucosa is normally pink and moist, and is attached closely to the underlying muscles. The dorsal mucosa is covered by numerous papillae, some of which bear taste buds. Intrinsic muscle fibres are arranged in a complex interlacing pattern of longitudinal, transverse, vertical and horizontal fasciculi, and this allows great mobility. Fasciculi are separated by a variable amount of adipose tissue, which increases posteriorly. The root of the tongue is attached to the hyoid bone and mandible, and between them it is in contact inferiorly with geniohyoid and mylohyoid. The dorsum (posterosuperior surface) is generally convex in all directions at rest. It is divided by a V-shaped sulcus terminalis into an anterior, oral (presulcal) part that faces upwards, and a posterior, pharyngeal (postsulcal) part that faces posteriorly. The anterior part forms about two-thirds of the length of the tongue. The two limbs of the sulcus terminalis run anterolaterally to the palatoglossal arches from a median depression, the foramen caecum, which marks the site of the upper end of the embryonic thyroid diverticulum (thyroglossal duct).</div><div class="text" id="p0260">The oral (presulcal) and pharyngeal parts of the tongue differ in their mucosa, innervation and developmental origins.</div><section><a id="s0195"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0165">Oral (presulcal) part</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0265">The oral (presulcal) part of the tongue is located in the floor of the oral cavity. It has an apex touching the incisor teeth, a margin in contact with the gums and teeth, and a superior surface (dorsum) related to the hard and soft palates. On each side, in front of the palatoglossal arch, there are four or five vertical folds, the foliate papillae, which represent vestiges of larger papillae found in many other mammals. The mucosa on the inferior (ventral) surface is smooth, purplish and reflected on to the oral floor and gums; it is connected to the oral floor anteriorly by the lingual frenulum. The deep lingual vein, which is visible, lies lateral to the frenulum on either side. The plica fimbriata (fimbriated fold), a fringed mucosal ridge directed anteromedially towards the apex of the tongue, lies lateral to the vein (see <a href="#f0180">Fig. 37.4B</a>). This part of the tongue develops from the lingual swellings of the mandibular arch and from the tuberculum impar, and this embryological derivation explains its sensory innervation.</div><div class="text" id="p0270">The dorsal mucosa has a longitudinal median sulcus and is covered by filiform, fungiform and circumvallate papillae (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 37.5</span></a>). It is somewhat thicker than the ventral and lateral mucosae, is directly adherent to underlying muscular tissue with no discernible submucosa, and is covered by numerous papillae. The dorsal epithelium consists of a superficial stratified squamous epithelium, which varies from non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium posteriorly, to fully keratinized epithelium overlying the filiform papillae more anteriorly. These features probably reflect the fact that the apex of the tongue is subject to greater dehydration than the posterior and ventral parts and is subject to more abrasion during mastication. The underlying lamina propria is a dense fibrous connective tissue, with numerous elastic fibres, and is continuous with similar tissue extending between the fasciculi of the lingual muscles. It contains numerous vessels and nerves from which the papillae are supplied, and also large lymph plexuses and lingual glands.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0025"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000379/main.assets/f37-05-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0025"/><a id="fspara0025"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 37.5</span> The dorsum of the tongue, adjoining palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches, and epiglottis.

Dorsal lingual veins drain the dorsum and sides of the tongue, join the lingual veins accompanying the lingual artery between hyoglossus and genioglossus, and empty into the internal jugular vein near the greater cornu of the hyoid bone. The deep lingual vein begins near the tip of the tongue and runs back just beneath the mucous membrane on the inferior surface of the tongue. It joins a sublingual vein from the sublingual salivary gland near the anterior border of hyoglossus and forms the vena comitans nervi hypoglossi, which runs back with the hypoglossal nerve between mylohyoid and hyoglossus to join the facial, internal jugular or lingual vein.

Each group is arranged around a central deep crypt, or invagination, which opens on to the surface epithelium. The ducts of mucous glands open into the bases of the crypts. Small isolated follicles also occur beneath the lingual mucosa. The lymphatic drainage of the tongue can be divided into three main regions: marginal, central and dorsal. The anterior region of the tongue drains into marginal and central vessels, and the posterior part of the tongue behind the circumvallate papillae drains into the dorsal lymph vessels. The more central regions may drain bilaterally, and this must be borne in mind when planning to remove malignant tumours of the tongue that are approaching the midline.

It then passes below the mandibular attachment of the superior pharyngeal constrictor and pterygomandibular raphe, closely applied to the periosteum of the medial surface of the mandible. Here it lies opposite the distal (posterior) root of the third molar tooth, where it is covered only by the gingival mucoperiosteum. In about 1 in 7 cases, the lingual nerve may be located above the lingual bony plate and is susceptible to damage during surgery in the region. It next passes medial to the mandibular attachment of mylohyoid, which carries it progressively away from the mandible, and separates it from the alveolar bone covering the mesial root of the third molar tooth. The lingual nerve then passes downwards and forwards on the deep surface of mylohyoid (i.e. the surface nearer the mucosa covering the floor of the mouth), crossing the lingual sulcus beneath the mucosa. In this position, it lies on the deep portion of the submandibular gland, which bulges over the top of the posterior border of mylohyoid.

Type III (presynaptic) cells express proteins associated with synapses and form synaptic junctions with nerve terminals (<a href="#bib6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_6">Chaudhari and Roper 2010</a>). Bitter chemicals are detected by a small family of receptors structurally related to rhodopsin: they may detect either one or a few specific bitter chemicals or many bitter chemicals. The tastes of sweet and umami are evoked by a relatively small number of molecules that signal either calorie-rich (sweet) or protein-rich foods (umami) and are sensed by a single type of GPCR, a heterodimer of a common subunit and a unique subunit. The structurally divergent receptors for sugars, bitter chemicals and amino acids all employ a common canonical phosphoinositide-based signalling pathway. In humans, salty taste is generated mainly by sodium ions and is amiloride-insensitive: it appears to be mediated by a nonselective cation pathway that as yet is less well documented than in experimental animals. In newborn infants, oral sucrose has been shown to reduce procedural pain from single events; the mechanism of this nociceptive effect is not yet fully understood (<a href="#bib48" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_48">Stevens et al 2013</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0580">The taste bud complex is an extremely dynamic system in which there is a rapid turnover of receptor cells: the lifespan of receptor cells produced by the division of epithelial stem cells (basal cells) is approximately 10 days. The gustatory nerves are therefore continually sprouting new processes, forming new synapses with young cells, and retracting synaptic connections with dying cells. It has been calculated that at any one time less than one-third of the cells in a single taste bud are fully innervated. An intact nerve supply is necessary for the normal survival and function of taste buds. If the nerve supply is interrupted, the taste buds degenerate and slough off, although they will reappear and can return to normal function following nerve regeneration.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0505"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0425">Autonomic innervation of the tongue</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0585">The parasympathetic secretomotor innervation of the various lingual mucous glands is via the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve, which synapses in the submandibular ganglion; postganglionic branches are distributed to the lingual mucosa either via the lingual nerve or via plexuses around the lingual arteries.</div><div class="text" id="p0590">The postganglionic sympathetic supply to lingual glands and vessels arises from the carotid plexus (fibres derived from neurones in the superior cervical ganglion) and enters the tongue through plexuses around the lingual arteries.

The first deciduous teeth erupt into the mouth at about 6 months after birth and all of the deciduous teeth have erupted by 3 years of age. The first permanent molar erupts around 6 years, and thence the deciduous teeth are exfoliated one by one, to be replaced by their permanent successors. A complete permanent dentition is present when the third molars erupt at around the age of 18–21 years. In the complete deciduous dentition, there are 20 teeth, 5 in each jaw quadrant.

More than 90% of natal and neonatal teeth are prematurely erupted deciduous mandibular incisors, while less than 10% are supernumerary. Several syndromes have been associated with natal teeth, namely: Ellis–van Creveld, Hallermann–Streiff, Jadassohn–Lewandowski and Pierre Robin syndromes. Histological features are failure of root formation, a large vascular pulp, irregular dentine formation and a failure of cementum formation (<a href="#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">Mhaske et al 2013</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0610">There are three basic tooth forms in both dentitions: incisiform, caniniform and molariform. Incisiform teeth (incisors) are cutting teeth and have thin, blade-like crowns. Caniniform teeth (canines) are piercing or tearing teeth and have a single, stout, pointed, cone-shaped crown. Molariform teeth (molars and premolars) are grinding teeth and possess a number of cusps on an otherwise flattened biting surface. Premolars are bicuspid teeth that are restricted to the permanent dentition and replace the deciduous molars.</div><div class="text" id="p0615">The tooth-bearing region of the jaws can be divided into four quadrants: the right and left maxillary and mandibular quadrants. A tooth may thus be identified according to the quadrant in which it is located (e.g. a right maxillary tooth or a left mandibular tooth). In both the deciduous and permanent dentitions, the incisors may be distinguished according to their relationship to the midline. Thus, the incisor nearest the midline is the central (first) incisor and the incisor that is more laterally positioned is termed the lateral (second) incisor. The permanent premolars and the permanent and deciduous molars can also be distinguished according to their mesiodistal relationships. The molar most mesially positioned is designated the first molar, and the one behind it is the second molar. In the permanent dentition, the tooth most distally positioned is the third molar. The mesial premolar is the first premolar, and the premolar behind it is the second premolar.</div><div class="text" id="p0620">The terminology used to indicate tooth surfaces is shown in <a href="#f0070"><span class="bold">Fig. 37.16B</span></a>. The aspect of teeth adjacent to the lips or cheeks is termed labial or buccal, that adjacent to the tongue being lingual (or palatal in the maxilla). Labial and lingual surfaces of an incisor meet medially at a mesial surface and distally at a distal surface, terms that are also used to describe the equivalent surfaces of premolar and molar (postcanine) teeth. On account of the curvature of the dental arch, mesial surfaces of postcanine teeth are directed anteriorly and distal surfaces are directed posteriorly. Thus, the point of contact between the central incisors is the datum point for mesial and <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="647" id="pagebreak_647"/>distal. The biting or occlusal surfaces of postcanine teeth are tuberculated by cusps that are separated by fissures forming a pattern characteristic of each tooth. The biting surface of an incisor is the incisal edge.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0070"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000379/main.assets/f37-14-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0070"/><a id="fspara0070"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 37.16</span> The permanent teeth: occlusal aspect. <span class="bold">A</span>, The upper dental arch. <span class="bold">B</span>, The lower dental arch.

In labial view, the crowns are trapezoid, and the maxillary incisors (particularly the central) are larger than the mandibular. On eruption, the biting or incisal edges initially have three tubercles or mamelons, which are rapidly removed by wear. In mesial or distal view, their labial profiles are convex while their lingual surfaces are concavo-convex (the convexity near the cervical margin is caused by a low ridge or cingulum, which is prominent only on upper incisors). The roots of incisors are single and rounded in maxillary teeth, but flattened mesiodistally in mandibular teeth. The upper lateral incisor may be congenitally absent or may have a reduced form (peg-shaped lateral incisor).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0075"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000379/main.assets/f37-15-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0075"/><a id="fspara0075"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 37.17</span> The permanent upper and lower teeth of the right side: labial and buccal surfaces.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0630">Behind each lateral incisor is a canine tooth with a single cusp (hence the American term cuspid) instead of an incisal edge. The maxillary canine is stouter and more pointed than the mandibular canine, whose cusp tip is inclined lingually. The canine root, which is the longest of any tooth, produces a bulge (canine eminence) on the alveolar bone externally, particularly in the upper jaw. Although canines usually have single roots, those of the lower jaw may sometimes be bifid.</div><div class="text" id="p0635">Distal to the canines are two premolars, each with a buccal and lingual cusp (hence the term bicuspid). The occlusal surfaces of the maxillary premolars are oval (the long axis is buccopalatal) and a mesiodistal fissure separates the two cusps. In buccal view, premolars resemble the canines but are smaller. The maxillary first premolar has two roots (one buccal, one palatal) but may have one root, or very rarely three roots (two buccal and one palatal); this makes the tooth more likely to fracture on removal. The maxillary second premolar usually has one root. The occlusal surfaces of the mandibular premolars are more circular or squarer than those of the upper premolars. The buccal cusp of the mandibular first premolar towers above a diminutive lingual cusp to which it is connected by a ridge separating the mesial and distal occlusal pits. In the mandibular second premolar, a mesiodistal fissure usually separates a buccal from two smaller lingual cusps. Each lower premolar has one root, but very rarely the root of the first is bifid. Rarely, lower second premolars fail to develop.</div><div class="text" id="p0640">Posterior to the premolars are three molars whose size decreases distally. Each has a large rhomboid (upper jaw) or rectangular (lower jaw) occlusal surface with four or five cusps. The maxillary first molar has a cusp at each corner of its occlusal surface, and the mesiopalatal cusp is connected to the distobuccal by an oblique ridge. A smaller cusplet or tubercle (cusplet of Carabelli) usually appears on the mesiopalatal cusp (most commonly in Caucasian groups). The tooth has three widely separated roots: two buccal, of which the mesiobuccal is larger and broader and the distobuccal is rounder and smaller, and one large palatal. Their proximity to the maxillary air sinus is thought to be the reason first molar roots are wide apart and second and third molar roots are converged. The smaller maxillary second molar has a reduced or occasionally absent distopalatal cusp. Its three roots show varying degrees of fusion. The maxillary third molar, the smallest, is very variable in form. It usually has three cusps (the distopalatal being absent) and commonly the three roots are fused.</div><div class="text" id="p0645">The mandibular first molar has three buccal and two lingual cusps on its rectangular occlusal surface, the smallest cusp being distal. The cusps of this tooth are all separated by fissures. It has two widely separated roots: one mesial and one distal. The smaller mandibular second molar is like the first, but has only four cusps (it lacks the distal cusp of the first molar) and its two roots are closer together. The mandibular third molar is smaller still and, like the upper third molar, is variable in form. Its crown may resemble that of the lower first or second molar and its roots are frequently fused. One or more third molars (upper or lower) often fail to develop.</div><div class="text" id="p0650">The cementum-covered roots of teeth lie in sockets or alveoli, to which they are anchored by the periodontal ligament. The five permanent teeth in each quadrant in front of the molars generally have a single root except for the upper first premolar that has two roots, one buccal and one palatal. The roots are rounded in cross-section and taper towards the apex. The roots of the lower incisors are flattened <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="648" id="pagebreak_648"/><a id="pg648"/>mesiodistally. The upper permanent molars have three roots (two buccal and one palatal) while the lower molars have two roots, one mesial and one distal. The roots of the molar teeth tend to shorten and fuse as one passes from the first to the third molars. When a tooth first erupts, only about two-thirds of the root has formed and it takes a further three years for the root to complete its formation.</div><div class="text" id="p0655">The unmineralized central core of the root contains the vital dental pulp, where it is known as the root canal. Generally, there is one canal present in each root. Exceptions to this are the mesiobuccal root of upper molars, which normally has two canals and the mesial root of lower molars which also usually has two canals.</div><div class="text" id="p0660">If the pulp becomes infected following dental caries, one form of treatment may require the pulp to be removed and replaced by an inert material (root canal therapy). Clearly, it is important to know the number of root canals present in the tooth so that each is filled during the procedure. Three-dimensional radiographs are now available to aid assessment. Should an abscess develop at the apex of a tooth, the important structures related to each tooth must be considered if extraction becomes necessary to avoid iatrogenic complications. Among the most important of these are the maxillary sinus for the upper premolars and molars, the mental nerve for lower premolars and the lingual and inferior alveolar nerves for the lower third molars. The same structures must be avoided when placing dental implants.</div><section><a id="s0525"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0445">Deciduous teeth</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0665">The incisors, canine and premolars of the permanent dentition replace two deciduous incisors, a deciduous canine and two deciduous molars in each jaw quadrant (<a href="#f0080"><span class="bold">Figs 37.18</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0085"><span class="bold">37.19</span></a>). The deciduous incisors and canine are shaped like their successors but are smaller and whiter and become extremely worn in older children. The deciduous second molars resemble the first permanent molars rather than their successors, the premolars. The upper first deciduous molar has a triangular occlusal surface (its rounded ‘apex’ is palatal), and a fissure separates a double buccal cusp from the palatal cusp. The lower first deciduous molar is long and narrow; its two buccal cusps are separated from its two lingual cusps by a zigzagging mesiodistal fissure. Both deciduous molars have large buccal protuberances on their mesial aspect. Upper deciduous molars have three roots (fusion of the palatal and distobuccal root is commonplace), and lower deciduous molars have two roots. These roots diverge more than those of permanent teeth because each developing premolar tooth crown is accommodated directly under the crown of its deciduous predecessor. The roots of deciduous teeth are progressively resorbed by osteoclast-like cells (odontoclasts) prior to being shed.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0080"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000379/main.assets/f37-16-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0080"/><a id="fspara0080"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 37.18</span> The deciduous upper and lower teeth of the right side; labial and buccal surfaces.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0085"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000379/main.assets/f37-17-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0085"/><a id="fspara0085"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 37.19</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, Upper deciduous dentition: note the channels (arrows) leading to the developing permanent teeth. <span class="bold">B</span>, Lower deciduous dentition. <br/><span class="figcredit">With permission from Berkovitz BKB, Moxham BJ 1994 Color Atlas of the Skull.

When opposing occlusal surfaces meet with maximal ‘intercuspation’ (i.e. maximum contact), the teeth are said to be in centric occlusion. In this position, the lower teeth are normally opposed symmetrically and lingually with respect to the upper. Some important features of centric occlusion in a normal (idealized) dentition may be noted. Each lower postcanine tooth is slightly in front of its upper equivalent and the lower canine occludes in front of the upper. Buccal cusps of the lower postcanine teeth lie between the buccal and palatal cusps of the upper teeth. Thus, the lower postcanine teeth are slightly lingual and mesial to their upper equivalents. Lower incisors bite against the palatal surfaces of upper incisors, the latter normally obscuring about one-third of the crowns of the lower. This vertical overlap of incisors in centric occlusion is the overbite. The extent to which upper incisors are anterior to lowers is termed the overjet. In the most habitual jaw position, the resting posture, the teeth are slightly apart, the gap between them being the freeway space or interocclusal clearance. During mastication, especially with lateral jaw movements, the food is comminuted, which facilitates the early stages of digestion.</div><div class="text" id="p0685">The ideal occlusion is a rather subjective concept. If there is an ideal occlusion, it can only presently be defined in broad functional terms. Therefore, the occlusion can be considered ‘ideal’ when the teeth are aligned such that the masticatory loads are within physiological range and act through the long axes of as many teeth in the arch as possible; mastication involves alternating bilateral jaw movements (and not habitual, unilateral biting preferences as a result of adaptation to occlusal interference); lateral jaw movements occur without undue mechanical interference; in the rest position of the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="649" id="pagebreak_649"/><a id="pg649"/>jaw, the gap between teeth (the freeway space) is correct for the individual concerned; and the tooth alignment is aesthetically pleasing to its possessor.</div><div class="text" id="p0690">Variations from the ideal occlusion may be termed malocclusions (although these could be regarded as normal, since they are more commonly found in the population: the majority of the population in the USA has some degree of occlusal ‘disharmony’).

The organic matrix comprises mainly unique enamel proteins, amelogenins and non-amelogenins such as enamelins and tuftelins. Although comprising a very small percentage of the weight and volume of enamel, the organic matrix permeates the whole of enamel.

They reflect a disturbance in mineralization during the first few days after birth. Other accentuated lines can be observed throughout enamel growth; these are generally reflections in disturbances in ameloblast secretion caused by illness or nutritional deficiencies.

It is a tough and compliant composite material, with a mineral content of 70% dry weight (largely crystalline hydroxyapatite with some calcium carbonate) and 20% organic matrix (type I collagen, glycosaminoglycans and phosphoproteins). Its conspicuous feature is the regular pattern of microscopic dentinal tubules, 3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm in diameter, which extend from the pulpal surface to the enamel–dentine junction. The tubules show lateral and terminal branching near the enamel–dentine junction (<a href="#f0115"><span class="bold">Fig. 37.29A</span></a>) and may project a short distance into the enamel (enamel spindles). Each tubule encloses a single cytoplasmic process of an odontoblast whose cell body lies in a pseudostratified layer that lines the pulpal surface. Processes are believed to extend the full thickness of dentine in newly erupted teeth, but in older teeth they may be partly withdrawn and occupy only the pulpal third, while the outer regions contain probably only extracellular fluid. The diameter of the dentine tubule is narrowed by deposition of peritubular dentine. This is different from normal dentine (intertubular dentine) because it is more highly mineralized and lacks a collagenous matrix. Peritubular dentine can therefore be identified by microradiography (<a href="#f0115"><span class="bold">Fig. 37.29B</span></a>). In time, it may completely fill the tubule, a process that gives rise to translucent dentine and that commences in the apical region of the root.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0115"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000379/main.assets/f37-23-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0115"/><a id="fspara0115"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 37.29</span> Dentine. <span class="bold">A</span>, Ground longitudinal section showing branching of dentine tubules near the enamel–dentine junction (arrow). <span class="bold">B</span>, Microradiograph of transversely sectioned dentinal tubules surrounded by a more radiopaque and therefore more mineralized zone of peritubular dentine. <span class="bold">C</span>, Ground longitudinal section showing alternate light and dark bands representing long-period incremental lines (Andresen lines; viewed in polarized light).

In the crown, it is referred to as mantle dentine and differs in the orientation of its collagen fibres. In the root, the peripheral zone presents a granular layer – with less overall mineral – beyond which is a hyaline layer that lacks a tubular structure and may function to produce a good bond between the cementum and dentine.</div><div class="text" id="p0825">Dentine is formed slowly throughout life, and so there is always an unmineralized zone of predentine at the surface of the mineralized dentine, adjacent to the odontoblast layer at the periphery of the pulp. Biochemical changes within the mineralizing matrix mean that predentine stains differently to the matrix of the mineralized dentine. The predentine–dentine border is generally scalloped, because dentine mineralizes both linearly and as microscopic spherical aggregates of crystals (calcospherites). Dentine, like enamel, is deposited incrementally, and exhibits both short- and long-term incremental lines (<a href="#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_8">Dean 2000</a>). Long-term lines are known as Andresen lines and in the mid-axial region are approximately 20<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm apart; they represent increments of about 6–12 days (<a href="#f0115"><span class="bold">Fig. 37.29C</span></a>).

Where mineralization spans birth (i.e. all deciduous teeth and usually the first permanent molars), a neonatal line is formed in dentine similar to that which is seen in enamel, and it signals the abrupt change in both environment and nutrition that occurs at birth. As with enamel, disturbances in growth of dentine will exhibit as accentuated lines, commonly called contour lines of Owen.</div><div class="text" id="p0830">Primary dentine formation proceeds at a steady but declining rate as first the crown and then the root is completed. A slow and intermittent deposition of dentine (regular secondary dentine) continues throughout life and further reduces the size of the pulp chamber; it is distinguished from primary dentine by the reduction and less regular arrangement of dentinal tubules within it. The presence of the odontoblast process means that dentine is a vital tissue. It responds to adverse external stimuli – such as rapidly advancing caries, excessive wear or tooth breakage – by forming poorly mineralized dead tracts, in which the odontoblasts of the affected region die and the tubules remain empty (tertiary dentine). A dead tract may be sealed from the pulp by a thin zone of sclerosed dentine and the deposition of irregular (tertiary) dentine by newly differentiated pulp cells (<a href="#f0120"><span class="bold">Fig. 37.30</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0120"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000379/main.assets/f37-24-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0120"/><a id="fspara0120"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 37.30</span> Longitudinal ground section of an incisor tooth.</figcaption></figure></div></section><section><a id="s0650"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0540">Dental pulp</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0835">Dental pulp provides the nutritive support for the synthetic activity of the odontoblast layer. It is a well-vascularized, soft, loose connective tissue, enclosed by dentine and continuous with the periodontal ligament via apical and accessory foramina. Several thin-walled arterioles enter by the apical foramen and run longitudinally within the pulp to an extensive subodontoblastic plexus. Blood flow rate per unit volume of tissue is greater in the pulp than in other oral tissues, and tissue fluid pressures within the pulp appear to be unusually high.</div><div class="text" id="p0840">As well as typical connective tissue cells, pulp uniquely contains the cell bodies of odontoblasts whose long processes occupy the dentinal tubules. Pulp also has dendritic antigen-presenting cells. Approximately 60% of pulpal collagen is type I, and the bulk of the remainder is type III. As dentine deposition increases with age, the pulp recedes until the whole of the crown may be removed without accessing the pulp.</div><div class="text" id="p0845">Dental pulp is extensively innervated by postganglionic vasoconstrictor sympathetic nerve fibres from the superior cervical ganglion, which enter with the arterioles, and by myelinated (Aδ) and unmyelinated (C) sensory nerve fibres from the trigeminal ganglion, which traverse the pulp longitudinally and ramify as a plexus (Raschkow’s plexus) beneath the odontoblast layer (<a href="#f0125"><span class="bold">Figs 37.31</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0130"><span class="bold">37.32</span></a>). Here, any myelinated nerve fibres lose their myelin sheaths and continue into the odontoblast layer, and some enter the dentinal tubules, especially the region beneath the cusps. Stimulation of dentine, whether by thermal, mechanical or osmotic means, evokes a pain response. Pulp nerves release numerous neuropeptides such as CGRP, substance P and neuropeptide Y that maintain homeostasis within the pulp.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="651" id="pagebreak_651"/><a id="pg651"/></div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0125"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000379/main.assets/f37-25-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0125"/><a id="fspara0125"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 37.31</span> Longitudinal section of a tooth and its surrounding tissues.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0130"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000379/main.assets/f37-26-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0130"/><a id="fspara0130"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 37.32</span> Longitudinal demineralized section of a tooth stained with a silver impregnation technique.

However, unlike bone, cementum is avascular and lacks nerves. The cementum generally overlaps the enamel slightly, although it may meet it end on. Occasionally, the two tissues may fail to meet, in which case dentine is exposed in the mouth. If the exposed dentinal tubules remain patent, then the teeth may be sensitive to stimuli such as cold water. In older teeth, the root may become exposed in the mouth as a consequence of occlusal drift and gingival recession, and cementum is often abraded away by incorrect tooth brushing and dentine is exposed.</div><div class="text" id="p0855">Like bone, cementum is perforated by Sharpey’s fibres, which represent the attachment bundles of collagen fibres in the periodontal ligament (extrinsic fibres). New layers of cementum, which are deposited incrementally throughout life to compensate for tooth movements, incorporate new Sharpey’s fibres. Incremental lines are irregularly spaced. The first (primary) cementum to be formed is thin (up to 200<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm) and acellular, and contains only extrinsic fibres. Cementum formed later (secondary cementum) towards the root apex is produced more rapidly and contains cells, the cementocytes, lying in lacunae joined by canaliculi. The latter are mainly directed towards their source of nutrients from the periodontal ligament. This cementum contains mainly intrinsic collagen fibres of cementoblastic origin, which lie parallel to the surface. Varying arrangements of layering between cellular and acellular cement occur. With increasing age, cellular cement may reach a thickness of a millimetre or more around the apices and at the branching of the roots, where it compensates for the loss of enamel by attrition. Cementum is not remodelled but small areas of resorption with evidence of repair may be seen.</div></section><section><a id="s0660"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0550">Periodontal ligament</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0860">The principal functions of the periodontal ligament are to support the teeth, generate the force of tooth eruption and provide sensory information about tooth position and forces to facilitate reflex jaw activity during chewing movements.

It also contains a network of epithelial cells (epithelial cell rests of Malassez, ERM cells), which are embryological remnants of an epithelial root sheath. Although their function remains speculative, ERM cells have been implicated in root development and protection against root resorption, and in reparative/regenerative functions of the pulp and periodontal tissues such as apexogenesis and periodontal healing (<a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_22">Keinan and Cohen 2013</a>).

Like bone in other sites, alveolar bone functions as a mineralized supporting tissue, gives attachment to muscles, provides a framework for bone marrow and acts as a reservoir for ions, especially calcium. It is dependent on the presence of teeth for its development and maintenance, and requires functional stimuli to maintain bone mass.

Superimposition also obscures the Volkmann’s canals. Chronic infections of the dental pulp spread into the periodontal ligament, which leads to resorption of the lamina dura around the root apex (see <a href="#f0150">Fig. 37.36</a>).

Only rarely is it plexiform. The nerve may lie on the lingual or buccal side of the mandible (slightly more commonly on the buccal side). Even when the third molar tooth is in a normal position, the nerve may be so intimately related to it that it grooves its root. Exceptionally, the nerve may be similarly related to the second molar.</div><div class="text" id="p0975">The failure of complete anaesthesia to the mandibular teeth following an inferior alveolar nerve block, which is meant to anaesthetize the nerve before its entrance into the mandibular canal, indicates that there are alternative pathways for sensory nerves to the teeth. Knowledge of these alternative pathways is important in helping clinicians to obtain complete dental anaesthesia. These alternative pathways involve anatomical variation in the distribution of the inferior alveolar nerve, the buccal branch of the mandibular nerve, the mylohyoid nerve, the lingual nerve, the deep temporal nerves and the cervical plexus. The inferior alveolar nerve may give multiple branches before entering the mandibular canal, one or more of which may escape anaesthesia following inferior alveolar nerve block. They may then re-enter the mandible via small accessory foramina in the retromolar region to supply sensation to the molar teeth (<a href="#f0215"><span class="bold">Fig. 37.37</span></a>). The buccal branch of the mandibular nerve, which supplies the buccal gingivae of the molar teeth, may also possess a branch that passes through a small retromolar foramen to supply the molar teeth. The mylohyoid nerve is primarily a motor nerve supplying mylohyoid and the anterior belly of the digastric, but it carries sensory fibres that may enter the mandible via one or more small retromental foramina in the vicinity of the genial tubercles to supply some sensation to the anterior teeth. Communications exist between the inferior alveolar and lingual nerves. If the lingual nerve is not anaesthetized during an inferior alveolar nerve block, this pathway could account for any remaining sensation in the teeth. Although the deep temporal nerves are primarily motor, it has been suggested that terminal branches may pass from the substance of temporalis to enter the mandible through foramina in the retromolar region to supply some sensation to molar teeth. In the cervical plexus, the great auricular nerve, formed by the anterior primary rami of the second and third cervical spinal nerves, supplies skin over the angle of the mandible. It is possible that this nerve may provide a branch that penetrates the mandible to supply one or more of the cheek teeth.</div><div id="p0980"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0215"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000379/main.assets/on37-08-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0225"/><a id="fspara0225"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 37.37</span> A bifid inferior alveolar canal in which a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve enters the mandible through an accessory foramen in the retromolar region (arrowed) to supply sensation to the molar teeth. <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Dr Clare Gleeson.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="text" id="p0985">If a successful inferior alveolar nerve block does not completely anaesthetize teeth in a jaw quadrant, additional local injections of anaesthetic solution around the tooth in question may be necessary to block the alternative pathways described above.

In children, there is evidence to suggest that the lingula is variable in position and its position from the occlusion plane increases with age.

As the third mandibular molar teeth (the wisdom teeth) are the last to erupt, they are often impeded in their eruption and either become impacted or remain unerupted deeply within the jaw bone. If the tooth is completely covered by bone and mucosa, it is very unlikely to cause any symptoms, and the subject remains unaware of its presence unless the tooth is seen on a routine dental radiograph. Very rarely, the surrounding dental follicle may undergo cystic degeneration, which can ‘hollow out’ the jaw, usually the mandible, to a considerable degree. The developing cyst may displace the tooth as it expands and the tooth may end up as far away as the condylar neck or coronoid process.</div><div class="text" id="p0995">More commonly, the erupting wisdom tooth erupts partially before impacting against the distal aspect of the second molar. When this occurs, symptoms are common due to recurrent soft tissue inflammation and infection around the partially erupted tooth caused by food impaction. This condition is known as pericoronitis and, if the infecting organism is virulent, the infection may rapidly spread into the adjacent tissue spaces as described elsewhere (see below and <a href="../B9780702077050000380/B9780702077050000380.xhtml">Ch. 38</a>). The tooth only merits surgical removal if the patient suffers a severe bout or multiple bouts of pericoronitis. Surgery is not immediately indicated because it is associated with a degree of morbidity: the lingual and inferior alveolar nerves, which are often in close proximity to the tooth, may be damaged during its removal. The lingual nerve passes across the surface of the periosteum lingually to the lower wisdom tooth, separated from the tooth only by a cortical plate of bone no thicker than an eggshell. Damage to this nerve results in altered sensation (paraesthesia) to the ipsilateral side of the tongue and floor of mouth.</div><div class="text" id="p1000">A major problem when extracting mandibular third molar teeth, especially if they are impacted, is possible damage to the inferior alveolar nerve. Indeed, surgical treatment may only necessitate the removal of the crown, leaving behind the roots (after suitable root filling). Maxillary third molars are only rarely impacted because they erupt posteroinferiorly. A clear radiograph is required before any tooth extraction is undertaken in order to alert the dental surgeon to any problems that may be encountered. For example, although the inferior alveolar nerve and its accompanying vessels generally lie beneath the roots of the third permanent molar in the mandibular canal, the neurovascular bundle may occupy a higher position, close to the roots, and may even run between the roots. This may be evident in routine periapical or orthopantomograph radiographs as a constriction or deviation of the mandibular canal or as a radiolucent canal overlying the roots of the third molar (<a href="#f0220"><span class="bold">Fig. 37.38</span></a>). In this situation, the inferior alveolar nerve is at risk during extraction of third molars; damage to the nerve may result in paraesthesia in the distribution of the mental nerve, with consequent altered sensation or numbness in the lower lip. The root of a mandibular premolar may occasionally be unusually long and may be in close relationship to the mental nerve, which may then be at risk during extraction of this tooth.</div><div id="p1005"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0220"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000379/main.assets/on37-09-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0230"/><a id="fspara0230"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 37.38</span> A radiograph showing that the mandibular canal containing the inferior alveolar canal and its contents (arrow) are closely related to the roots of the impacted permanent mandibular third molar. <br/><span class="figcredit">With permission from Berkovitz BKB, Holland GR, Moxham BJ 2009 Oral Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, 4th ed.

The mechanism underlying this sensitivity is of considerable clinical significance and is controversial. Currently, the most widely accepted view is that fluid movements through the dentine tubules stimulate nerve endings at the periphery of the dental pulp (hydrodynamic hypothesis).</div><section><a id="s0730"/><section><a id="s0735"/><h5 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0615">Local analgesia</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1015">It is technically possible to achieve profound regional anaesthesia by depositing local anaesthetic solution adjacent to the trigeminal nerve trunks or their branches within the infratemporal fossa. These injections can either be performed transorally (posterior superior alveolar nerve block, maxillary nerve block, inferior alveolar nerve block, lingual nerve block and mandibular nerve block) or, rarely, by an external route through the skin of the face (maxillary nerve block, inferior alveolar nerve block and mandibular nerve block).</div><div class="text" id="p1020">In the case of the mandible, the anterior teeth can be anaesthetized by simple diffusion techniques, as the bone is relatively thin. However, this is not adequate for the cheek teeth due to the increased thickness of the bone. In this case, the inferior alveolar nerve has to be anaesthetized before it enters the inferior alveolar canal. The needle has to be placed within the pterygomandibular space to achieve a successful inferior alveolar nerve block. The lingual nerve is also usually blocked, as it lies close to the inferior alveolar nerve. Because of the other structures within the infratemporal fossa, it is important for the operator to have a detailed knowledge of the anatomy in this region in order to understand, and therefore try to avoid, the complications that may arise. Any damage to blood vessels in the infratemporal fossa, including the pterygoid venous plexus, can lead to haematoma formation. In extreme cases, bleeding can track through the inferior orbital fissure, resulting in a retrobulbar haematoma, which can lead to loss of visual acuity or blindness. Intravascular injection of local anaesthetic solution (which usually contains adrenaline (epinephrine)) can have profound systemic effects, and for this reason an aspirating syringe is always used to check that the needle has not entered a vessel prior to injection (vessels in this area that theoretically may be entered include the maxillary and internal carotid arteries). If the needle is placed too medially, it may enter medial pterygoid; if directed too laterally, it may penetrate temporalis. In either case, there will be a lack of anaesthesia, followed later by trismus. If the needle is placed too deeply, anaesthetic solution may cause a temporary facial nerve palsy resulting from conduction block in the facial nerve in the region of the parotid gland. Local anaesthetic solution may enter the orbit via the inferior orbital fissure and give orbital symptoms, the most likely being a temporary paralysis of the abducens nerve with loss of activity of lateral rectus.</div><div class="text" id="p1025">The root apices of the maxillary cheek teeth are close to, and may even invaginate, the maxillary sinus. The permanent tooth most commonly involved is the upper second molar, followed by the first molar; less frequently, premolars and the third molar may be involved. The likelihood of cavitation of the maxillary sinus increases significantly after tooth extraction. During removal of fractured root apices in this region, care must therefore be taken to ensure that the root fragment is not pushed into the sinus. Similarly, during root canal treatment, care must be taken to ensure that any filling material is not pushed into the sinus. When routine radiographs fail to provide sufficient definition of the close relationship between the floor of the maxillary sinus and root apices, CBCT may be necessary to provide additional detail (<a href="#f0225"><span class="bold">Fig. 37.39</span></a>).</div><div id="p1030"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0225"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000379/main.assets/on37-10-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0235"/><a id="fspara0235"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 37.39</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, A routine orthopantomogram showing the roots of the permanent maxillary molar teeth and the maxillary sinus (M): the precise relationship of the root apices to the floor of the maxillary sinus is unclear. <span class="bold">B</span>, Cone beam computed tomography of the same patient shown in <span class="bold">A</span>; the image in the sagittal plane clearly shows the two buccal root apices (arrow) of the permanent maxillary second molar tooth invaginating into the maxillary sinus (M). <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Dr J Davies.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0740"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0620">Salivary Glands</h2><div class="textfl" id="p1045">Salivary glands are compound, tubuloacinar exocrine glands whose ducts open into the oral cavity. They secrete saliva, a fluid that lubricates food to assist deglutition, moistens the buccal mucosa, which is important for speech, and provides an aqueous solvent necessary for taste and a fluid seal for sucking and suckling. Salivary glands also secrete digestive enzymes, e.g. salivary amylase, and antimicrobial agents, e.g. immunoglobulin A (IgA), lysozyme and lactoferrin, into saliva. Most salivary IgA is derived from the blood by passive leakage mainly via gingival crevicular epithelium (<a href="#bib4" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_4">Brandtzaeg 2013</a>).

Serous glands (of von Ebner) occur around the circumvallate papillae; their secretion is watery, and they probably assist in gustation by spreading taste stimuli over the taste buds and then washing them away.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="659" id="pagebreak_659"/><a id="pg659"/></div></section><section><a id="s0805"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0685">Microstructure</h3><div class="textfl" id="p1175">Salivary glands have numerous lobes composed of smaller lobules separated by dense connective tissue that is continuous with the capsule of the gland, and contains excretory (collecting) ducts, blood vessels, lymph vessels, nerve fibres and small ganglia. Each lobule has a single duct, whose branches terminate at dilated secretory ‘end-pieces’, which are tubular or acinar in shape (<a href="#f0160"><span class="bold">Fig. 37.43</span></a>). Their primary secretion is modified as it flows through intercalated, striated and excretory ducts into one or more main ducts that discharge saliva into the oral cavity.

Mucous tubules are often associated with groups of serous cells at their blind ends, appearing as crescent-shaped serous demilunes in routine histological preparations.

Their nuclei vary in shape and position, but are more rounded and situated less basally than in mucous cells. Apically, the cytoplasm is filled by proteinaceous secretory (zymogen) granules with high amylase activity. Additionally, serous cells secrete kallikrein, lactoferrin and lysozyme, an antibacterial enzyme whose synthesis has been localized in particular to the serous demilunes of the submandibular and sublingual glands, and which is important in the defence against oral pathogens. In the human parotid and submandibular glands, zymogen granules also show a positive periodic acid–Schiff staining reaction, which indicates the presence of polysaccharides, and some texts refer to these cells as seromucous. Mucous cells are cylindrical and have flattened, basal nuclei. Their apical cytoplasm is typically packed with large, pale-staining and electron-translucent secretory droplets. The histological appearance of serous and mucous cells will vary according to the stage in the secretory cycle.</div><section><a id="s0810"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0690">Ducts</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1190">Intercalated, striated (both intralobular) and extralobular collecting ducts lead consecutively from the secretory end-pieces. The lining cells of intercalated ducts are flat nearest the secretory end-piece but become cuboidal. Intercalated ducts function primarily as a conduit for saliva but, together with the striated ducts, may also modify its content of electrolytes and secrete IgA. Striated ducts are lined by a low columnar epithelium and are so called because their lining cells have characteristic basal striations. The latter are regions of highly infolded basal plasma membrane, between which lie columns of vertically aligned mitochondria. The nuclei are consequently displaced by the basal striations from a typical ductal basal position to a central or even apical location (see <a href="#f0165">Fig. 37.44</a>). Infolding of the basal plasma membrane and local abundance of mitochondria are typical features of epithelial cells that actively transport electrolytes. Here, the cells transport potassium and bicarbonate into saliva; they produce a hypotonic saliva by reabsorbing sodium and chloride ions in excess of water. Striated ducts modify electrolyte composition and secrete IgA (<a href="../B9780702077050000045/B9780702077050000045.xhtml">Ch. 4</a>), lysozyme and kallikrein. The intralobular ductal system of the sublingual gland is less well developed than that of the parotid and submandibular glands.</div><div class="text" id="p1195">Collecting ducts are metabolically relatively inert conduits that run within interlobular connective tissue septa in the glands. They transport saliva to the main duct, which opens on to the mucosal surface of the buccal cavity. The lining epithelium of collecting ducts varies. It may be pseudostratified columnar, stratified cuboidal or columnar in the larger ducts, and has a distinct basal layer. It becomes a stratified squamous epithelium near the buccal orifice.</div></section><section><a id="s0815"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0695">Myoepithelial cells</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1200">Myoepithelial cells are contractile cells that lie between the basal laminae and the epithelial cells proper and extend numerous cytoplasmic processes around the serous acini and intercalated ducts (<a href="#bib33" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_33">Ogawa 2003</a>).

Myoepithelial cells associated with ducts are more fusiform in shape and are aligned along the length of the duct.</div>


<div class="text" id="p1205">Although stimulated by the autonomic nervous system, the precise functional role of myoepithelial cells in salivary secretion awaits clarification (<a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_14">Garrett 1998</a>, <a href="#bib35" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Proctor 2016</a>). Functional studies clearly indicate that myoepithelial activity can accelerate the initial outflow of saliva, reduce luminal volume, contribute to the secretory pressure, support the underlying parenchyma, reduce back-permeation of fluid and help salivary flow to overcome increases in peripheral resistance (although, if this is excessive, it may lead to sialectatic damage of striated ducts, thereby increasing overall permeability).</div></section><section><a id="s0820"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0700">Basal cells</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1210">A population of basal cells is present in the striated and collecting ducts (<a href="#bib39" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_39">Riva et al 1992</a>). They are sparsely distributed in the striated ducts and more densely distributed in the collecting ducts, in which they form a continuous layer as the ducts pass further towards the hilum. A small population of basal cells is found on the abluminal surface of ductal cells associated with both striated and collecting ducts. These cells can be distinguished from other parenchymal cells by a combination of their morphology, their co-expression of cytokeratin 14 and the anti-apoptotic factor cl-2, and a proliferative index of about 3%, which is the highest of any cell in the region. Basal cells have been implicated as potential stem cells during turnover and/or cell regeneration in salivary glands and during metaplasia, when oncocytes and sebaceous cells may appear. However, some cell division is seen in all parenchymal cell types, including myoepithelial cells, and all these cells may be involved in salivary gland regeneration.

Secretion may be continuous but at a low resting level, and may also occur spontaneously. It is mainly a response to the drying of the oral and pharyngeal mucosae. A rapid increase can be superimposed on the resting level, e.g. during mastication or when stimulated by the autonomic innervation. The controlled variation in the activity of the many types of salivary effector cells (serous, seromucous and mucous secretory cells, myoepithelial cells, epithelial cells of all the ductal elements and the smooth muscle of local blood vessels) affects the quantity and quality of saliva. There is no clear evidence that circulating hormones evoke secretion directly at physiological levels but they may alter the response of glandular cells to neural stimuli.</div><div class="text" id="p1225">The control of salivation depends on reflex nerve impulses. The afferent inputs to the reflex arc pass to brainstem salivatory centres, especially from taste and mechanoreceptors in the mouth. A variety of other sensory modalities in and around the mouth are also involved, e.g. smell, for certain aspects of submandibular secretion in humans. The afferent input is integrated centrally by the salivatory centres, which are themselves influenced by higher centres. The latter may provide facilitatory or inhibitory influences, which presumably explains why the mouth becomes dry under stress. The efferent drive to the glands passes via parasympathetic and sympathetic outputs from the centres. Relatively little is known about the connections of the preganglionic parasympathetic neurones in the salivatory centres, and virtually nothing is known about either the central location of the sympathetic preganglionic neurones, or the output pathways. No peripheral inhibitory mechanisms exist in the glands (<a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Garrett et al 1999</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1230">The typical pattern of innervation is shown in <a href="#f0160">Fig. 37.43</a>, but details vary in different glands and with age. Only the more constant features are illustrated and described here. Cholinergic nerves often accompany ducts and arborize freely around secretory end-pieces, but adrenergic nerves usually enter glands along arteries and ramify with them. The main secretomotor nerves are predominantly unmyelinated axons; the few myelinated axons that have been seen are presumably either preganglionic efferent or visceral afferent. Within the glands, the nerve fibres intermingle, such that cholinergic and adrenergic axons often lie in adjacent invaginations of one Schwann cell. Secretion and vasoconstriction are mediated via separate sympathetic axons. A single parasympathetic axon may, through serial <span class="italic">en passant</span> terminals, induce vasodilation, secretion and myoepithelial contraction.</div><div class="text" id="p1235">Secretory end-pieces are usually the most densely innervated structures in the gland; individual cells often have both cholinergic and adrenergic innervation. Secretion of water and electrolytes, which creates the foundation for the volume of saliva secreted, is the outcome of a complex set of processes that is largely induced by parasympathetic impulses. Secretion of protein is an ongoing constitutive process wherever it occurs. The regulated exocytosis of pre-packaged proteins, which is the principal source of protein secretion into saliva, depends on the relative levels of activity in sympathetic and parasympathetic fibres.</div><div class="text" id="p1240">The ductal elements of salivary glands can markedly modify the composition of saliva. They are less densely innervated than secretory <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="661" id="pagebreak_661"/><a id="pg661"/>end-pieces but their activity is also under neural control. Adrenal aldosterone promotes resorption of sodium and release of potassium into saliva by striated ductal cells, as it does in kidney tubules. Myoepithelial contraction is stimulated mainly by adrenergic innervation but there may be an additional role for cholinergic axons.</div><section><a id="s0835"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0715">Age changes in salivary glands</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1245">A wide range of age changes has been documented in salivary glands. In neonates, acini and ducts are immature and widely separated by abundant vascular connective tissue. After the age of 6 months, glandular structure is more compact and there are numerous lymphocytic foci (<a href="#bib43" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_43">Scott 1979</a>). Over the age of 50 years, the amount of glandular tissue decreases and the amount of fibrous tissue, adipocytes, inflammatory cells and oncocytes increases. An increase in duct volume has also been described, although it may in part reflect shrinkage of acini, giving the appearance of duct-like forms (<a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_44">Scott 1986</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1250">With such a significant loss of parenchyma (in both major and minor glands), it might be assumed that there would be a reduction in the amount of saliva produced in the aged population, giving rise to the clinical condition of xerostomia (dry mouth). However, in healthy, unmedicated individuals, this is not the case. This could be interpreted as the result of salivary glands being able to produce more saliva than is needed but is more likely to be a secondary effect related to the increased use of medication (many drugs depress salivary production and many, such as antidepressants and antihistamines, are anticholinergic). Saliva is important in the maintenance of oral health; decreased secretion from the salivary glands results in an increased incidence in oral conditions such as periodontal disease, dental caries and candidal infections (‘thrush’).</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0840"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0720">Tissue spaces around the jaws</h2><div class="textfl" id="p1255">The dissemination of infection in soft tissues is influenced by the natural barriers presented by bone, muscle and fascia.

The submandibular space is situated between the anterior and posterior bellies of the digastric muscle and communicates with the sublingual space around the posterior free border of mylohyoid. The sublingual space lies in the floor of the mouth, above the mylohyoid muscles, and is continuous across the midline; it communicates with the submandibular spaces over the posterior free borders of the mylohyoid muscles, helped by the submandibular gland’s slight extension over this edge.</div><div class="text" id="p1275">The remaining tissue spaces are illustrated in <a href="#f0170"><span class="bold">Fig. 37.45B</span></a>.

The pterygomandibular space lies between the medial surface of the ramus of the mandible and medial pterygoid, and the parotid space lies behind the ramus of the mandible, in and around the parotid gland. The parapharyngeal space is bounded by the superior constrictor of the pharynx and the medial surface of medial pterygoid. It is restricted to the infratemporal region of the head and the suprahyoid region of the neck, and communicates with the retropharyngeal space, which itself extends into the retrovisceral space in the lower part of the neck (the tissue spaces of the neck are described in <a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355.xhtml">Chapter 35</a> and those of the pharynx in <a href="../B9780702077050000409/B9780702077050000409.xhtml">Chapter 40</a>).

The canine space associated with the canine fossa lies between levator labii superioris and the zygomaticus muscles. The palatal space is not truly a tissue space in the hard palate, since the mucosa there is firmly bound to the periosteum. However, inflammation can strip away some of this periosteum to produce a well-circumscribed abscess. The infratemporal space is the upper extremity of the pterygomandibular space and is closely related to the maxillary tuberosity and therefore the upper molars.</div></section><section><a id="s0855"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0735">Dental abscess</h3><div class="textfl" id="p1285">Abscesses developing in relation to the apices of roots ultimately penetrate the surrounding bone where it is thinnest. The position of the resultant swelling in the soft tissues is largely determined by the relationship between muscle attachments and the sinus (the path taken by the infected material) in the bone. Thus, in the lower incisor region, because the labial bone is thin, abscesses generally appear as a swelling in the labial sulcus, above the attachment of mentalis. The abscess may open below mentalis, when it will point beneath the chin. If an abscess from a lower postcanine tooth opens below the attachment of buccinator, the swelling is in the face; if it opens above, the swelling is in the buccal sulcus of the mouth. If an abscess opens lingually above mylohyoid, the swelling is in the lingual sulcus; if it is below, the swelling is in the neck. Third molar abscesses tend to track into the neck rather than the mouth because mylohyoid ascends posteriorly and the termination of its attachment is variable, sometimes terminating before the position of the third molar and thereby allowing relatively unhindered access into the tissue spaces of the neck.</div><div class="text" id="p1290">Apart from canine teeth, which have long roots, abscesses on upper teeth usually open buccally below, rather than above, the attachment of buccinator. Because its root apex is occasionally curved towards the palate, abscesses of the upper lateral incisors may track into the palatal submucosa. Abscesses of upper canines often open facially just below the orbit. Here, the swelling may obstruct drainage in the angular part of the facial vein, which has no valves, and it is therefore possible for infected material to travel via the angular and ophthalmic veins into the cavernous sinus, potentially causing a cavernous sinus thrombosis. Abscesses on the palatal roots of upper molars usually open on the palate. Upper second premolars and first and second molars are related to the maxillary sinus. When this is large, the root apices of these teeth may be separated from its cavity solely by the lining mucosa. Sinus infections may stimulate the nerves entering the teeth, simulating toothache in the ipsilateral premolars and molars; this phenomenon is known as referred pain. Upper first premolars and third molars may be closely related to the maxillary sinus.</div><div class="text" id="p1295">With loss of teeth, alveolar bone is extensively resorbed. Thus, in the edentulous mandible, the mental nerve, originally inferior to premolar roots, may lie near the crest of the bone. In the edentulous maxilla, the sinus may enlarge to approach the oral surface of the bone. Both of these facts are of importance when planning surgery in this area.</div><div class="text" id="p1300">Severe systemic infections during the time the teeth are developing may lead to faults in enamel, which are visible as horizontal lines (cf.
