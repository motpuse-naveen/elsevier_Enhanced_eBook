They are comprised primarily of the striatum (caudate and putamen) and globus pallidus. They are closely related to the substantia nigra and subthalamic nuclei. They interconnect with other brainstem nuclei, including the pedunculopontine nucleus, certain thalamic nuclei and the cerebral cortex. Anatomical models of basal ganglia circuitry implicate aberrant inhibitory or excitatory circuitry in so-called extrapyramidal disturbances of bradykinesia such as Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, tremor and dyskinesia such as Huntingdon’s chorea. More recent rate theories of basal ganglia function hypothesize that its components oscillate in neuronal synchrony at different frequencies to select specific voluntary motor patterns. The basal ganglia are also involved in cognition and emotion with parallel segregated components comprising dorsal cognitive and ventral limbic corticostriatal loops. Their dysfunction is thus also implicated in psychiatric disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder. Several basal ganglia structures are rich in neuromodulatory monoamines including dopamine and acetylcholine enabling pharmacotherapy for disorders of movement, cognition and emotion. Elucidation of basal ganglia function by rodent and non-human primate research has enabled clinical application of neurosurgical treatments like stereotactic lesions and deep brain stimulation.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">caudate; deep brain stimulation; dopamine; dyskinesia; globus pallidus; pedunculopontine nucleus; putamen; substantia nigra; subthalamic nucleus; striatum</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The term basal ganglia is used to denote a number of subcortical nuclear masses that lie in the inferior part of the cerebral hemisphere, in close relationship with the internal capsule (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 31.1</span></a>). The traditional definition of the basal ganglia included the corpus striatum, claustrum and amygdaloid complex. The term has now been restricted to the corpus striatum and, according to some authorities, other nuclei in the diencephalon and midbrain (principally the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra) that collectively form a functional complex involved in the control of movement and motivational aspects of behaviour (<a href="#bib549" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_549">Jankovic 2012</a>).

The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that mediate these disorders have been much studied in recent years and are better understood than for any other type of complex neurological dysfunction (<a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_22">Penney and Young 1986</a>, <a href="#bib549" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Jankovic 2012</a>).

However, although the name has been retained in gross anatomical terminology and in some compound names (e.g. sublenticular, retrolenticular thalamic projections), the putamen and globus pallidus have quite different connections and functions.

The globus pallidus is itself divided into two segments, a lateral (external) segment and a medial (internal) segment, separated by an internal medullary lamina. The two segments have distinct afferent and efferent connections. Inferiorly, a little behind the fundus striati, the lentiform complex is grooved by the anterior commissure that connects inferior parts of the temporal lobes and the anterior olfactory cortex of the two sides (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 31.6</a>).

The vast bulk of the caudate nucleus and putamen are often referred to as the dorsal striatum. A smaller inferomedial part of the rostral striatum, referred to as the ventral striatum, includes the nucleus accumbens. The caudate and putamen are traversed by the anterior thalamic projections and by numerous small bundles of thinly myelinated, or unmyelinated, small-diameter axons, which are mostly striatal afferents and efferents. They radiate through the striatal tissue as though converging on, or radiating from, the globus pallidus. These bundles are occasionally referred to by the archaic term ‘Wilson’s pencils’ and they account for the striated appearance of the corpus striatum.</div><section><a id="s0025"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0035">Caudate nucleus</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0045">The caudate nucleus is a curved, tadpole-shaped mass. It has a large anterior head that tapers to a body, and a down-curving tail (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 31.4</span></a>). The head is covered with ependyma and lies in the floor and lateral wall of the frontal (anterior) horn of the lateral ventricle, anterior to the interventricular foramen. The tapering body is in the floor of the body of the ventricle, and the narrow tail follows the curve of the temporal (inferior) horn, and so lies in the ventricular roof, in the temporal lobe. Medially, the greater part of the caudate nucleus abuts the thalamus, along a junction that is marked by a groove, the sulcus terminalis. The sulcus contains the stria terminalis, lying deep to the ependyma (<a href="#f0030"><span class="bold">Fig. 31.5</span></a>). The sulcus terminalis is especially prominent anterosuperiorly (because of the large size of the head and body of the caudate nucleus relative to the tail), and here the stria terminalis is accompanied by the thalamostriate vein.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="505" id="pagebreak_505"/><a id="pg505"/></div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0025"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000318/main.assets/f31-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0025"/><a id="fspara0025"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 31.4</span> The striatum within the left cerebral hemisphere. <br/><span class="figcredit">With permission from Crossman AR, Neary D Neuroanatomy: An Illustrated Colour Text, 6th ed.

The two are separated by the fronto-occipital fasciculus laterally and by the subcallosal fasciculus, which caps the nucleus, medially (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 31.5</a>).

Variable bridges of cells connect the putamen to the caudate nucleus for most of its length.

Anterior to the anterior commissure, much of the grey matter of the anterior perforated substance, and especially the olfactory tubercle, is indistinguishable from, and continuous with, the fundus striati, in terms of cellular composition, histochemistry and interconnections. The caudate nucleus is continuous medially with the nucleus accumbens (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 31.6A</a>), which abuts the nuclei of the septum, close by the para-olfactory area, diagonal band of Broca and the fornix.</div><div class="text" id="p0060">The nucleus accumbens receives a dopaminergic innervation from the midbrain ventral tegmental area (cell group A10). It is believed to represent the neural substrate for the rewarding effects of several classes of drugs and is, therefore, a major determinant of their addictive potential. The experimental observation that the locomotor activating effects of psychomotor stimulant drugs such as amphetamine and cocaine (which act presynaptically on dopaminergic neurones to either enhance dopamine release or block its reuptake) are dependent on dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens, led to the hypothesis that the reinforcing or rewarding properties of these drugs are mediated by the mesolimbic dopamine system.</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0045">Striatal connectivity</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0065">Neurones of both dorsal and ventral striatum are mainly medium-sized multipolar cells. They have round, triangular or fusiform cell bodies, mixed with a smaller number of large multipolar cells. The ratio of medium to large cells is at least 20:1. The large neurones have extensive spherical or ovoid dendritic trees up to 60<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm across. The medium-sized neurones also have spherical dendritic trees, approximately 20<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm across, which receive the synaptic terminals of many striatal afferents. The dendrites of both medium and large striatal cells may be either spiny or non-spiny. The most common neurone (approximately 75% of the total) is a medium-sized cell with spiny dendrites (so-called medium spiny neurones). These cells utilize γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as their transmitter and also express the genes coding for either enkephalin or substance P/dynorphin, depending on their efferent connections. Enkephalinergic neurones express D2 dopamine receptors. Substance P/dynorphin neurones express D1 receptors. These neurones are the major, and perhaps exclusive, source of striatal efferents to the pallidum and substantia nigra pars reticulata. The other medium-sized striatal neurones are aspiny, and are intrinsic cells that contain acetylcholinesterase (AChE), choline acetyltransferase (CAT) and somatostatin. Large neurones with spiny dendrites contain AChE and CAT; most, perhaps all, are intrinsic neurones. Aspiny large neurones are all intrinsic neurones.</div><div class="text" id="p0070">Intrinsic synapses are probably largely asymmetric (type II), while those derived from external sources are symmetric (type I). The aminergic afferents from the substantia nigra, raphe and locus coeruleus all end as profusely branching axons with varicosities that contain dense-core vesicles (the presumed store of amine transmitters). Many of these varicosities have no conventional synaptic membrane specializations, and may release transmitter in a way analogous to that found in peripheral postsynaptic sympathetic axons.</div><div class="text" id="p0075">Neuroactive chemicals, whether intrinsic or derived from afferents, are not distributed uniformly in the striatum. For example, 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) concentrations are highest caudally, while substance P, acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine are highest rostrally. However, there is a finer-grain neurochemical organization showing that the striatum consists of a mosaic of islands or striosomes (sometimes referred to as patches), each 0.5–1.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm across, packed into a background matrix. Striosomes contain substance P and enkephalin. During development, the first dopamine terminals from the substantia nigra are found in striosomes: although this exclusivity does not persist after birth, striosomes in the adult caudate nucleus still contain a higher concentration of dopamine than the matrix. The latter contains ACh and somatostatin, and is the target of thalamostriatal axons. Receptors for at least some neurotransmitters are also differentially distributed. For example, opiate receptors <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="506" id="pagebreak_506"/><a id="pg506"/>are found almost exclusively within striosomes, and muscarinic receptors predominantly so. Moreover, the distribution of neuroactive substances within the striosomes is not uniform. In humans, the striosome/matrix patchwork is more evident in the caudate than the putamen, the latter consisting predominantly of matrix.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">All afferents to the striatum terminate in a mosaic manner. The size of a cluster of terminals is usually 100–200<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm across. Some afferent terminal clusters are not arranged in register with the clear striosome/matrix distributions seen in nigrostriatal and thalamostriatal axons. In general, afferents from the neocortex end in striatal matrix and those from the allocortex end in striosomes. However, the distinction is not absolute: although afferents from the neocortex arise in layers V and VI, those from the superficial part of layer V end predominantly in striatal matrix, whereas those from deeper neocortex project to striosomes. Striatal cell bodies that are the sources of efferents also form clusters but, again, are not uniformly related to striosomes. For example, the cell bodies of some striatopallidal and striatonigral axons lie clustered within striosomes, but others lie outside them, still in clusters. The neurones and neuropil of the ventral striatum are essentially similar to those of the dorsal striatum, but the striosomal/matrix organization is less well-defined and seems to consist predominantly of striosomes.</div><div class="text" id="p0085">The major connections of the striatum are summarized in <a href="#f0045"><span class="bold">Fig. 31.8</span></a>. The connections of the dorsal and ventral divisions overlap, however, the generalization can be made that the dorsal striatum is predominantly connected with motor and associative areas of the cerebral cortex, whilst the ventral striatum is connected with the limbic system and orbitofrontal and temporal cortices. For both dorsal and ventral striatum, the pallidum and substantia nigra pars reticulata are key efferent structures. The fundamental arrangement is the same for both divisions. The cerebral cortex projects to the striatum, which in turn projects to the pallidum and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Efferents from the pallidum and substantia nigra pars reticulata influence the cerebral cortex (either the supplementary motor area or prefrontal and cingulate cortices via the thalamus) and the superior colliculus (see below).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0045"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000318/main.assets/f31-08-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0045"/><a id="fspara0045"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 31.8</span> Connections of the striatum.

Previously, these axons were thought to be collaterals of cortical efferents to other regions, but it is now known that they arise exclusively from small pyramidal cells in layers V and VI. It has also been suggested that some of the cells of origin lie in the supragranular ‘cortical association’ layers II and III. The projection is organized topographically. The greater part of the input from the cerebral cortex to the dorsal striatum is derived from the frontal and parietal lobes; the input from the occipitotemporal cortex is relatively small. The orbitofrontal association cortex projects to the inferior part of the head of the caudate nucleus, which lies next to the ventral striatum. The dorsolateral frontal association cortex and frontal eye fields project to the rest of the head of the caudate nucleus, and much of the parietal lobe projects to the body of the nucleus. The somatosensory and motor cortices project predominantly to the putamen: their terminals establish a somatotopic pattern, in which the lower body is represented laterally and the upper body is represented medially. The motor cortex is unique in also sending axons through the corpus callosum to the opposite putamen, where they end with the same spatial ordering. The occipital and temporal cortices project to the tail of the caudate nucleus and to the inferior putamen.</div><div class="text" id="p0095">The striatum receives afferents from the polysensory intralaminar thalamus and these are more crudely organized spatially. The nucleus centralis lateralis, which receives a cerebellar input, projects to the anterior striatum (especially the caudate nucleus), while the centromedian nucleus, which receives input from both the cerebellum and medial globus pallidus, projects to the putamen.</div><div class="text" id="p0100">The aminergic inputs to the caudate and putamen are derived from the substantia nigra pars compacta (dopaminergic group A9; see <a href="../B9780702077050000288/B9780702077050000288.xhtml#f0090">Fig. 28.17</a>), the retrorubral nucleus (dopaminergic group A8), the dorsal raphe nucleus (serotoninergic group B7) and the locus coeruleus (noradrenergic group A6). The nigrostriatal input is sometimes referred to as the ‘mesostriatal’ dopamine pathway; it reaches the striatum by traversing the H fields (of Forel) in the subthalamus and running in the medial forebrain bundle. These aminergic inputs appear to modulate the responses of the striatum to cortical and thalamic afferent influences.</div><div class="text" id="p0105">Efferents from the striatum pass to both segments of the globus pallidus and to the substantia nigra pars reticulata, where they end in a topically ordered fashion. Fibres ending in either the lateral or medial pallidum originate from different striatal cells (see <a href="#f0045">Fig. 31.8</a>). Those projecting to the lateral pallidum are axons of neurones that co-localize GABA and enkephalin, and give rise to the so-called ‘indirect pathway’. This name refers to the fact that these striatal neurones influence the activity of basal ganglia output neurones in the medial pallidum via the intermediary of the subthalamic nucleus. Other striatal neurones, which co-localize GABA and substance P/dynorphin, project directly to the medial pallidum and are, therefore, described as the ‘direct pathway’.</div><div class="text" id="p0110">The striatal projection to the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra also has both direct and indirect components, via the lateral pallidum and subthalamic nucleus (<a href="#f0055"><span class="bold">Figs 31.9</span></a>–<a href="#f0050"><span class="bold">31.10</span></a>).

Thus, the hippocampus (through the fornix) and orbitofrontal cortex (through the internal capsule) project to the nucleus accumbens, and the olfactory, entorhinal, anterior cingulate and temporal visual cortices project to both the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. The olfactory tubercle also receives afferents from the amygdala. The contiguity of the cortical areas that project to the ventral striatum and neighbouring dorsal striatum emphasizes the imprecise nature of the boundaries between these two divisions. All the cortical regions abut and overlap with neighbouring areas and they project to neighbouring parts of the dorsal striatum as well as to the ventral striatum. The fundus striati and ventromedial caudate nucleus abut the olfactory tubercle and nucleus accumbens (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 31.6A</a>) and receive connections from the orbitofrontal cortex and, to a lesser extent, from the lateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices (which also project to the head of the caudate nucleus).</div><div class="text" id="p0120">This continuity of the ventral and dorsal striata, as revealed by the arrangements of corticostriatal projections, is reinforced by consideration of the aminergic inputs to the ventral striatum. These are derived from the dorsal raphe (serotoninergic group B7), the locus coeruleus (noradrenergic group A6) and the ventral tegmental area (dopamine group A10), as well as the most medial part of the substantia nigra, pars compacta (A9) (see <a href="../B9780702077050000288/B9780702077050000288.xhtml#f0090">Fig. 28.17</a>). The dopamine projections constitute the so-called mesolimbic dopamine pathway, which also projects to the septal nuclei, hippocampus and amygdala, and the prefrontal and cingulate cortices through the medial forebrain bundle. The lateromedial continuity of cell groups A9 and A10 is reflected in the relative positions of their ascending fibres in the subthalamus and hypothalamus (the H fields and medial forebrain bundle, respectively), as well as in the lateromedial topography of the dorsal and ventral striata, which in turn have contiguous and overlapping sources of cortical afferents.</div><div class="text" id="p0125">As with the dorsal striatum, efferents from the ventral striatum project to the pallidum (in this case, the ventral pallidum) and the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="507" id="pagebreak_507"/><a id="pg507"/>substantia nigra pars reticulata (see <a href="#f0050">Figs 31.9</a>–<a href="#f0055">31.10</a>).

It consists of lateral (external) and medial (internal) segments separated by an internal medullary lamina. Both segments receive large numbers of fibres from the striatum and subthalamic nucleus, but they have substantially different connections. The lateral segment projects to the subthalamic nucleus as part of the ‘indirect pathway’. The medial segment is considered to be a homologue of the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, with which it shares similar cellular and connectional properties. Together, the segments constitute the main output of the basal ganglia to other levels of the neuraxis, principally to the thalamus.</div><div class="text" id="p0140">The cell density of the globus pallidus is less than one-twentieth that of the striatum. The morphology of the majority of cells is identical in the two segments, i.e. large multipolar GABAergic neurones which closely resemble the neurones in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Their dendritic fields are discoid, with planes at right-angles to incoming striatopallidal axons, each of which, therefore, potentially contacts many pallidal dendrites <span class="italic">en passant</span>.

They project to either the lateral or the medial pallidum. Those projecting to the lateral segment constitute the beginning of the ‘indirect pathway’. They utilize GABA as their primary transmitter and also contain enkephalin. Efferent axons from neurones in the lateral segment pass through the internal capsule in the subthalamic fasciculus and travel to the subthalamic nucleus (<a href="#f0060"><span class="bold">Fig. 31.11</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0060"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000318/main.assets/f31-11-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0060"/><a id="fspara0060"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 31.11</span> Coronal section of the brain showing the major connections of the basal ganglia with the diencephalon.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0150">Striatopallidal axons destined for the medial pallidum constitute the ‘direct pathway’. Like the indirect projection, these utilize GABA as their primary transmitter but they also contain substance P and dynorphin. Efferent axons from the medial pallidum project through the ansa lenticularis and fasciculus lenticularis (see <a href="#f0060">Fig. 31.11</a>). The former runs round the anterior border of the internal capsule and the latter penetrates the capsule directly. Having traversed the internal capsule, both pathways unite in the subthalamic region, where they follow a horizontal hairpin trajectory, and turn upwards to enter the thalamus as the thalamic fasciculus. The trajectory circumnavigates the zona incerta and creates the so-called ‘H’ fields of Forel (see <a href="#f0060">Figs 31.5</a>, <a href="#f0030">31.11</a>). Within the thalamus, pallidothalamic fibres end in the ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei and in the intralaminar centromedian nucleus. These in turn project excitatory (presumed glutamatergic) fibres primarily to the frontal cortex, including the primary and supplementary motor areas. The medial pallidum also projects fibres caudally to the pedunculopontine nucleus, as described below (see <a href="#f0055">Fig. 31.10</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0045"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0055">Subthalamic Nucleus</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0155">The subthalamic nucleus is a biconvex, lens-shaped nucleus in the subthalamus of the diencephalon. It lies medial to the internal capsule, immediately rostral to the level at which the latter becomes continuous with the crus cerebri of the midbrain (see <a href="#f0020">Figs 31.3</a>, <a href="#f0030">31.5</a>). Within the nucleus, small interneurones intermingle with large multipolar cells with dendrites that extend for about one-tenth the diameter of the nucleus. Dorsally, the nucleus is encapsulated by axons, many of which are derived from the subthalamic fasciculus and carry a major GABAergic projection from the lateral segment of the globus pallidus as part of the indirect pathway. The nucleus also receives afferents from the cerebral cortex. It is unique in the intrinsic circuitry of the basal ganglia in that its cells are glutamatergic and project excitatory axons to both the globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Within the pallidum, subthalamic efferent fibres end predominantly in the medial segment but many also end in the lateral segment.</div><div class="text" id="p0160">The subthalamic nucleus plays a central role in the normal function of the basal ganglia and in the pathophysiology of basal ganglia-related disorders. Destruction of the nucleus, which occurs rarely as a result of stroke, results in the appearance of violent, uncontrolled involuntary movements of the contralateral side of the body, known as ballism (hemiballismus). The subthalamic nucleus is crucially involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Mitchell et al 1989</a>) and is a target for functional neurosurgical therapy of the condition.

Briefly, it consists of a pars compacta, a pars reticulata and a smaller pars lateralis. The pars compacta and pars lateralis correspond to the dopaminergic cell group A9. The pars compacta projects heavily to the caudate nucleus and putamen; smaller projections end in the globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus. The neurones of the pars reticulata and the medial pallidum collectively constitute the output neurones of the basal ganglia system. In Parkinson’s disease, the levels of dopamine in the substantia nigra and striatum decrease dramatically as a result of the degeneration of pars compacta neurones and their terminals in the neostriatum.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="509" id="pagebreak_509"/><a id="pg509"/></div></section><section><a id="s0055"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0065">Pedunculopontine Nucleus</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0170">The pedunculopontine nucleus (nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus) lies in the dorsolateral part of the pontomesencephalic tegmentum (<a href="#bib678" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_678">Hamani et al 2007</a>). Anterograde tract-tracing studies in non-human primates and rodents have revealed multiple afferent and efferent connections between the pedunculopontine nucleus and the basal ganglia, cerebellum, substantia nigra, thalamus, cerebral cortex and spinal cord. The nucleus receives GABAergic efferent fibres from the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. In animal models of Parkinson’s disease, these projections are overactive and the pedunculopontine nucleus is inhibited. Taken in conjunction with other experimental evidence, this suggests that the pedunculopontine nucleus is involved in the pathophysiology of disturbances of locomotion, gait and posture in Parkinson’s disease (<a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Mena-Segovia et al 2004</a>).

As far as their role in movement control is concerned, they appear to promote and support patterns of behaviour that are appropriate in the prevailing circumstances and to inhibit unwanted or inappropriate movements. This is exemplified by disorders of the basal ganglia, which are characterized, depending on the underlying pathology, by either an inability to initiate and execute wanted movements (as in Parkinson’s disease) or an inability to prevent unwanted movements (as in Huntington’s disease).</div><div class="text" id="p0180">Parkinson’s disease is the most common pathological condition affecting the basal ganglia. It is characterized by akinesia, muscular rigidity and tremor due to degeneration of the dopaminergic neurones of the substantia nigra pars compacta (which project to the striatum in the nigrostriatal pathway). As a consequence, dopamine terminals are lost in the striatum and dopamine levels are severely depleted: dopamine receptors located on medium spiny neurones, which are the target of the nigrostriatal pathway, are spared.</div><div class="text" id="p0185">Dopamine appears to have a dual action on medium spiny striatal neurones. It inhibits those of the indirect pathway and excites those of the direct pathway: when dopamine is lost from the striatum, the indirect pathway therefore becomes overactive and the direct pathway becomes underactive (<a href="#f0065"><span class="bold">Fig. 31.12</span></a>). Overactivity of the striatal projection to the lateral pallidum results in inhibition of pallidosubthalamic neurones and, consequently, overactivity of the subthalamic nucleus. Subthalamic efferents mediate excessive excitatory drive to the medial globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. This is exacerbated by underactivity of the GABAergic, inhibitory direct pathway. Overactivity of basal ganglia output then inhibits the motor thalamus and its excitatory thalamocortical connections. While this description is little more than a first approximation of the underlying pathophysiology, this model of the basis of parkinsonian symptoms has led to the introduction of new neurosurgical approaches to the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, based upon lesioning and deep brain stimulation of the medial globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus (see below).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0065"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000318/main.assets/f31-12-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0065"/><a id="fspara0065"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 31.12</span> The pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (<span class="bold">A</span>) and dyskinesias (<span class="bold">B</span>). <br/><span class="figcredit">Adapted with permission from Crossman AR, Neary D Neuroanatomy: An Illustrated Colour Text, 6th ed.

Whilst these usually provide good symptomatic relief for many years, eventually they lead to the development of side-effects, including dyskinesias. The involuntary movements that occur as a consequence of long-term treatment of Parkinson’s disease resemble those seen in Huntington’s disease, i.e. tardive dyskinesia and ballism. Experimental evidence suggests that these may share a common neural mechanism (<a href="#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_19">Mitchell et al 1985</a>, <a href="#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_21">Mitchell et al 1992</a>) (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 31.12</a>). Thus, the indirect pathway becomes underactive, e.g. due to the effects of dopaminergic drugs in Parkinson’s disease, or the degeneration of the striatopallidal projection to the lateral pallidum in Huntington’s disease. This leads to physiological inhibition of the subthalamic nucleus by overactive pallidosubthalamic neurones. The involvement of the subthalamic nucleus explains why the dyskinetic movements of levodopa-induced dyskinesia and Huntington’s disease resemble those of ballism produced by a lesion of the subthalamic nucleus. Underactivity of the subthalamic nucleus removes the excitatory drive from medial pallidal neurones, which are known to be underactive in dyskinesias (<a href="#bib399" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_399">Crossman 1990</a>). Once again, this anatomical model of basal ganglia function is an oversimplification. Whilst it is true that underactivity of the medial globus pallidus is associated with dyskinesias, it is also known that lesions of the globus pallidus alleviate them. This so-called ‘pallidotomy paradox’ suggests that the dynamic aspects of pallidal and nigral efferent activity are important factors in the generation of dyskinesia (<a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Marsden and Obeso 1994</a>). A more recent ‘rate model’ of basal ganglia function hypothesizes that specific components oscillate in neuronal synchrony at different frequencies to select specific voluntary motor patterns (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">Little and Brown 2014</a>). Both rodent electrophysiology and recording from deep brain electrodes implanted in patients with Parkinson’s disease suggest that neuronal activity suppression in the 8–30<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>Hz beta frequency band correlates with relief of parkinsonian akinesia and rigidity by both dopamine and subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation.</div><div class="text" id="p0195">There is evidence that dysfunction of the basal ganglia is also involved in other complex, less well understood, behavioural disorders. In animal experiments, lesions of the basal ganglia, especially of the caudate nucleus, induce uncontrollable hyperactivity (e.g. obstinate progression, incessant pacing and other constantly repeated behaviours). This and other evidence has led to the notion that the corpus striatum enables an individual to make motor choices and avoid ‘stimulus-bound’ behaviour. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies in humans have shown that sufferers from obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), which is characterized by repeated ritualistic motor behaviour and intrusive thoughts, exhibit abnormal activity in the prefrontal cortex and caudate nuclei. There are similar suggestive observations in childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Huntington’s disease and Tourette’s syndrome. In this respect, it may be significant that the basal ganglia, besides receiving connections from the frontal lobe and limbic cortices, also have an ascending influence on the prefrontal and cingulate cortices through the substantia nigra pars reticulata and dorsomedial and ventromedial thalamus in parallel, functionally segregated, cortico-striato-thalamic circuits that subserve locomotor, oculomotor, cognitive and affective behaviour (<a href="#bib299" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_299">Alexander et al 1986</a>; see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 31.9</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0200">Before the advent of levodopa therapy, neurosurgery for Parkinson’s disease was commonplace.

With the arrival of levodopa <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="510" id="pagebreak_510"/><a id="pg510"/>therapy, which very effectively alleviates akinesia, the surgical treatment of Parkinson’s disease underwent a progressive decline. It soon became clear, however, that long-term use of levodopa was associated with a number of side-effects such as dyskinesias, ‘wearing-off’ and the ‘on–off’ phenomenon. More recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of movement disorders, and of Parkinson’s disease in particular, have stimulated a renaissance in the use of neurosurgery to treat movement disorders.</div><div class="text" id="p0205">Lesioning the subthalamic nucleus in experimental primates made parkinsonian with the neurotoxin MPTP dramatically alleviated the parkinsonian symptoms, suggesting that the subthalamic nucleus might be an appropriate clinical target (<a href="#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_24">Pereira and Aziz 2006</a>).

It did not become a widespread reality until the late 1980s, when it was facilitated by technological advances. The introduction of the technique of deep brain stimulation (DBS), which avoids making permanent lesions, made bilateral surgery safer. There have been numerous reports of the effectiveness of both bilateral pallidal and subthalamic nucleus stimulation in Parkinson’s disease (<a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_26">Rodriguez-Oroz et al 2012</a>; <a href="#f0070"><span class="bold">Figs 31.13</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0075"><span class="bold">31.14</span></a>). Subthalamic nucleus stimulation is largely favoured for relieving akinesia and rigidity, with pallidal stimulation considered to ameliorate dyskinesias if cognition and speech are at risk. Subthalamic stimulation is more effective than pallidal stimulation in allowing patients to reduce their anti-parkinson medication. Isolated tremor syndromes are best relieved by stimulation of either the contralateral ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus or the zona incerta.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0070"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000318/main.assets/f31-13-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0070"/><a id="fspara0070"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 31.13</span> Magnetic resonance image with CT overlaid showing the placement of deep brain stimulation electrodes (white dots) bilaterally in the globus pallidus of a patient with dystonia <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Mr E Pereira, St George’s, University of London.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0075"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000318/main.assets/f31-14-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0075"/><a id="fspara0075"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 31.14</span> Magnetic resonance image with CT overlaid showing the placement of deep brain stimulation electrodes (white dots) bilaterally in the subthalamic nucleus of a patient with Parkinson’s disease. <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Mr E Pereira, St George’s, University of London.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0220">Another manifestation of basal ganglia dysfunction is dystonia, which is characterized by increased muscle tone and abnormal postures. Dystonia may occur as a consequence of levodopa treatment in Parkinson’s disease or inherited disease (e.g. early-onset torsion, or Oppenheim’s dystonia, an autosomal dominant disorder most commonly associated with a mutation in the <span class="italic">DYT1</span> gene that encodes torsin A). Although the pathophysiological basis of dystonia is unclear (<a href="#bib564" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_564">Hallett 2006</a>), it is probably caused by underactivity of basal ganglia output. The observation that painful dystonic posturing of the limbs in parkinsonian patients responds dramatically to bilateral pallidal stimulation led to the development of bilateral pallidal stimulation for dystonia. Intriguingly, in dystonia the pallidal neurones are believed to fire at rates below normal, and so it is open to question how this stimulation works. Moreover, while the effect of stimulation is immediate in the case of Parkinson’s disease, in dystonia the improvement may take weeks to emerge, suggesting that the neural mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of stimulation for this condition is different and implicating a role for neuroplasticity in dystonia. Targeting of the subthalamic nucleus and ventral intermediate thalamus for both phasic and tonic components of craniocervical dystonia has an immediate effect and shows great promise.</div><div class="text" id="p0225">Another recent neurosurgical development in the therapy of Parkinson’s disease has involved targeting the pedunculopontine nucleus, which both receives fibres from and sends fibres to basal ganglia and related nuclei.

Future directions include miniaturization and ‘closed loop’ stimulation where neuronal oscillations are recorded from the deep brain electrodes and responded to, either for more effective stimulation
