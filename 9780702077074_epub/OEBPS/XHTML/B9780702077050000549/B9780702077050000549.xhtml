The lungs reside in the thoracic cavity, surrounded by the pleura. Inspiration and expiration occur via changes in intrathoracic volume caused by the movements of the respiratory diaphragm and thoracic cage. The trachea represents the start of a branching tubular network dedicated to air transport. The trachea is held open by cartilaginous C-shaped rings throughout its descent into the thorax. In the thorax the trachea bifurcates into right and left main bronchi, which enter the respective lungs. In the lung the main bronchi branch into lobar bronchi, then segmental bronchi. Each segmental bronchus supplies a single bronchopulmonary segment, the self-contained functional unit of the lung. Within each bronchopulmonary segment, the bronchioles lead to clusters of alveolar sacs. The alveolar walls are formed by type I and type II pneumocytes, creating a blood–air barrier with the alveolar capillaries. These capillary beds engulf the alveoli, where gas exchange rapidly occurs. It is at this level that deoxygenated blood arrives via the pulmonary arteries, and newly oxygenated blood is returned to the heart via the pulmonary veins. Bronchial arteries, veins and lymphatics, and the pulmonary plexuses, principally supply and the lung tissue.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">alveoli; bronchi; bronchopulmonary; hilum; lung; pleura; pneumocyte; pulmonary; segment; trachea</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The lungs are the essential organs of respiration and are responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. The functional anatomy of the thorax and respiratory diaphragm facilitates this complex process. Acting together, the muscles of respiration and the diaphragm increase the intrathoracic volume, creating a negative pressure within the pleural space that causes air influx and lung expansion (<a href="../B9780702077050000550/B9780702077050000550.xhtml#c0055">Ch. 55</a>). The resultant reduction in intra-alveolar pressure prompts the flow of air down the pressure gradient, through the upper respiratory tract, trachea, bronchi and bronchioles, and finally into the alveoli, where gaseous exchange occurs. Conversely, a decrease in the intrathoracic volume increases intra-alveolar pressure, causing the expiration of air. The combined expiratory movements of the thorax and abdomen do not clear the lung of its gas with each breath; the presence of a large residual volume of gas minimizes the degree to which each new inspiration of air can affect the composition of gas in diffusion exchange with the blood (<a href="#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">Lambertsen 1980</a>). Besides efficient oxygen diffusion from alveolar air to blood, the lungs must also provide an inefficient carbon dioxide transfer, thus maintaining a stable carbon dioxide blood and tissue pressure, much higher (38–42<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mmHg) than that in the atmosphere. Maintenance of critical homeostasis for carbon dioxide pressure is of greater importance than precise control of oxygen because so many essential electrical and metabolic functions depend on the hydrogen ion concentration [H<sup>+</sup>] of the fluids in which these functions are carried out.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">The process of breathing exposes the lung to noxious agents, including gases, dust particles, bacteria and viruses, and to dehydration and temperature extremes. The mucous barrier (including its cellular and immunoglobulin factors), the mucociliary escalator, branching pattern of the airways and the cough reflex are all anatomical defences against these insults. Studies of trends of particle deposition in children and young adults have shown that pulmonary deposition fractions are highest in infants who are at greatest risk from exposure to airborne particulate matter (<a href="#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_8">Asgharian et al 2004</a>). Respiratory function may be compromised by either anatomical defects such as chest wall abnormalities, or by paralysis of respiratory muscles or regional pain. Similarly, ultrastructural abnormalities, such as ciliary dysfunction (as seen in Kartagener’s syndrome), lead to recurrent respiratory infections and airway damage.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Pleura</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0020">Each lung is covered by a double-layered serous membrane, the parietal and visceral pleura, arranged as a closed, invaginated sac. The visceral pleura adheres closely to the lung surface and follows the interlobar fissures, separately covering each lobe of the lung. In the region of the lung hilum, the visceral pleura lifts off the mediastinal surface of the lung, and continues along the lung root for a short distance before folding back (reflecting) on itself to continue as the mediastinal parietal pleura (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 54.1</span></a>). The parietal pleura covers the lateral mediastinal margins (forming its lateral boundary), most of the respiratory diaphragm and the corresponding half of the thoracic wall.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000549/main.assets/f54-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 54.1</span> Reflections and recesses of the parietal pleura. <br/><span class="figcredit">Adapted with permission from Drake RL, Vogl AW, Mitchell A et al (eds) Gray’s Atlas of Anatomy, 2nd ed.

It incorporates an intervening thin film of pleural fluid that allows close sliding contact between the two layers during all phases of respiration. The pleural fluid has a high daily turnover: fluid is produced at 0.01–0.02<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>ml/kg/h and is continuously absorbed to maintain a pleural fluid level of 0.1–0.2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>ml/kg. Fluid movement and absorption are supported by a balance between plasmatic and pleural (hydrostatic and oncotic) pressures and thoracic lymphatic drainage. Pleural effusions occur when the mechanisms that normally resorb the fluid are destabilized.</div><div class="text" id="p0030">The negative pressure developed in the pleural cavity during inspiration is the result of the opposing outward pull of the chest wall and the inward elastic recoil of the lung. Any change in the elasticity of these structures or accumulation of fluid or air within the pleural cavity will alter respiratory activity either regionally or globally. Inter-regional disparities in ventilation normally exist as a result of local differences in thoracic expansion and position-related, gravity-dependent gradients in pleural pressure, and are reflected as regional inequalities in gas exchange.</div><div class="text" id="p0035">The right and left pleural sacs are separate compartments. Their parietal layers touch posterior to the superior half of the body of the sternum at the anterior junction line (see <a href="../B9780702077050000537/B9780702077050000537.xhtml#f0025">Fig. 53.4B</a>), and come close to each other, or may touch, posterior to the oesophagus and level with the bodies of the third to fifth thoracic vertebrae at the posterior junctional line. Both lines are visible on radiographs and/or cross-sectional imaging (see <a href="../B9780702077050000562/B9780702077050000562.xhtml#f0095">Fig. 56.20</a>); changes in the appearance of either line can indicate pathology. More inferiorly, the descending aorta (on the left) and azygos vein (on the right) demarcate the medial extent of the posterior parts of the pleural sacs. Cardiac asymmetry dictates that the left pleural cavity may sometimes be smaller. Transudates accumulate earlier and more often within the larger right pleural cavity.</div><div class="text" id="p0040">Some of the folded portions of the pleura at its sites of reflection or recess (e.g. retrosternal, interlobar fissures and the azygo-oesophageal recess), or regions of contact between the left and right pleural cavity (e.g. anterior/posterior junctional lines) are the only parts of normal pleura that can be visualized radiologically. Demonstration of significant pleural shadowing in any other region usually implies pathological pleural abnormality. At direct inspection of the pleural cavity, as during thoracoscopy, both the parietal and visceral pleura appear translucent; the underlying thoracic muscles and blood vessels are visible beneath the parietal pleura, and the lung and subpleural vascular network are visible beneath the visceral pleura, rendering the latter grey and variegated in appearance.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1021" id="pagebreak_1021"/><a id="pg1021"/></div><section><a id="s0015"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0025">Parietal pleura</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0045">Although continuous, different regions of parietal pleura are customarily distinguished by name according to the region they contact. The costal (costovertebral) part lines the internal surface of the thoracic wall and the lateral aspects of the vertebral bodies and intervening intervertebral discs; the diaphragmatic part covers the superior (thoracic) surface of the respiratory diaphragm; the cervical part (pleural dome) covers the inferior surface of the suprapleural membrane (in the region of the lung apex); and the mediastinal part covers the structures between the lungs and within the mediastinum, and forms the lateral border of the mediastinum. The surface markings of the parietal pleura are described in <a href="../B9780702077050000525/B9780702077050000525.xhtml#c0052">Chapter 52</a>.</div><section><a id="s0020"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0030">Costal part</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0050">The costal part of the parietal pleura lines the sternum, the lateral margins of the vertebral bodies and intervening intervertebral discs, the ribs and transversus thoracis and the intercostal muscles. External to the pleura, and located within the extrapleural space is the endothoracic fascia, a thin layer of loose connective tissue analogous to the transversalis fascia of the abdominal wall. Anteriorly, the costal pleura begins posterior to the sternum, where it is continuous with the mediastinal pleura along a line extending inferomedially, from posterior to the sternoclavicular joint to posterior to the sternal angle in the midline (see <a href="../B9780702077050000537/B9780702077050000537.xhtml#f0025">Fig. 53.4B</a>). From here, the right and left costal pleurae descend in contact with each other to the level of the fourth costal cartilage and then diverge. On the right side, the pleura descends almost vertically to reach the posterior aspect of the xiphisternal joint, while on the left it diverges laterally and descends at a distance of 3–5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm from the sternal margin to the anterior end of the sixth rib, forming the cardiac notch (pericardial triangle). On each side, the costal parietal pleura passes laterally, lining the internal surfaces of the costal cartilages, ribs, transversus thoracis and intercostal muscles. Posteriorly, it passes over the sympathetic trunk and its ganglia and splanchnic branches to reach the lateral sides of the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs, where it again is continuous with the mediastinal pleura. Superior to the first rib, the costal pleura is continuous with the cervical pleura; inferiorly, it becomes continuous with the diaphragmatic pleura along a line that differs slightly on the two sides. On the right, the line of costodiaphragmatic reflection (junction) begins posterior to the xiphoid process, passes posterior to the seventh costal cartilage to reach the eighth rib in the midclavicular line and the tenth rib in the mid-axillary line, then the twelfth rib (approximately level with the superior border of the spinous process of the twelfth thoracic vertebra) adjacent to the vertebral column. On the left, the line initially follows the sixth costal cartilage but then follows a course similar to that on the right. In neonates and young children, the domes of the respiratory diaphragm are lower and flatter, reducing the angle of this point of reflection.</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0035">Diaphragmatic part</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0055">The diaphragmatic part of the parietal pleura covers most of the superior (thoracic) surface of the respiratory diaphragm where it is tightly attached to the phrenicopleural fascia, a continuation of the endothoracic fascia.

It ascends medially from the internal border of the first rib to the apex of the lung, and then descends lateral to the trachea to become the mediastinal pleura. As a result of the obliquity of the first rib, the cervical pleura extends 3–4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm superior to the first costal cartilage, up to or above the level of the neck of the first rib, reaching as high as the body of the seventh cervical vertebra (see <a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Figs 54.1</span></a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000525/B9780702077050000525.xhtml#f0030">52.5</a>). The cervical pleura is strengthened by the suprapleural membrane (Sibson’s fascia), a thickening of the endothoracic fascia that is attached anteriorly to the internal border of the first rib and posteriorly to the anterior border of the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. Scalenus minimus, when present, extends from the anterior border of the transverse process of the fifth, sixth and/or seventh cervical vertebra to the inner border of the first rib behind the subclavian groove, the cervical pleura and the suprapleural membrane (which it tenses). The cervical pleura and suprapleural membrane are related to the supraclavicular part of the brachial plexus, the stellate (cervicothoracic) ganglion and the vertebral vessels; the subclavian artery passes laterally in a groove located anterior to the most superior level of the membrane (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 54.2</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000549/main.assets/f54-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 54.2</span> An inferior view of structures related superiorly to the cervical pleura and suprapleural membrane (both have been removed).</figcaption></figure></div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0045">Mediastinal part</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0065">The mediastinal part of the parietal pleura represents the lateral boundary of the mediastinum and forms a continuous covering above the level of the hilum of the lung, from the sternum anteriorly to the vertebral column posteriorly.

In quiet inspiration, the inferior margin of the lung does not reach the point of parietal pleural reflection and the costal and diaphragmatic parts of the pleura are separated by a narrow slit, the costodiaphragmatic recess; the lower limit of the lung is normally about 5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm superior to the lowest point of the recess. A similar costomediastinal recess exists between the mediastinum and the posterior surfaces of the sternum and costal cartilages, where the thin anterior margin of the lung projects toward the line of pleural reflection.

This may result in a ‘tension pneumothorax’, which can be life-threatening and should be suspected whenever there are unilateral decreased breath sounds, hypotension, jugular venous distension and contralateral tracheal deviation (due to mediastinal shift). A tension pneumothorax requires immediate decompression. This may be carried out using a wide-bore needle; or a decompression cannula apparatus, inserted into the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line; or via a thoracostomy with an incision made through the fourth or fifth intercostal space between the anterior and mid-axillary lines followed by digital insertion to breach the parietal pleura and sweep away pleural adhesions (<a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Fitzgerald et al 2008</a>), followed by tube insertion for longer-term drainage.</div><div class="text" id="p0125">Fluid collection in the pleural cavity may be due to congestive cardiac failure, hypoalbuminaemia or inflammatory, infective or neoplastic conditions. A developing pleural effusion causes obliteration of the costodiaphragmatic recess, where a lateral fluid meniscus is often visible from a non-loculated effusion on a frontal chest radiograph. Drainage of the fluid and subsequent analysis are required for diagnostic purposes. Where there is a collection of purulence (empyema) or blood, pleural cavity drainage is essential for therapeutic purposes. Ultrasonography is useful in assessing the size and characteristics of an effusion, such as the presence of loculation and debris and can demonstrate underlying consolidated lung.

When removed from the thorax, a fresh normal lung is spongy, can float in water, and crepitates when handled because of the air within its alveoli. It is also highly elastic and so retracts on removal from the thorax. Its surface is smooth and shiny, and is divided by fine, dark lines into numerous small polyhedral lobules, each crossed by numerous finer lines, indicating the areas of contact between its most peripheral lobules and the visceral pleural surface.</div><div class="text" id="p0140">In proportion to body stature, the lungs are heavier in males than in females (<a href="#bib46" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_46">Thurlbeck 1982</a>).

The subclavian artery arches superolaterally over the suprapleural membrane and grooves the anterior surface of the membrane and lung apex just below its highest point, separating it from scalenus anterior (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 54.2</a>). The cervicothoracic (stellate) sympathetic ganglion, ventral ramus of the first thoracic spinal nerve and supreme intercostal artery all lie posterior to the lung apex.

Since the respiratory diaphragm extends higher on the right than on the left, the concavity is deeper on the base of the right lung. Posterolaterally, the diaphragmatic surface has a more tapered shape that projects a little into the costodiaphragmatic recess. The change in diaphragmatic surface shape and relations is best viewed with inspiration/expiration radiographs, or with a ventilation CT series.</div></section><section><a id="s0105"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0105">Costal surface</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0160">The costal surface of the lung is smooth and convex, and its shape is adapted to that of the thoracic wall, which is vertically deeper posteriorly.

The hilum of the lung, posterosuperior to this concavity, is the area where various structures of the lung root enter or leave the lung. The lung root and hilum are surrounded by a sleeve of pleura that extends inferiorly, posterior to the cardiac impression, as the pulmonary ligament. The mediastinal surface and vertebral part of the costal surface are sometimes collectively termed the medial surface (border) of the lung.</div></section><section><a id="s0115"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0115">Other impressions on the lung surface</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0170">Cadaveric lungs that have been preserved <span class="italic">in situ</span> can show a number of other impressions that indicate their relations with surrounding structures, especially on the mediastinal surface (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 54.3</a>).

A wide groove ascends anterior to the hilum for the superior vena cava, the terminal portion of the right brachiocephalic vein and the right subclavian vein. Posteriorly, this groove is joined by a deep sulcus that arches forwards immediately superior to the hilum and is occupied by the azygos vein. The right side of the oesophagus makes a shallow vertical groove posterior to the hilum and the pulmonary ligament, and posterior to this is a vertical groove for the azygos vein. Towards the respiratory diaphragm it inclines left and leaves the right lung, and therefore does not reach the lower limit of this surface. Posteroinferiorly, the cardiac impression is confluent with a short, wide groove adapted to the inferior vena cava. Between the lung apex and the groove for the arch of the azygos vein, the trachea and right vagus nerve are close to the lung but do not mark it.</div><div class="text" id="p0180">On the mediastinal surface of the left lung (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 54.3B</a>), the cardiac impression is related to the anterolateral surface of the left ventricle and left auricle. The anterior surface of the conus arteriosus and adjoining part of the right ventricle are related to the lung as it ascends anterior to the hilum to accommodate the pulmonary trunk. A large groove arches over the hilum, and descends behind both it and the pulmonary ligament, corresponding to the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. From its summit, a narrower groove ascends to the apex for the left subclavian artery. Posterior to this, and superior to the aortic groove, the lung is impressed by the oesophagus (with potential contribution from the thoracic duct as it passes along the posterolateral surface of the oesophagus). Anterior to the groove for the subclavian artery there is a faint linear depression for the left brachiocephalic vein. Inferiorly, the oesophagus may create a groove posterior to the lower end of the pulmonary ligament.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0120"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0120">Pulmonary borders</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0185">The inferior border of the lung is thin and sharp where the diaphragmatic and costal surfaces extend into the costodiaphragmatic recess and meet, and more rounded medially where the diaphragmatic and mediastinal surfaces meet (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 54.3</a>). The surface anatomy of the inferior border of the lung is described in <a href="../B9780702077050000525/B9780702077050000525.xhtml#c0052">Chapter 52</a> (see <a href="../B9780702077050000525/B9780702077050000525.xhtml#f0030">Figs 52.5</a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000525/B9780702077050000525.xhtml#f0035">52.6</a>). The respiratory diaphragm rises more superiorly on the right to accommodate the liver, which means that the right lung is vertically shorter (by about 2–3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm) than the left. However, cardiac asymmetry means that the right lung is broader, and has a greater capacity and weight than the left. Although not obvious, the posterior border separates the costal surface from the mediastinal surface and corresponds to the region of the lung adjacent to the heads of the ribs. It has no recognizable markings and is represented by a rounded region where the costal and vertebral surfaces of the lung meet. The thin, sharp, anterior border of the lung overlaps the pericardium (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 54.7</a>). On the right it corresponds closely to the costomediastinal line of pleural reflection and is almost vertical. On the left it approaches the same line posterior to the sternum and superior to the fourth costal cartilage; inferior to this point it shows a variably shaped cardiac notch, the edge of which passes laterally for about 3.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm before curving inferomedially to the level of the sixth costal cartilage, about 4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm from the midline.

The azygos vein may sometimes course in a more lateral position, within a four-layered pleural septum within the superior lobe, creating an ‘azygos lobe’. This is not a true lobe, but a separated portion of the superior lobe that lacks its own bronchi, arteries or veins. The condition represents an incidental finding on chest radiographs or CT scans, with no associated morbidity; it may be confused with a pulmonary nodule, and loculated effusions may appear in the fissure.

There are normally two left bronchial arteries (superior and inferior) that branch separately from the descending thoracic aorta, although these may be singular and may also give rise to a right bronchial artery. Uncommon origins for the bronchial arteries include the abdominal aorta or the inferior phrenic, coronary, subclavian or internal thoracic arteries, or the brachiocephalic or thyrocervical trunks.

Other arterial branches ramify in interlobular loose connective tissue and most end in either deep or superficial bronchial veins; some also ramify on the surface of the lung, forming subpleural capillary plexuses.

Superficial bronchial veins drain extrapulmonary bronchi, visceral pleura and the hilar lymph nodes. They also communicate with the pulmonary veins and end in the azygos vein on the right, and in the left superior intercostal or the accessory hemiazygos vein on the left.

However, lymphatic vessels of adjoining lobes connect deep in the fissures which means that these connections are not exclusive. At the level of pulmonary lobation, the arrangement of lymphatic vessels follows the central artery of a lobule and its peripheral veins.

The predominant contractile innervation of airway smooth muscle is parasympathetic cholinergic, while the primary relaxant innervation of the airways is non-cholinergic (parasympathetic nerves containing nitric oxide synthase and vasoactive intestinal peptide). These parasympathetic nerves are anatomically and physiologically distinct and differentially regulated by reflexes. Stimulation of cholinergic nerves also results in mucus secretion and bronchial vasodilation. Sympathetic-adrenergic nerves play little, if any, role in directly regulating smooth muscle tone in the human airways, although they may control constriction of tracheobronchial blood vessels. Circulating noradrenaline (norepinephrine) can bring about bronchodilation through activation of β-adrenergic receptors in the airways.

Pulmonary arteries convey systemic deoxygenated blood to the alveolar walls and pulmonary veins drain oxygenated blood back to the left atrium for systemic distribution by the left ventricle. The much smaller bronchial arteries, derived from the systemic circulation, provide oxygenated blood to lung tissues that do not have close access to atmospheric oxygen, i.e. those of the bronchi and larger bronchioles (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 54.10</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0480">The pulmonary trunk bifurcates into right and left pulmonary arteries, each of which approaches the respective lung hilum via the lung root (<a href="#f0050"><span class="bold">Fig. 54.13</span></a>). Each pulmonary artery divides into branches that accompany the segmental and subsegmental bronchi, mostly in a posterolateral position. The pulmonary capillaries form single-layered, thin-walled plexuses immediately outside the epithelium in the walls and septa of the alveoli and alveolar sacs (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 54.11</a>). Pulmonary veins, two from each lung, drain the pulmonary capillaries; their rootlets coalesce into larger and more freely communicating veins that traverse the lung, for the most part independently of the pulmonary arteries and bronchi. Near the lung hilum, the pulmonary vessels accompany the main bronchial division, the veins lying anteromedial and the arteries posterolateral to the bronchi. This is not the case in the bronchopulmonary segments, where a segmental bronchus, its branches and associated arteries occupy a central position, whereas the many tributaries of the pulmonary veins run between segments, serving adjacent segments (which therefore drain into more than one vein). Some veins also lie beneath the visceral pleura, including the pleura in the interlobar fissures. It follows from this that a bronchopulmonary segment is not a complete vascular unit with an individual bronchus, artery and vein. During resection of segments, it is apparent that the planes between them are not avascular but are crossed by pulmonary veins and sometimes by branches of arteries. This relationship of bronchi, arteries and veins exhibits considerable variation, veins are the most variable and arteries are more variable than bronchi.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0050"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000549/main.assets/f54-12-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0050"/><a id="fspara0050"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 54.13</span> The relationship between the central airways and the pulmonary vessels.

A lymph node usually lies adjacent to the bifurcation. The smaller branch to the superior lobe usually divides again, supplying the majority of that lobe. The inferior branch descends anterior to the bronchus intermedius and posterior to the superior pulmonary vein. It provides a small recurrent branch to the superior lobe, and then, at the point where the horizontal fissure meets the oblique fissure, it gives off the branch to the middle lobe anteriorly, and a branch to the superior segment of the inferior lobe posteriorly.

The left recurrent laryngeal nerve branches from the left vagus nerve, passes inferior to the aortic arch to the left of the ligamentum arteriosum, and then courses superiorly posterior to the aortic arch; it is a close relation of the superior part of the left lung root and hilum, where it may be compressed or invaded by lung tumour.

Lingular branches arise within the fissure, and the rest of the lower lobe is supplied by many varied branching patterns.

The clinical abnormalities observed depend on the size of the embolus and on the number and frequency of embolic episodes. Large emboli may lodge in branches of the main pulmonary artery and cause right ventricular dysfunction and hypoxia, representing a medical emergency. Smaller emboli may lodge in segmental pulmonary arteries and cause pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath and haemoptysis, although the clinical picture is rarely pathognomonic. Pulmonary emboli cause a ventilation–perfusion ratio mismatch that can have serious physiological implications leading to a significant reduction in the oxygenation of blood. Ventilation–perfusion scans with radiolabelled xenon and technetium usually demonstrate segmental abnormalities in perfusion with normal ventilation in the corresponding regions. Pulmonary emboli may also be evaluated by contrast-enhanced spiral CT or pulmonary angiograms and appear as filling defects. Repetitive embolization may eventually lead to a dramatic reduction of the pulmonary vascular bed and chronic cor pulmonale.

They originate from capillary networks in the alveolar walls and return oxygenated blood to the left atrium: they are devoid of valves. All the main tributaries of the pulmonary veins receive smaller tributaries, both intra- and intersegmental. By serial junctions, tributaries ultimately form a single lobar trunk (one for each lobe). Usually, there are three trunks in the right lung and two in the left: variations reflect the lobar arrangement of an individual. The right middle and superior lobar veins usually unite so that two veins, superior and inferior, leave each lung at the hilum: the superior pulmonary vein is anteroinferior to the pulmonary artery, and the inferior pulmonary vein is the most inferior hilar structure and is also slightly posterior (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 54.3</a>). The right superior pulmonary vein is formed by the union of apical, anterior and posterior veins (draining the superior lobe) with a middle lobar vein formed by lateral and medial tributaries. The right inferior pulmonary vein is formed in the hilar region by the union of superior (apical) and common basal veins from the inferior lobe. The union of superior and inferior basal tributaries forms the common basal vein. Occasionally, the three right lobar veins remain separate. The right superior pulmonary vein passes posterior to the superior vena cava, and the inferior passes posterior to the right atrium.</div><div class="text" id="p0535">The left superior pulmonary vein is formed by the union of apicoposterior, anterior and lingular veins.

Inhaled air is humidified mainly in the upper respiratory tract, where it passes, with some turbulence, over the nasal and buccopharyngeal mucosae (<a href="../B9780702077050000392/B9780702077050000392.xhtml#c0039">Ch. 39</a>). The secretions of the various glands of the tracheobronchial tree also help to prevent desiccation. Goblet cells secrete sulphated acid mucins; cells in mucous glands beneath the epithelial surface contain mainly carboxylated mucins, particularly those associated with sialic acid, although sulphated groups also occur; cells of serous glands contain neutral mucins. Goblet cells respond mainly to local irritation, while tubular glands, both mucous and serous, are predominantly under neural and hormonal control.

It enhances clearance of secretions and particulates from the airways and protects from aspiration of foreign materials (occurring as a consequence of aspiration or inhalation of particulate matter, pathogens, accumulated secretions, postnasal drip, inflammation and mediators associated with inflammation). In some conditions coughing may become excessive, non-productive and potentially harmful to the airway mucosa.</div><div class="text" id="p0570">The mechanical events of a cough can be divided into three phases. An initial deep inhalation generates the volume necessary for an effective cough and is followed by a compression phase, when forceful contraction of the muscles of the chest wall, respiratory diaphragm and abdominal wall against a closed glottis results in a rapid rise in intrathoracic pressure. Subsequent glottal opening causes a rapid peak expiratory airflow that dislodges and expels mucus from the airways and this forceful airway compression produces the coughing sound.</div><div class="text" id="p0575">Coughing is initiated when mechanically and chemically sensitive vagal afferents that innervate the airways from the upper respiratory tract to the terminal bronchioles and lung parenchyma are activated (Morice and Geppetti 2004, <a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_13">Canning et al 2014</a>). Data from experimental studies suggest that the receptors innervated by these afferents may be broadly divided into three groups: slowly (SAR) and rapidly (RAR) adapting stretch receptors and bronchopulmonary unmyelinated C fibres (see below). The vagal afferents terminate centrally in largely non-overlapping regions of the caudal half of the nucleus tractus solitarius. Second-order neurones from this nucleus terminate on respiratory-related regions of the pons, medulla and spinal cord. Efferent impulses travel via the vagus, phrenic and spinal motor nerves to the inspiratory and expiratory muscles, larynx, respiratory diaphragm and abdominal wall muscles. Airway receptors in the external acoustic meatuses (external auditory canals), tympanic membranes, paranasal sinuses, pharynx, respiratory diaphragm, pleura, pericardium and stomach are probably mechanoreceptors, stimulated by triggers such as touch or displacement (<a href="#bib37" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_37">Polverino et al 2012</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0580">The specific pattern of a cough depends on the site and type of stimulation. Mechanical laryngeal stimulation results in immediate expiratory stimulation (sometimes termed the expiratory reflex), protecting the airway from aspiration; stimulation distal to the larynx causes a more prominent inspiratory phase to generate the airflow necessary to remove the stimulus.</div><div class="text" id="p0585">During vigorous coughing, intrathoracic pressures may reach 300<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mmHg (with an abrupt rise in pleural pressure from 6.5 to 13<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>kPa) and expiratory velocities approach 500 miles per hour (<a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Ford et al 2007</a>).

Cough can also be a symptom of tracheobronchomalacia, which results from the loss of rigid support of the large airways and inspiratory collapse, usually seen in conjunction with obstructive lung disease in patients with a history of tobacco smoking. Chronic dry cough may be caused by irritation of the external acoustic meatus by impacted foreign bodies or cerumen (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Jegoux et al 2002</a>). The aetiology of the ‘ear-cough’ (otorespiratory reflex) is related to stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (Arnold’s nerve) (<a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Feldman and Woodworth 1993</a>). Holmes–Adie syndrome is a rare cause of coughing when autonomic dysfunction affects the vagus nerve.

Laryngeal stimulation produces a choking type of cough without a preceding inspiration. Inadequate mucociliary clearance mechanisms (as in bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis) may produce a pattern of coughing with less violent acceleration of air and a sequence of interrupted expirations without any intervening inspiration.</div><div class="text" id="p0600">Since cough is an important defensive reflex required to maintain the health of the lungs, individuals who do not cough effectively are at risk of atelectasis, recurrent pneumonia and chronic airways disease from aspiration and retention of secretions. Many disorders can impair the ability to cough effectively and this may result in persistent cough.

Patients with paralysis or neuromuscular disorders (including rib fractures) and chest wall anomalies may not generate the flows necessary for effective clearance of secretions due to defective ‘pump’ mechanisms. Individuals with reduced function of the abdominal wall musculature are particularly at risk of ineffective cough. Individuals with laryngeal disorders (e.g. vocal fold paresis or paralysis), including those with tracheostomies, may not achieve sufficient laryngeal closure to generate the increased intrathoracic pressures necessary for an effective cough.</div><section><a id="s0365"/><section><a id="s0370"/><section><a id="s0375"/><section><a id="s0380"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0365">Rapidly adapting receptors (RAR)</p><div class="textfl" id="p0610">RARs are dynamic receptors that respond to changes in airway mechanical properties (e.g. diameter, length and interstitial pressures).

The rate of ciliary beating is usually 12–16 per second; mechanical stimulation of the epithelial surface and inflammatory mediators increase the rate. In addition to tight junctions, which seal the apical intercellular space from the airway lumen, the ciliated cells are coupled by gap junctions that allow a change in rate of beating to spread from stimulated cells to their neighbours (probably via calcium signalling) so that their metachronal coordination remains intact.

Along the entire intrapulmonary bronchial tree, smooth muscle forms two opposed helical tracts that become thinner and finally disappear at the level of the alveoli (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 54.11</a>). The tone of these muscle fibres is under nervous and hormonal control; groups of muscle cells are coupled by gap junctions to spread excitation within fascicles. Muscle cell contraction narrows the airway, while relaxation permits bronchodilation. Some tone normally exists in the muscular bands, which relax slightly during inspiration and contract during expiration, so assisting the tidal flow of air. Abnormal contraction may be caused by circulating smooth muscle stimulants or by local release of excitants such as 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin), histamine and leukotrienes, causing bronchospasm. Numerous mast cells are present in the connective tissue of the respiratory tree, especially towards the bronchioles.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0460"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0445">Microstructure of respiratory surfaces</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0730">Thin-walled respiratory surfaces (alveoli) are distributed as isolated patches within the walls of respiratory bronchioles and as tube-like alveolar ducts and balloon-like alveolar sacs that contain groups of adjacent alveoli (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 54.11</a>).</div><section><a id="s0465"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0450">Alveolar area</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0735">Each human lung contains approximately 300–500 million alveoli, giving a total surface area of 70–100<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>m<sup>2</sup>.

Type I pneumocytes are simple squamous epithelial cells and form over 90% of the alveolar area. In histological sections they are characterized by the protrusion of their nuclei from the alveolar surface. Their basal laminae fuse with that of the adjacent capillary endothelium to form the thin portions of interalveolar septa. Their thin cytoplasm (0.05–0.2 μm) facilitates gaseous diffusion between the lumen of the alveolus and its capillaries. The edges of adjacent cells overlap and are joined by tight junctions, creating a strict diffusion barrier between the alveolar surface and underlying tissues. Together with a similar endothelial barrier, this arrangement limits the movement of fluid from blood and interstitial spaces into the alveolar lumen (the blood–air barrier). If damaged, type I pneumocytes, which do not divide, are replaced by type II pneumocytes, which proliferate and differentiate into type I pneumocytes.</div><div class="text" id="p0755">The smaller type II cells are often more numerous than type I pneumocytes, but they contribute less than 10% of the alveolar surface area. In histological sections they are characterized by a brush-border projection from the alveolar surface. In the human lung, they are often associated with interalveolar pores of Kohn. Their cytoplasm contains numerous characteristic secretory lamellar bodies consisting of concentric whorls of phospholipid-rich membrane, the precursors of alveolar surfactant, which they can recycle (see <a href="#f0060">Fig. 54.19C</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0485"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0470">Interalveolar pores of Kohn</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0760">Interalveolar pores of Kohn are small pores lined by epithelium (usually type II pneumocytes), that cross interalveolar septa to link adjacent alveolar airspaces.

They originate in haemopoietic tissue in the bone marrow, migrate into the alveolar lumen from adjacent blood vessels and connective tissue, and ‘wander’ about on the epithelial surfaces. They clear the respiratory spaces of inhaled particles that are small enough to reach the alveoli (hence their alternative name of ‘dust cells’; see <a href="../B9780702077050000045/B9780702077050000045.xhtml#f0070">Fig. 4.13</a>). Most of them migrate with their phagocytosed load to the bronchioles, where they are swept into the mucociliary rejection current and removed from the lung. Others migrate through the epithelium of the alveoli into the lymphatics that drain the connective tissue of the lung, and so pass into lymphoid tissue around the pulmonary lobules. Under normal conditions, alveolar macrophages have a granular cytoplasm because they contain phagocytosed particles; in smokers, the particles have a characteristic appearance and are called ‘tar bodies’. When actively phagocytic, macrophages release proteases: if antiproteases such as α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin that are normally present in the alveolar lining are deficient, macrophage activity may damage the lung. Alveolar macrophages are involved in the turnover of surfactant.</div><div class="text" id="p0770">Alveolar macrophages can be recovered from sputum and are of diagnostic importance if they appear abnormal. For instance, whenever <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1036" id="pagebreak_1036"/><a id="pg1035.e1"/>erythrocytes leak from pulmonary capillaries, the macrophages that engulf the extravasated cells become brick-red and are detectable in ‘rusty’ sputum. They are typical of congestive heart failure and often termed ‘heart-failure cells’. Macrophages that migrate back into the connective tissue of the lung settle in patches that are visible beneath the visceral pleura, e.g. carbon-filled cells give the lungs a mottled appearance. However, if the inhaled particles are abrasive or chemically active, they may elude macrophage removal and damage the respiratory surface, producing fibrosis and a concomitant reduction in the respiratory area. This occurs in many industrial diseases, e.g. pneumoconiosis caused by coal dust, or asbestosis, where the long thin fibres of asbestos can cause considerable damage and may trigger fatal mesothelioma in the pleural lining.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0495"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0480">Pulmonary surfactant</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0775">The alveolar surface is normally covered by a film of pulmonary surfactant, a complex mixture mainly of phospholipids (particularly dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol), with some protein and neutral lipid. Surfactant is stored in lamellar bodies and secreted in the form of tubular myelin (unrelated to myelin of the nervous system) by type II pneumocytes. It is recycled by type II pneumocytes or cleared (i.e. phagocytosed) by alveolar macrophages. Clara cells of the bronchiolar epithelium are thought to secrete surfactant of a different composition.</div><div class="text" id="p0780">Surface tension at the alveolar surface is very high because the alveoli are minute and spherical, features that oppose expansion during inspiration and tend to collapse the alveoli in expiration. The detergent-like properties of pulmonary surfactant greatly reduce the surface tension and make ventilation of the alveoli much more efficient. As the volume of an alveolus alternatively increases and decreases, so does its surface area. With a fixed amount of surfactant in the alveolar film, the relative concentration of surfactant increases on exhalation. The fortunate result is a decrease in collapsing tendency as the alveolar volume decreases, stabilizing the alveolus and overcoming the tendency of small gas spaces to obliterate.</div></section></section></section></section><footer><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1037.e1" id="pagebreak_1037.e1"/><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebib0015"/><h2 class="reftitle" id="s0505">References</h2><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebibsec0010"/><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib5"><!--<a hreef="#bib_5">5</a>. --><a id="ref0030"/><a href="#bib_5">Akgun</a> V, Hamcan S, Bozkurt Y, et al. <cite>Thoracic aorta</cite>. In: Tubbs R.S, Shoja M.M, Loukas M, eds. <cite><i>Bergman’s Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Human Anatomic Variation</i></cite>. 2nd ed. Hoboken: Wiley Blackwell; 2016:501–529 Ch. 49.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib6"><!--<a hreef="#bib_6">6</a>. --><a id="ref0035"/><a href="#bib_6">Alison</a> M, Garel L, Bigras J.L, et al. <cite>Unilateral absence of pulmonary artery in children: bronchovascular anatomy, natural course and effect of treatment on lung growth</cite>. <cite><i>Pediatr Radiol</i></cite>. 2011;41:459–468.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib7"><!--<a hreef="#bib_7">7</a>. --><a id="ref0040"/><a href="#bib_7">Archie</a> J.G, Collins J.S, Lebel R.R. <cite>Quantitative standards for fetal and neonatal autopsy</cite>. <cite><i>Am J Clin Pathol</i></cite>. 2006;126:256–265.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib8"><!--<a hreef="#bib_8">8</a>. --><a id="ref0045"/><a href="#bib_8">Asgharian</a> B, Menache M.G, Miller F.J. <cite>Modeling age-related particle deposition in humans</cite>. <cite><i>J Aerosol Med</i></cite>. 2004;17:213–224.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib9"><!--<a hreef="#bib_9">9</a>. --><a id="ref0050"/><a href="#bib_9">Belvisi</a> M.G. <cite>Overview of the innervation of the lung</cite>. <cite><i>Curr Opin Pharmacol</i></cite>. 2002;2:211–215.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib10"><!--<a hreef="#bib_10">10</a>. --><a id="ref0055"/><a href="#bib_10">Canning</a> B.J, Fischer A. <cite>Neural regulation of airway smooth muscle tone</cite>. <cite><i>Respir Physiol</i></cite>. 2001;125:113–127.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib11"><!--<a hreef="#bib_11">11</a>. --><a id="nspara1805"/><span class="italic">This article clarifies the effects of parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves on airway smooth muscle.</span></p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib12"><!--<a hreef="#bib_12">12</a>. --><a id="ceotherref0010"/><a id="cetextref0010"/><a href="#bib_10">Canning</a> BJ, Reynolds SM, Mazzone SB 2001 Multiple mechanisms of reflex bronchospasm in guinea pigs.
