The book is a rarity in textbook publishing in having been in continuous publication on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean since 1858, an exceptionally long era for a textbook. Of course, the volume now is very different from the one Mr Henry Gray first created with his colleague Dr Henry Vandyke Carter in mid-Victorian London. In this introductory essay, I shall explain the long history of <span class="italic">Gray’s</span>, from those Victorian days right up to today.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0015">The shortcomings of existing anatomical textbooks probably impressed themselves on Henry Gray when he was still a student at St George’s Hospital Medical School, near London’s Hyde Park Corner, in the early 1840s. He began thinking about creating a new anatomy textbook a decade later, while war was being fought in the Crimea. New legislation was being planned that would establish the General Medical Council (1858) to regulate professional education and standards.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0020">Gray was 28 years old, and a teacher himself at St George’s. He was very able, hard-working and highly ambitious, already a Fellow of the Royal Society and of the Royal College of Surgeons. Although little is known about his personal life, his was a glittering career so far, achieved while he served and taught on the hospital wards and in the dissecting room (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 1</span></a>) (<a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_1">Anon 1908</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050020103/main.assets/fm01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 1</span> Henry Gray (1827–1861) is shown here in the foreground, seated by the feet of the cadaver. The photograph was taken by a medical student, Joseph Langhorn. The room is the dissecting room of St George’s Hospital Medical School in Kinnerton Street, London. Gray is shown surrounded by staff and students. When the photo was taken, on 27 March 1860, Carter had left St George’s, to become Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Grant Medical College, in Bombay (nowadays Mumbai). The second edition of <span class="italic">Gray’s Anatomy</span> was in its proof stages, to appear in December 1860. Gray died just over a year later, in June 1861, at the height of his powers.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="para_indented" id="p0025">Gray shared the idea for the new book with a talented clinical colleague on the teaching staff at St George’s, Henry Vandyke Carter, in November 1855. Carter was from a family of Scarborough artists, and was himself a talented artist and experienced microscopist (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 2</span></a>). He had produced fine illustrations for Gray’s scientific publications before, but could see that this idea was a much more complex project. Carter recorded in his diary:</div><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050020103/main.assets/fm02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 2</span> Henry Vandyke Carter (1831–1897).

Gray made proposal to assist by drawings in bringing out a Manual for students: a good idea but did not come to any plan … too exacting, for would not be a simple artist’ <span class="italic">(</span><a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_3"><span class="italic">Carter 1855</span></a><span class="italic">)</span>.</p></div></div><div class="para_indented" id="p0030">Neither of these young men was interested in producing a pretty book, or an expensive one. Their purpose was to supply an affordable, accurate teaching aid for people like their own students, who might soon be required to operate on real patients, or on soldiers injured at Sebastopol or some other battlefield. The book they planned together was a practical one, designed to encourage youngsters to study anatomy, help them pass exams and assist them as budding surgeons. It was not simply an anatomy textbook, but a guide to dissecting procedure, and to the major operations.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0035">Gray and Carter belonged to a generation of anatomists ready to infuse the study of human anatomy with a new, and respectable, scientificity. Disreputable aspects of the profession’s history, acquired during the days of body-snatching, were assiduously being forgotten. The Anatomy Act of 1832 had legalized the requisition of unclaimed bodies from workhouse and hospital mortuaries, and the study of anatomy (now with its own Inspectorate) was rising in respectability in Britain. The private anatomy schools that had flourished in the Regency period were closing their doors, and the major teaching hospitals were erecting new, purpose-built dissection rooms (<a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_10">Richardson 2000</a>).</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0040">The best-known student works when Gray and Carter had qualified were probably Erasmus Wilson’s <span class="italic">Anatomist’s Vade Mecum</span>, and <span class="italic">Elements of Anatomy</span> by Jones Quain. Both works were small – pocket-sized – but Quain came in two thick volumes. Their small pages of dense type, and even smaller illustrations, were somewhat daunting, seeming to demand much nose-to-the-grindstone effort from the reader.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0045">The planned new textbook’s dimensions and character were serious matters. Pocket manuals were commercially successful because they appealed to students by offering much knowledge in a small compass. But pocket-sized books had button-sized illustrations. Knox’s <span class="italic">Manual of Human Anatomy</span>, for example, was only 6 inches by 4 (15 × 10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span> cm) and few of its illustrations occupied more than one-third of a page. Gray and Carter must have discussed this matter between themselves, and with Gray’s publisher, JW Parker &amp; Son, before decisions were taken about the size and girth of the new book, and especially the size of its illustrations. While Gray and Carter were working on the book, a new edition of <span class="italic">Quain’s</span> was published; this time it was a ‘triple-decker’ – in three volumes – of 1740 pages in all.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0050">The two men were earnestly engaged for the following 18 months in work for the new book. Gray wrote the text, and Carter created the illustrations; all the dissections were undertaken jointly. Their working days were long – all the hours of daylight, eight or nine hours at a stretch – right through 1856, and well into 1857. We can infer from the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="xv.e2" id="pagebreak_xv.e2"/><a id="pgxv.e2"/>warmth of Gray’s appreciation of Carter in his published acknowledgements that their collaboration was a happy one.</div><div><div id="disp0015"><p class="quote" role="doc-epigraph" epub:type="epigraph" id="p0275">‘The Author gratefully acknowledges the great services he has derived in the execution of this work, from the assistance of his friend, Dr. H. V. Carter, late Demonstrator of Anatomy at St George’s Hospital. All the drawings from which the engravings were made, were executed by him, <span class="italic">(</span><a href="#bib4" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_4"><span class="italic">Gray 1858</span></a><span class="italic">).</span></p></div></div><div class="para_indented" id="p0055">With all the dissections completed, and Carter’s inscribed wood-blocks at the engravers, Gray took six months’ leave from his teaching at St George’s to work as a personal doctor for a wealthy family. It was probably as good a way as any to get a well-earned break from the dissecting room and the dead-house (<a href="#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_8">Nicol 2002</a>).</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0060">Carter sat the examination for medical officers in the East India Company, and sailed for India in the spring of 1858, when the book was still in its proof stages. Gray had left a trusted colleague, Timothy Holmes, to see it through the press. Holmes’s association with the first edition would later prove vital to its survival. Gray looked over the final galley proofs, just before the book finally went to press.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0010">The First Edition</h2><div class="para_fl" id="p0065">The book Gray and Carter had created together, <span class="italic">Anatomy, Descriptive and Surgical</span>, appeared at the very end of August 1858, to immediate acclaim. Reviews in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> and the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> were highly complimentary, and students flocked to buy.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0070">It is not difficult to understand why it was a runaway success. <span class="italic">Gray’s Anatomy</span> knocked its competitors into a cocked hat. It was considerably smaller and more slender than the doorstopper with which modern readers are familiar. The book held well in the hand, it felt substantial, and it contained everything required. To contemporaries, it was small enough to be portable, but large enough for decent illustrations: ‘royal octavo’ – 9½ × 6 inches (24 × 15<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm) – about two-thirds of modern A4 size. Its medium-size, single-volume format was far removed from <span class="italic">Quain’s</span>, yet double the size of Knox’s <span class="italic">Manual</span>.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0075">Simply organized and well designed, the book explains itself confidently and well; the clarity and authority of the prose are manifest. But what made it unique for its day was the outstanding size and quality of the illustrations. Gray thanked the wood engravers Butterworth and Heath for the ‘great care and fidelity’ they had displayed in the engravings, but it was really to Carter that the book owed its extraordinary success.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0080">The beauty of Carter’s illustrations resides in their diagrammatic clarity, quite atypical for their time. The images in contemporary anatomy books were usually ‘proxy-labelled’: dotted with tiny numbers or letters (often hard to find or read) or bristling with a sheaf of numbered arrows, referring to a key situated elsewhere, usually in a footnote, which was sometimes so lengthy it wrapped round on to the following page. Proxy labels require the reader’s eye to move to and fro: from the structure to the proxy label to the legend and back again. There was plenty of scope for slippage, annoyance and distraction. Carter’s illustrations, by contrast, unify name and structure, enabling the eye to assimilate both at a glance. We are so familiar with Carter’s images that it is hard to appreciate how incredibly modern they must have seemed in 1858. The volume made human anatomy look new, exciting and accessible.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0085">The first edition was covered in a brown bookbinder’s cloth embossed all over in a dotted pattern, and with a double picture-frame border. Its spine was lettered in gold blocking:</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0090"><span class="bold">GRAY’S</span></div><div class="para_indented" id="p9870"><span class="bold">ANATOMY</span></div><div class="para_indented" id="p0095">with ‘DESCRIPTIVE AND SURGICAL’ in small capitals underneath. <span class="italic">Gray’s Anatomy</span> is how it has been referred to ever since. Carter was given credit with Gray on the book’s title page for undertaking all the dissections on which the book was based, and sole credit for all the illustrations, though his name appeared in a significantly smaller type, and he was described as the ‘Late Demonstrator in Anatomy at St George’s Hospital’ rather than being given his full current title, which was Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Grant Medical College, Bombay. Gray was still only a Lecturer at St George’s and he may have been aware that his words had been upstaged by the quality of Carter’s anatomical images. He need not have worried: Gray is the famous name on the spine of the book.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0100">Gray was paid £150 for every thousand copies sold. Carter never received a royalty payment, just a one-off fee at publication, which may have allowed him to purchase the long-wished-for microscope he took with him to India.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0105">The first edition print-run of 2000 copies sold out swiftly. A parallel edition was published in the United States in 1859, and Gray must have been deeply gratified to have to revise an enlarged new English edition in 1859–60, though he was surely saddened and worried by the death of his publisher, John Parker junior, at the young age of 40, while the book was going through the press. The second edition came out in the December of 1860 and it too sold like hot cakes.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0110">The following summer, in June 1861, at the height of his powers and full of promise, Henry Gray died unexpectedly at the age of only 34. Gray had contracted smallpox while nursing his nephew. A new strain of the disease was more virulent than the one with which Gray had been vaccinated as a child; the disease became confluent, and Gray died in a matter of days.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0115">Within months, the whole country would be pitched into mourning for the death of Prince Albert. The creative era over which he had presided – especially the decade that had flowered since the Great Exhibition of 1851 – would be history.</div></section><section><a id="s0015"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0015">The Book Survives</h2><div class="para_fl" id="p0120"><span class="italic">Anatomy Descriptive and Surgical</span> could have died too. With Carter in India, the death of Gray, so swiftly after that of the younger Parker, might have spelled catastrophe. Certainly, at St George’s there was a sense of calamity. The grand old medical man Sir Benjamin Brodie, Sergeant-Surgeon to the Queen, and to whom <span class="italic">Anatomy</span> had been dedicated, was a great supporter of Gray and cried forlornly: ‘Who is there to take his place?’ (<a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Anon 1908</a>).</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0125">But old JW Parker ensured the survival of <span class="italic">Gray’s</span> by inviting Timothy Holmes, the doctor who had helped proof-read the first edition, and who had filled Gray’s shoes at the medical school, to serve as Editor for the next edition. Other long-running anatomy works, such as that of Quain, remained in print in a similar way, co-edited by other hands (<a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Quain 1856</a>).</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0130">Holmes (1825–1907) was another gifted St George’s man, a scholarship boy who had won an exhibition to Cambridge, where his brilliance was recognized. He was a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons at 28. John Parker junior had commissioned him to edit <span class="italic">A System of Surgery</span> (1860–64), an important essay series by distinguished surgeons on subjects of their own choosing. Many of Holmes’s authors remain important figures, even today: John Simon, James Paget, Henry Gray, Ernest Hart, Jonathan Hutchinson, Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard and Joseph Lister. Holmes had lost an eye in an operative accident, and he had a gruff manner that terrified students, yet he published a lament for young Parker that reveals him capable of deep feeling (<a href="#bib5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_5">Holmes 1860</a>).</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0135">John Parker senior’s heart, however, was no longer in publishing. His son’s death had closed down the future for him. The business, with all its stocks and copyrights, was sold to Messrs Longman and Parker retired to the village of Farnham, where he later died.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0140">With Holmes as editor, and Longman as publisher, the immediate future of <span class="italic">Gray’s Anatomy</span> was assured. The third edition appeared in 1864 with relatively few changes, Gray’s estate receiving the balance of his royalty after Holmes was paid £100 for his work.</div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">The Missing Obituary</h2><div class="para_fl" id="p0145">Why no obituary appeared for Henry Gray in <span class="italic">Gray’s Anatomy</span> is curious. Gray had referred to Holmes as his ‘friend’ in the preface to the first edition, yet it would also be true to say that they were rivals. Both had just applied for a vacant post at St George’s, as Assistant Surgeon. Had Gray lived, it is thought that Holmes may not have been appointed, despite his seniority in age (<a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Anon 1908</a>).</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0150">Later commentators have suggested, as though from inside knowledge, that Holmes’s ‘proof-reading’ included improving Gray’s writing style. This could be a reflection of Holmes’s own self-regard, but there may be some truth in it. There can be no doubt that, as Editor of seven subsequent editions of <span class="italic">Gray’s Anatomy</span> (third to ninth editions, 1864–1880), Holmes added new material, and had to correct and compress passages, but it is also possible that, back in 1857, Gray’s original manuscript had been left in a poor state for Holmes to sort out. In other works, Gray’s writing style was lucid, but he always seems to have paid a copyist to transcribe his work prior to submission. The original manuscript of <span class="italic">Gray’s Anatomy</span>, sadly, has not survived, so it is impossible to be sure how much of the finished version had actually been written by Holmes.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="xv.e3" id="pagebreak_xv.e3"/><a id="pgxv.e3"/></div><div class="para_indented" id="p0155">It may be that Gray’s glittering career, or perhaps the patronage that unquestionably advanced it, created jealousies among his colleagues, or that there was something in Gray’s manner that precluded affection, or that created resentments among clever social inferiors like Carter and Holmes, especially if they felt their contributions to Gray’s brilliant career were not given adequate credit. Whatever the explanation, no reference to Gray’s life or death appeared in <span class="italic">Gray’s Anatomy</span> itself until the twentieth century (<a href="#bib6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_6">Howden et al 1918</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0025">A Succession of Editors</h2><div class="para_fl" id="p0160">Holmes expanded areas of the book that Gray himself had developed in the second edition (1860), notably in ‘general’ anatomy (histology) and ‘development’ (embryology). In Holmes’s time as Editor, the volume grew from 788 pages in 1864 to 960 in 1880 (ninth edition), with the histological section paginated separately in roman numerals at the front of the book. Extra illustrations were added, mainly from other published sources.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0165">The connections with Gray and Carter, and with St George’s, were maintained with the appointment of the next editor, T. Pickering Pick, who had been a student at St George’s in Gray’s time. From 1883 (tenth edition) onwards, Pick kept up with current research, rewrote and integrated the histology and embryology into the volume, dropped Holmes from the title page, removed Gray’s preface to the first edition, and added bold subheadings, which certainly improved the appearance and accessibility of the text. Pick said he had <span class="italic">‘tried to keep before himself the fact that the work is intended for students of anatomy rather than for the Scientific Anatomist’</span> (thirteenth edition, 1893).</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0170">Pick also introduced colour printing (in 1887, eleventh edition) and experimented with the addition of illustrations using the new printing method of half-tone dots: for colour (which worked) and for new black-and-white illustrations (which did not). Half-tone shades of grey compared poorly with Carter’s wood engravings, still sharp and clear by comparison.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0175">What Henry Vandyke Carter made of these changes is a rich topic for speculation. He returned to England in 1888, having retired from the Indian Medical Service full of honours, and in 1890 he was made Honorary Physician to Queen Victoria. Carter had continued researching throughout his clinical medical career in India, and became one of India’s foremost bacteriologists/tropical disease specialists before there was really a name for either discipline. He made some important discoveries, including the fungal cause of mycetoma, which he described and named, and he was a key figure in confirming scientifically in India some major international discoveries, such as Hansen’s discovery of the cause of leprosy, Koch’s discovery of the organism causing tuberculosis and Laveran’s discovery of the organism that causes malaria. Carter married late in life, and his wife was left with two young children when he died in Scarborough in 1897, aged 65. Like Gray, he received no obituary in the book, but unlike Gray, Carter received an obituary in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> that celebrated not only his achievements in India but also <span class="italic">‘those excellent illustrations for Gray’s Anatomy which have … contributed so materially to smooth the thorny path of the student of human anatomy’</span> (<a href="#bib2" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_2">BMJ 1897</a>).</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0180">When Pick was joined on the title page by Robert Howden (a professional anatomist from the University of Durham) in 1901 (fifteenth edition), the volume was still easily recognizable as the book Gray and Carter had created. Although many of Carter’s illustrations had been revised or replaced, many others still remained. Sadly, though, an entire section (embryology) was again separately paginated, because its revision had taken longer than anticipated. <span class="italic">Gray’s Anatomy</span> had grown, seemingly inexorably, and was now quite thick and heavy: 1244 pages, weighing 5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>lb 8<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>oz/2.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>kg. Both co-editors, and perhaps also its publisher, were dissatisfied with it.</div></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0030">Key Edition: 1905</h2><div class="para_fl" id="p0185">Serious decisions were taken well in advance of the next edition, which turned out to be Pick’s last with Howden. Published 50 years after Gray had first suggested the idea to Carter, the 1905 (sixteenth) edition was a landmark one.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0190">The period 1880–1930 was a difficult time for anatomical illustration, because the new techniques of photo-lithography and half-tone were not as yet perfected, and in any case could not provide the bold simplicity of line required for a book like <span class="italic">Gray’s</span>, which depended so heavily on clear illustration and clear lettering. Recognizing the inferiority of half-tone illustrations by comparison with Carter’s wood-engraved originals, Pick and Howden courageously decided to jettison the second-rate half-tones altogether. Most of the next edition’s illustrations were either Carter’s, or old supplementary illustrations inspired by his work, or newly commissioned wood engravings or line drawings, intended ‘to harmonize with Carter’s original figures’. They successfully emulated Carter’s verve. Having fewer pages and lighter paper, the 1905 (sixteenth edition) weighed less than its predecessor, at 4 <span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>lb 11<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>oz/2.1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>kg. Typographically, the new edition was superb.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0195">Howden took over as sole editor in 1909 (seventeenth edition) and immediately stamped his personality on <span class="italic">Gray’s</span>. He excised ‘Surgical’ from the title, changing it to <span class="italic">Anatomy Descriptive and Applied</span>, and removed Carter’s name altogether. He also instigated the beginnings of an editorial board of experts for <span class="italic">Gray’s</span>, by adding to the title page ‘Notes on Applied Anatomy’ by AJ Jex-Blake and W Fedde Fedden, both St George’s men. For the first time, the number of illustrations exceeded one thousand. Howden was responsible for the significant innovation of a short historical note on Henry Gray himself, nearly 60 years after his death, which included a portrait photograph (1918, twentieth edition).</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0035">The Nomenclature Controversy</h2><div class="para_fl" id="p0200">Howden’s era, and that of his successor TB Johnston (of Guy’s), was overshadowed by a cloud of international controversy concerning anatomical terminology. European anatomists were endeavouring to standardize anatomical terms, often using Latinate constructions, a move resisted in Britain and the United States. <span class="italic">Gray’s</span> became mired in these debates for over 20 years. The attempt to be fair to all sides by using multiple terms doubtless generated much confusion amongst students, until a working compromise was at last arrived at in 1955 (thirty-second edition, 1958).</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0205">Johnston oversaw the second retitling of the book (in 1938, twenty-seventh edition): it was now, officially, <span class="italic">Gray’s Anatomy</span>, finally ending the fiction that it had ever been known as anything else. <span class="italic">Gray’s</span> suffered from paper shortages and printing difficulties in World War II, but successive editions nevertheless continued to grow in size and weight, while illustrations were replaced and added as the text was revised.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0210">Between Howden’s first sole effort (1909, seventeenth edition) and Johnston’s last edition (1958, thirty-second edition), <span class="italic">Gray’s</span> expanded by over 300 pages – from 1296 to 1604 pages, and almost 300 additional illustrations brought the total to over 1300. Johnston also introduced X-ray plates (1938) and, in 1958 (thirty-second edition), electron micrographs by AS Fitton-Jackson, one of the first occasions on which a woman was credited with a contribution to <span class="italic">Gray’s</span>. Johnston felt compelled to mention that she was ‘a blood relative of Henry Gray himself’, perhaps by way of mitigation.</div></section><section><a id="s0040"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0040">After World War II</h2><div class="para_fl" id="p0215">The editions of <span class="italic">Gray’s</span> issued in the decades immediately following World War II give the impression of intellectual stagnation. Steady expansion continued in an almost formulaic fashion, with the insertion of additional detail. The central historical importance of innovation in the success of <span class="italic">Gray’s</span> seems to have been lost sight of by its publishers and editors: Johnston (1930–1958, twenty-fourth to thirty-second editions), J Whillis (co-editor with Johnston, 1938–1954), DV Davies (1958–1967, thirty-second to thirty-fourth editions) and F Davies (co-editor with DV Davies 1958–1962, thirty-second to thirty-third editions). <span class="italic">Gray’s</span> had become so pre-eminent that perhaps complacency crept in, or editors were too daunted or too busy to confront the ‘massive undertaking’ of a root and branch revision (<a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_13">Tansey 1995</a>). The unexpected deaths of three major figures associated with <span class="italic">Gray’s</span> in this era, James Whillis, Francis Davies and David Vaughan Davies – each of whom had been ready to take the editorial reins – may have contributed to retarding the process. The work became somewhat dull.</div></section><section><a id="s0045"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0045">Key Edition: 1973</h2><div class="para_fl" id="p0220">DV Davies had recognized the need for modernization, but his unexpected death left the work to other hands. Two Professors of Anatomy at Guy’s, Roger Warwick and Peter Williams, the latter of whom had been involved as an indexer for <span class="italic">Gray’s</span> for several years, regarded it as an honour to fulfil Davies’s intentions.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0225">Their thirty-fifth edition of 1973 was a significant departure from tradition. Over 780 pages (of 1471) were newly written, almost a third of the illustrations were newly commissioned, and the captions for the illustrations were freshly written throughout. With a complete <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="xv.e4" id="pagebreak_xv.e4"/><a id="pgxv.e4"/>re-typesetting of the text in larger double-column pages, a new index and the innovation of a bibliography, this edition of <span class="italic">Gray’s</span> looked and felt quite unlike its 1967 (thirty-fourth edition) predecessor, and much more like its modern incarnation.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0230">This 1973 edition departed from earlier volumes in other significant ways. The editors made explicit their intention to try to counter the impetus towards specialization and compartmentalization in twentieth-century medicine, by embracing and attempting to reintegrate the complexity of the available knowledge. Warwick and Williams openly renounced the pose of omniscience adopted by many textbooks, believing it important to accept and mention areas of ignorance or uncertainty. They shared with the reader the difficulty of keeping abreast in the sea of research, and accepted with a refreshing humility the impossibility of fulfilling their own ambitious programme.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0235">Warwick and Williams’s 1973 edition had much in common with Gray and Carter’s first edition. It was bold and innovative – respectful of its heritage, while also striking out into new territory. It was visually attractive and visually informative. It embodied a sense of a treasury of information laid out for the reader (<a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_14">Williams and Warwick 1973</a>). It was published simultaneously in the United States (the American <span class="italic">Gray’s</span> had developed a distinct character of its own in the interval), and sold extremely well there (<a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Williams and Warwick 1973</a>).</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0240">The influence of the Warwick and Williams edition was forceful and long-lasting, and set a new pattern for the following quarter-century. As has transpired several times before, wittingly or unwittingly, a new editor was being prepared for the future: Professor Susan Standring (of Guy’s and subsequently King’s College London), who created the new bibliography for the 1973 edition of <span class="italic">Gray’s</span>, went on to serve on the editorial board, and has served as Editor-in-Chief for the last three editions before this one (2005–2016, thirty-ninth, fortieth and forty-first editions). These editions are important for different reasons.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0245">For the thirty-ninth edition, the entire content of <span class="italic">Gray’s</span> was reorganized, from systematic to regional anatomy. This great sea-change was not just organizational but historic, because, since its outset, <span class="italic">Gray’s</span> had prioritized bodily systems, with subsidiary emphasis on how the systems interweave in the regions of the body. Professor Standring explained that this regional change of emphasis had long been asked for by readers and users of <span class="italic">Gray’s</span>, and that new imaging techniques had raised the clinical importance of regional anatomy (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">Standring 2005</a>). The change was facilitated by an enormous collective effort on the part of the editorial team and the illustrators. The subsequent and current editions, now also containing a substantial online-only component including an imaging library, consolidate that momentous change (see <a href="#t0010"><span class="bold">Table 1</span></a>).<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="xv.e5" id="pagebreak_xv.e5"/><a id="pgxv.e5"/></div><div class="pageavoid"><p class="tnum">Table 1</p><div class="big_device"><table id="t0010" class="tbody"><caption class="ttitle"><a id="tspara0010"/><span class="italic">Gray’s Anatomy</span> Editions</caption><thead><tr><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">Edition</th><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">Date</th><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">Author/Editor(s)</th><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">Publisher</th><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">Title</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope="row" class="tb" rowspan="2">1st</th><td class="tb" rowspan="2">1858</td><td class="tb">Henry Gray</td><td class="tb">JW Parker &amp; Son</td><td class="tb" rowspan="18"><span class="italic">Anatomy Descriptive and Surgical</span></td></tr><tr><td class="tb" colspan="2"><span class="italic">The drawings by Henry Vandyke Carter.

From this forty-second edition of <span class="italic">Gray’s Anatomy</span>, we can look back to appraise the long-term value of their efforts. We can discern how the book they created triumphed over its competitors, and has survived pre-eminent. <span class="italic">Gray’s</span> is a remarkable publishing phenomenon. Although the volume now looks quite different to the original, and contains so much more, its kinship with the <span class="italic">Gray’s Anatomy</span> of 1858 is easily demonstrable by direct descent, every edition updated by Henry Gray’s successor.
