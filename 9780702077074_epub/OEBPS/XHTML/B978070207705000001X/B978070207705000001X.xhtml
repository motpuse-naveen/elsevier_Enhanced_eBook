   id="abspara0010">This chapter presents relevant aspects of the structure of the mammalian cell within a functional, molecular and clinical context. The chapter emphasizes the most recent concepts leading to an understanding of the mechanisms of normal cell function and human disease. The components of a generalized cell are outlined. The plasma membrane is the gate that regulates homeostasis between the internal and external cell environment. The system of cytomembranes, represented by the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, contributes to homeostasis and also provides the cell with a functional identity. The cytoskeleton provides the framework for cell plasticity and contributes tracks for the intracellular mobilization of cargoes and cell displacement. Organelles, such as the mitochondrion and lysosome, provide an energy source and housekeeping. A number of cell signalling programmes coordinate normal cell function. Yet, cells have a finite life and can be disposed of by a programmed cell death mechanism that protects neighbouring cells from a premature deadly fate.</p></div></div></section>-->

                  with each other, their extracellular environment and internal structures. Their surfaces are often
                  highly folded when absorptive or transport functions take place across their boundaries. Cell size is
                  limited by rates of diffusion, either that of material entering or leaving cells, or that of diffusion
                  within them. Movement of macromolecules can be much accelerated and also directed by processes of
                  active transport across the plasma membrane and by transport mechanisms within the cell. According to
                  the location of absorptive or transport functions, apical microvilli (<a href="#f0010"><span

                  cytoplasm or specific organelles from one part of the cell to another. It also includes: the extension
                  of parts of the cell surface such as pseudopodia, lamellipodia, filopodia and microvilli; locomotion
                  of entire cells, as in the amoeboid migration of tissue macrophages; the beating of flagella or cilia
                  to move the cell (e.g. in spermatozoa) or fluids overlying it (e.g. in respiratory epithelium); cell
                  division; and muscle contraction. Cell movements are also involved in the uptake of materials from
                  their environment (endocytosis, phagocytosis) and the passage of large molecular complexes out of
                  cells (exocytosis, secretion).</div>
               <div class="text" id="p5003">Epithelial cells rarely operate independently of each other and commonly
                  form aggregates by adhesion, often assisted by specialized intercellular junctions. They may also
                  communicate with each other, either by generating and detecting molecular signals that diffuse across
                  intercellular spaces, or more rapidly by generating interactions between membrane-bound signalling
                  molecules. Cohesive groups of cells constitute tissues, and more complex assemblies of tissues form

                  cytoplasm. All cells, except mature red blood cells, also contain a nucleus that is surrounded by a
                  nuclear membrane or envelope (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 1.1</a>; <a href="#f0015"><span
                        class="bold">Fig. 1.2</span></a>). The nucleus includes: the genome of the cell contained within
                  the chromosomes; the nucleolus; and other subnuclear structures. The cytoplasm contains cytomembranes
                  and several membrane-bound structures, called organelles, which form separate <span
                     role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="5" id="pagebreak_5" /><a id="pg5" />and distinct
                  compartments within the cytoplasm. Cytomembranes include the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum
                  and Golgi apparatus, as well as vesicles derived from them. Organelles include lysosomes, peroxisomes
                  and mitochondria. The nucleus and mitochondria are enclosed by a double-membrane system; lysosomes and
                  peroxisomes have a single bounding membrane. There are also non membrane-bound structures, called
                  inclusions, which lie free in the cytosolic compartment. They include glycogen aggregates and pigments
                  (e.g. lipofuscin). In addition, ribosomes and several filamentous protein networks, known collectively
                  as the cytoskeleton, are found in the cytosol. The cytoskeleton determines general cell shape and
                  supports specialized extensions of the cell surface (microvilli, cilia, flagella). It is involved in
                  the assembly of specific structures (e.g. centrioles) and controls cargo transport in the cytoplasm.
                  The cytosol contains many soluble proteins, ions and metabolites.</div>

                  <div class="textfl" id="p5006">Cells are enclosed by a distinct plasma membrane, which shares features
                     with the cytomembrane system that compartmentalizes the cytoplasm and surrounds the nucleus. All
                     membranes are composed of lipids (mainly phospholipids, cholesterol and glycolipids) and proteins,
                     in approximately equal ratios. Plasma membrane lipids form a lipid bilayer, a layer two molecules
                     thick. The hydrophobic ends of each lipid molecule face the interior of the membrane and the
                     hydrophilic ends face outwards. Most proteins are embedded within, or float in, the lipid bilayer
                     as a fluid mosaic. Some proteins, because of extensive hydrophobic regions of their polypeptide
                     chains, span the entire width of the membrane (transmembrane proteins), whereas others are only
                     superficially attached to the bilayer by lipid groups. Both are integral (intrinsic) membrane
                     proteins, as distinct from peripheral (extrinsic) membrane proteins, which are membrane-bound only
                     through their association with other proteins. Carbohydrates in the form of oligosaccharides and
                     polysaccharides are bound either to proteins (glycoproteins) or to lipids (glycolipids), and
                     project mainly into the extracellular domain (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig.

                           phospholipid bilayer and allow the protein to ‘float’ in the plane of the membrane. Some
                           proteins are restricted in their freedom of movement where their cytoplasmic domains are
                           tethered to the cytoskeleton.</figcaption>

                     sphingomyelin and cholesterol. The ability of select subsets of proteins to partition into
                     different lipid microdomains has profound effects on their function, e.g. in T-cell receptor and
                     cell–cell signalling. The highly organized environment of the domains provides a signalling,

                     the hydrophobic portion of the bilayer, where the hydrophobic tails of phospholipids meet, and
                     split the bilayer into two leaflets. Each cleaved leaflet has a surface and a face. The surface of
                     each leaflet faces either the extracellular surface (ES) or the intracellular or protoplasmic
                     (cytoplasmic) surface (PS). The extracellular face (EF) and protoplasmic face (PF) of each leaflet
                     are artificially produced during membrane splitting. This technique has also demonstrated
                     intramembranous particles embedded in the lipid bilayer; in most cases, these represent large
                     transmembrane protein molecules or complexes of proteins. Intramembranous particles are distributed
                     asymmetrically between the two half-layers, usually adhering more to one half of the bilayer than
                     to the other. In plasma membranes, the intracellular leaflet carries most particles, seen on its
                     face (the PF). Where they have been identified, clusters of particles usually represent channels
                     for the transmembrane passage of ions or molecules between adjacent cells (gap junctions).</div>

                        bilayer. Specific transport proteins, such as carrier proteins and channel proteins, mediate the
                        selective passage of molecules across the membrane, thus allowing the cell to control its
                        internal composition. Molecules (such as oxygen and carbon dioxide) can cross the plasma
                        membrane down their concentration gradients by dissolving first in the phospholipid bilayer and
                        then in the aqueous environment at the cytosolic or extracellular side of the membrane. This
                        mechanism, known as passive diffusion, does not involve membrane proteins. Lipid and
                        lipid-soluble (e.g. steroid) substances can also cross the bilayer.</div>

                        small ions H+, Na+, K+ and Cl–) are unable to dissolve in the hydrophobic interior of the
                        phospholipid bilayer. They require the help of specific transport proteins (<a
                           href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 1.4</span></a>) and channel proteins, which facilitate
                        the passage or facilitated diffusion of most biological molecules. Facilitated diffusion
                        requires carrier proteins, which can bind specific molecules to be transported, or channel
                        proteins, which form open gates through the membrane. Carrier proteins transport sugars, amino
                        acids and nucleosides. Channel proteins are ion channels involved in the rapid transport of ions
                        (faster transport than that mediated by carrier proteins), are highly selective of molecular

                        lysosomal function, namely soluble acid hydrolases and integral lysosomal membrane proteins.
                        Each of the 60 or more known acid hydrolases (including proteases, lipases, carbohydrases,
                        esterases and nucleases) degrades a specific substrate. There are about 25 lysosomal membrane
                        proteins participating in the acidification of the lysosomal lumen, protein import from the
                        cytosol, membrane fusion and transport of degradation products to the cytoplasm. Material that
                        has been hydrolysed within secondary lysosomes may be completely degraded to soluble products,
                        e.g. amino acids, which are recycled through metabolic pathways. However, degradation is usually
                        incomplete and some debris remains. A debris-laden vesicle is called a residual body or tertiary
                        lysosome (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 1.6B</a>), and may be passed to the cell surface, where it
                        is ejected by exocytosis; alternatively, it may persist inside the cell as an inert residual
                        body. Considerable numbers of residual bodies can accumulate in long-lived cells, often fusing
                        to form larger dense vacuoles with complex lamellar inclusions. As their contents are often
                        darkly pigmented, this may change the colour of the tissue; e.g. in neurones, the end-product of
                        lysosomal digestion, lipofuscin (neuromelanin or senility pigment), gives ageing brains a
                        brownish-yellow coloration. Lysosomal enzymes may also be secreted – often as part of a process
                        to alter the extracellular matrix, as in osteoclast-mediated erosion during bone resorption. For

                           unaffected donor (<a href="#f0045"><span class="bold">Fig. 1.8</span></a>). This procedure
                           can be performed after in vitro fertilization using sperm from the intended father. Soon
                           after fertilization, the haploid maternal and paternal nuclei are assembled as a pronucleus.
                           Because it is difficult to distinguish between male and female pronuclei, pronuclear transfer
                           (PNT) involves transplantation of both the maternal and paternal pronuclei, clearly
                           visualized by light microscopy. mtDNA resides within mitochondria, separately from the genes
                           housed in each cell nucleus. Since mitochondria are inherited only through the maternal
                           germline, mutated mitochondria are thus replaced with normal mitochondria from enucleated
                           oocytes provided by the unaffected donor. An alternative procedure involves transfer of the
                           nuclear genetic material from the affected female (maternal spindle transfer, MST) into an
                           enucleated donor egg with normal mitochondria, prior to fertilization.</div>

                     and integrate their functions, through a variety of processes known collectively as cell
                     signalling, in which a signalling molecule produced by one cell is detected by another, almost
                     always by means of a specific receptor protein molecule. The recipient cell transduces the signal,
                     which it most often detects at the plasma membrane, into intracellular chemical messages that
                     change cell behaviour.</div>
                  <div class="text" id="p5058">The signal may act over a long distance, e.g. endocrine signalling
                     through the release of hormones into the blood stream, or neuronal synaptic signalling via
                     electrical impulse transmission along axons and subsequent release of chemical transmitters of the
                     signal at synapses or neuromuscular junctions. A specialized variation of endocrine signalling
                     (neurocrine or neuroendocrine signalling) occurs when neurones or paraneurones (e.g. chromaffin
                     cells of the suprarenal medulla) secrete a hormone into interstitial fluid and the blood stream.
                     Alternatively, signalling may occur at short range through a paracrine mechanism, in which cells of
                     one type release molecules into the interstitial fluid of the local environment, to be detected by
                     nearby cells of a different type that express the specific receptor protein.</div>
                  <div class="text" id="p5059">Neurocrine cell signalling uses chemical messengers found also in the
                     central nervous system, which may act in a paracrine manner via interstitial fluid or reach more
                     distant target tissues via the blood stream. Cells may generate and respond to the same signal.
                     This is autocrine signalling, a phenomenon that reinforces the coordinated activities of a group of
                     like cells, which respond together to a high concentration of a local signalling molecule. The most
                     extreme form of short-distance signalling is contact-dependent (juxtacrine) signalling, where one
                     cell responds to transmembrane proteins of an adjacent cell that bind to surface receptors in the
                     responding cell membrane. Contact-dependent signalling also includes cellular responses to
                     integrins on the cell surface binding to elements of the extracellular matrix. Juxtacrine
                     signalling is important during development and in immune responses. These different types of

                     <div class="textfl" id="p5060">The majority of signalling molecules (ligands) are hydrophilic and
                        so cannot cross the plasma membrane of a recipient cell to effect changes inside the cell unless
                        they first bind to a plasma membrane receptor protein. Ligands are mainly proteins (usually
                        glycoproteins), polypeptides or highly charged biogenic amines. They include classic peptide
                        hormones of the endocrine system; cytokines, which are mainly of haemopoietic cell origin and
                        involved in inflammatory responses and tissue remodelling (e.g. the interferons, interleukins,
                        tumour necrosis factor, leukaemia inhibitory factor); and polypeptide growth factors (e.g. the
                        epidermal growth factor superfamily, nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, the
                        fibroblast growth factor family, transforming growth factor beta and the insulin-like growth
                        factors). Polypeptide growth factors are multifunctional molecules with more widespread actions
                        and cellular sources than their names suggest. They and their receptors are commonly mutated or
                        aberrantly expressed in certain cancers. The cancer-causing gene variant is termed a
                        transforming oncogene and the normal (wild-type) version of the gene is a cellular oncogene or
                        proto-oncogene. The activated receptor acts as a transducer to generate intracellular signals,
                        which are either small diffusible second messengers (e.g. calcium, cyclic adenosine
                        monophosphate or the plasma membrane lipid-soluble diacylglycerol), or larger protein complexes
                        that amplify and relay the signal to target control systems.</div>
                     <div class="text" id="p5061">Some signals are hydrophobic and able to cross the plasma membrane
                        freely. Classic examples are the steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, retinoids and vitamin D.
                        Steroids, for instance, enter cells non-selectively, but elicit a specific response only in
                        those target cells that express specific cytoplasmic or nuclear receptors. Light stimuli also
                        cross the plasma membranes of photoreceptor cells and interact intracellularly, at least in rod
                        cells, with membrane-bound photosensitive receptor proteins. Hydrophobic ligands are transported
                        in the blood stream or interstitial fluids, generally bound to carrier proteins, and they often
                        have a longer half-life and longer-lasting effects on their targets than do water-soluble
                        ligands.</div>

                        nitric oxide signalling is smooth muscle, which relaxes in response. Nitric oxide is released
                        from vascular endothelium as a result of the action of autonomic nerves that supply the vessel
                        wall, causing local relaxation of smooth muscle and consequent dilation of the vessel. This

                        <div class="textfl" id="p5063">There are some 20 different families of receptor proteins, each
                           with several isoforms responding to different ligands. The great majority of these receptors
                           are transmembrane proteins. Members of each family share structural features that indicate
                           either shared ligand-binding characteristics in the extracellular domain or shared signal
                           transduction properties in the cytoplasmic domain, or both. There is little relationship
                           either between the nature of a ligand and the family of receptor proteins to which it binds
                           and activates, or the signal transduction strategies by which an intracellular response is
                           achieved. The same ligand may activate fundamentally different types of receptor in different
                           cell types.</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p5064">Cell surface receptor proteins are generally grouped according to
                           their linkage to one of three intracellular systems: ion channel-linked receptors; G-protein
                           coupled receptors; or receptors that link to enzyme systems. Other receptors do not fit
                           neatly into any of these categories. All the known G-protein-coupled receptors belong to a
                           structural group of proteins that pass through the membrane seven times in a series of
                           serpentine loops: these receptors are thus known as seven-pass transmembrane receptors or,
                           because the transmembrane regions are formed from α-helical domains, as seven-helix
                           receptors. The best known of this large group of phylogenetically ancient receptors are the
                           odorant-binding proteins of the olfactory system; the light-sensitive receptor protein,
                           rhodopsin; and many of the receptors for clinically useful drugs. A comprehensive list of

                        to transmit and amplify a signal upon ligand binding. A signalling pathway can activate a series
                        of intracellular targets located downstream of the receptor, in particular the activity of
                        intracellular proteins, or, like neurotransmitter receptors, control the flow of water
                        (aquaporins) and electrolytes across ligand-gated ion channels located on the plasma membrane.
                        An amplified signal can be propagated to the nucleus to regulate gene expression in response to
                        an external cell stimulus.</div>
                     <div class="text" id="p5066">The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway is a major
                        intracellular signalling pathway. For example, there is an increase in the intracellular
                        concentration of cAMP when adrenaline (epinephrine) binds to its receptor. Adrenaline breaks
                        down glycogen into glucose before muscle contraction. cAMP is formed from ATP by the action of
                        the enzyme adenylyl cyclase and degraded to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) by the enzyme cAMP
                        phosphodiesterase. This mechanism led to the concept of a first messenger (adrenaline) mediating
                        a cell-signalling effect by a second messenger, cAMP.</div>
                     <div class="text" id="p5067">The adrenaline receptor is linked to adenylyl cyclase by G protein,
                        which stimulates cyclase activity upon adrenaline binding. In the adrenaline-dependent
                        regulation of glycogen metabolism, the intracellular signalling effects of cAMP are mediated by
                        the enzyme cAMP-dependent protein kinase (or protein kinase A). In its inactive form, protein
                        kinase A is a tetramer composed of two regulatory subunits (to which cAMP binds) and two
                        catalytic subunits. Binding of cAMP results in the dissociation of the catalytic subunits. Free

                     <h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0170">Myosins, the motor proteins</h5>
                     <div class="textfl" id="p5097">The myosin family of microfilaments is often classified within a
                        distinct category of motor proteins. Myosin proteins have a globular head region consisting of a
                        heavy and a light chain. The heavy chain bears an α-helical tail of varying length. The head has
                        an ATPase activity and can bind to and move along actin filaments – the basis for myosin
                        function as a motor protein. The best-known class is myosin II, which occurs in muscle and in
                        many non-muscle cells. Its molecules have two heads and two tails, intertwined to form a long
                        rod. The rods can bind to each other to form long, thick filaments, as seen in striated and
                        smooth muscle fibres and myoepithelial cells. Myosin II molecules can also assemble into smaller
                        groups, especially dimers, which can cross-link individual actin microfilaments in stress fibres
                        and other F-actin arrays. The ATP-dependent sliding of myosin on actin forms the basis for
                        muscle contraction and the extension of microfilament bundles, as seen in cellular motility or
                        in the contraction of the ring of actin and myosin around the cleavage furrow of dividing cells.
                        There are a number of known subtypes of myosin II; they assemble in different ways and have
                        different dynamic properties. In skeletal muscle the myosin molecules form bipolar filaments
                        15<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span
                              style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>nm thick. Because these filaments have a symmetric
                        antiparallel arrangement of subunits, the midpoint is bare of head regions. In smooth muscle the
                        molecules form thicker, flattened bundles and are orientated in random directions on either face
                        of the bundle. These arrangements have important consequences for the contractile force
                        characteristics of the different types of muscle cell.</div>
                     <div class="text" id="p5098">Related molecules include the myosin I subfamily of single-headed
                        molecules with tails of varying length. Functions of myosin I include the movements of membranes
                        in endocytosis, filopodial formation in neuronal growth cones, actin–actin sliding and
                        attachment of actin to membranes as seen in microvilli. As indicated above, molecular motors of
                        the myosin V family are implicated in the movements of cargoes on actin filaments. So, for
                        example, myosin Va transports vesicles along F-actin tracks in a similar manner to kinesin and
                        cytoplasmic dynein-related cargo transport along microtubules. Each class of motor protein has
                        different properties, but during cargo trafficking they often function together in a coordinated
                        fashion. (See <a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">Hammer and

                        straight rows of alternating α- and β-tubulins, forming protofilaments (<a href="#f0070"><span
                              class="bold">Fig. 1.13B</span></a>). Typically, 13 protofilaments (the number can vary
                        between 11 and 16) associate in a ring to form the wall of a hollow cylindrical microtubule (<a
                           href="#f0075"><span class="bold">Fig. 1.14C</span></a>). Each longitudinal row is slightly
                        out of alignment with its neighbour, so that a spiral pattern of alternating α and β subunits
                        appears when the microtubule is viewed from the side. There is a dynamic equilibrium between the
                        dimers and assembled microtubules: dimeric asymmetry creates polarity (α-tubulins are all
                        orientated towards the minus end, β-tubulins towards the plus end). Tubulin is added
                        preferentially to the plus end; the minus end is relatively slow-growing. Microtubules
                        frequently grow and shrink at a rapid and constant rate, a phenomenon known as dynamic
                        instability, in which growing tubules can undergo a ‘catastrophe’, abruptly shifting from net
                        growth to rapid shrinkage. The primary determinant of whether microtubules grow or shrink is the
                        rate of GTP hydrolysis. Tubulins are GTP-binding proteins; microtubule growth is accompanied by
                        hydrolysis of GTP, which may regulate the dynamic behaviour of the tubules. Microtubule growth
                        is initiated at specific sites, the microtubule-organizing centres, of which the best known are
                        centrosomes (from which most cellular microtubules polymerize) and the centriole-derived basal
                        bodies (from which cilia grow). Microtubule-organizing centres include a specialized tubulin
                        isoform known as γ-tubulin that is essential for the nucleation of microtubule growth.</div>
                     <div class="text" id="p5102">Various drugs (e.g. colcemid, vinblastine, griseofulvin, nocodazole)
                        cause microtubule depolymerization by binding the soluble tubulin dimers and so shifting the
                        equilibrium towards the unpolymerized state. Microtubule disassembly causes a wide variety of
                        effects, including the inhibition of cell division by disruption of the mitotic spindle.
                        Conversely, the drug paclitaxel (taxol) is a microtubule depolymerization inhibitor because it
                        stabilizes microtubules and promotes abnormal microtubule assembly. Although this can cause a
                        peripheral neuropathy, paclitaxel is widely used as an effective chemotherapeutic agent in the
                        treatment of breast and ovarian cancer.</div>

                        <div class="textfl" id="p5103">Various proteins that can bind to assembled tubulins may be
                           concerned with structural properties or associated with motility. One important class of
                           microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) consists of proteins that associate with the plus ends
                           of microtubules. They regulate the dynamic instability of microtubules as well as
                           interactions with other cellular substructures. Structural MAPs form cross-bridges between
                           adjacent microtubules or between microtubules and other structures such as intermediate
                           filaments, mitochondria and the plasma membrane. Microtubule-associated proteins found in
                           neurones include: MAPs 1A and 1B, which are present in neuronal dendrites and axons; MAPs 2A
                           and 2B, found chiefly in dendrites; and tau, found only in axons. MAP 4 is the major
                           microtubule-associated protein in many other cell types. Structural microtubule-associated
                           proteins are implicated in microtubule formation, maintenance and disassembly, and are
                           therefore of considerable significance in cell morphogenesis, mitotic division, and the
                           maintenance and modulation of cell shape.</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p5104">Transport-associated microtubule-associated proteins are found in
                           situations in which movement occurs over the surfaces of microtubules, e.g. cargo transport,
                           bending of cilia and flagella, and some movements of mitotic spindles. They include a large
                           family of motor proteins, the best known of which are the dyneins and kinesins. Another
                           protein, dynamin, is involved in endocytosis. The kinetochore proteins assemble at the
                           chromosomal centromere during mitosis and meiosis. They attach (and thus fasten chromosomes)
                           to spindle microtubules; some of the kinetochore proteins are responsible for chromosomal
                           movements in mitotic and meiotic anaphase.</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p5105">All of these microtubule-associated proteins bind to microtubules
                           and either actively slide along their surfaces or promote microtubule assembly or
                           disassembly. Kinesins and dyneins can simultaneously attach to membranes such as transport
                           vesicles and convey them along microtubules for considerable distances, thus enabling
                           selective targeting of materials within the cell. Such movements occur in both directions
                           along microtubules. Kinesin-dependent motion is usually towards the plus ends of
                           microtubules, e.g. from the cell body towards the axon terminals in neurones, and away from
                           the centrosome in other cells. Conversely, dynein-related movements are in the opposite
                           direction, i.e. to the minus ends of microtubules. The transport of cargoes along
                           microtubules is the means by which neurotransmitters are delivered along axons within
                           synaptic vesicle precursors towards neuronal synapses (anterograde axonal transport,
                           utilizing kinesins) and membrane-bound vesicles are returned for recycling to the neuronal
                           soma (retrograde axonal transport, utilizing dyneins).</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p5106">Dyneins also form the arms of peripheral microtubules in cilia and

                           cause the axonemal array of microtubules to bend, generating ciliary and flagellar beating
                           movements. Kinesins form a large and diverse family of related microtubule-stimulated
                           ATPases. Some kinesins are motors that move cargo and others cause microtubule disassembly,
                           whilst still others cross-link mitotic spindle microtubules to push the two centriolar poles

                        consist of filamentous monomers lacking enzymatic activity. Intermediate filament proteins

                        acids flanked by head and tail non-α-helical domains of variable size, form a parallel dimer
                        through their central α-helical rod domains coiled around each other. The variability of
                        intermediate filament protein subunits resides in the length and amino-acid sequence of the head
                        and tail domains, thought to be involved in regulating the interaction of intermediate filaments

                        present in large numbers, either to provide structural strength where it is needed (see <a

                        extending from cage-like perinuclear arrangements to the cell surface. Intermediate filaments of
                        different molecular classes are characteristic of particular tissues or states of maturity and
                        are therefore important indicators of the origins of cells or degrees of differentiation, as
                        well as being of considerable value in histopathology.</div>
                     <div class="text" id="p5114">Intermediate filament proteins have been classified into five distinct
                        types on the basis of their primary structure and tissue-specific expression. Of the different
                        classes of intermediate filaments, keratin (cytokeratin) proteins are found in epithelia, where
                        keratin filaments are always composed of equal ratios of type I (acidic) and type II (basic to
                        neutral) keratins to form heteropolymers. About 20 types of each of the acidic and basic/neutral
                        keratin proteins are known. For further reading on keratins in normal and diseased epithelia,
                        see <a href="#bib52" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_52">Pan et al (2012)</a>.
                        Within the epidermis, expression of keratin heteropolymers changes as keratinocytes mature
                        during their transition from basal to superficial layers. Genetic abnormalities of keratins are
                        known to affect the mechanical stability of epithelia. For example, the disease epidermolysis
                        bullosa simplex is caused by lysis of epidermal basal cells and blistering of the skin after
                        mechanical trauma. Defects in genes encoding keratins 5 and 14 produce cytoskeletal instability
                        leading to cellular fragility in the basal cells of the epidermis. When keratins 1 and 10 are
                        affected, cells in the spinous (prickle) cell layer of the epidermis lyse, and this produces the
                        intraepidermal blistering of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. See <a href="#bib46"

                        glial fibrillary acidic protein and peripherin, form homopolymer intermediate filaments.
                        Vimentin is expressed in mesenchyme-derived cells of connective tissue and some ectodermal cells
                        during early development; desmins in muscle cells; glial fibrillary acidic protein in glial
                        cells; and peripherin in peripheral axons. Type IV intermediate filaments include
                        neurofilaments, nestin, syncoilin and α-internexin. Neurofilaments are a major cytoskeletal
                        element in neurones, particularly in axons (see <a href="#f0075">Fig. 1.14C</a>), where they are
                        the dominant protein. Neurofilaments (NF) are heteropolymers of low (NF–L), medium (NF–M) and
                        high (NF–H) molecular weight (the NF–L form is always present in combination with either NF–M or
                        NF–H forms). Abnormal accumulations of neurofilaments (neurofibrillary tangles) are
                        characteristic features of a number of neuropathological conditions. Nestin resembles a
                        neurofilament protein, which forms intermediate filaments in neurectodermal stem cells in
                        particular. The type V intermediate filament group includes the nuclear lamins A, lamin B1 and
                        lamin B2 lining the inner surface of the nuclear envelope of all nucleated cells. Lamin C is a
                        splice variant of lamin A. Lamins provide a mechanical framework for the nucleus and act as
                        attachment sites for a number of proteins that organize chromatin at the periphery of the
                        nucleus. They are unusual in that they form an irregular anastomosing network of filaments

                        nuclear envelope during interphase. At the end of mitotic and meiotic prophase (see below), the
                        lamin filaments disassemble by phosphorylation, causing the nuclear membranes to vesiculate and
                        disperse into the endoplasmic reticulum. During the final stages of mitosis (telophase),
                        proteins of the nuclear periphery, including lamins, associate with the surface of the
                        chromosomes, providing docking sites for membrane vesicles. Fusion of these vesicles

                        as chromatin. The protein constituents of chromatin are the histones and the non-histone
                        proteins. Non-histone proteins are an extremely heterogeneous group that includes structural
                        proteins, DNA and RNA polymerases, and gene regulatory proteins. Histones are the most abundant
                        group of proteins in chromatin, primarily responsible for the packaging of chromosomal DNA into
                        its primary level of organization, the nucleosome. There are four core histone proteins – H2A,
                        H2B, H3 and H4 – which vary in amino acid sequence and post-translational modifications <span

                        equal ratios to form a compact octameric nucleosome core. A fifth histone, H1, is involved in
                        further compaction of the chromatin (<a href="#f0095"><span class="bold">Fig. 1.18</span></a>).
                        The DNA molecule (one per chromosome) winds twice around each nucleosome core, taking up 145–147

                        one of the linker regions constitute the nucleosome proper, which is typically about 200
                        nucleotide pairs in length. However, chromatin rarely exists in this simple form and is usually
                        packaged further into a 30 nm thick fibre, involving a single H1 histone per nucleosome, which
                        interacts with both DNA and protein to impose a higher order of nucleosome packing. Usually,

                        mainly around the periphery of the nucleus, except over the nuclear pores (see <a
                           href="#f0090">Fig. 1.17A</a>), and adjacent to the nucleolus (see <a href="#f0015">Fig.
                           1.2</a>). It is a relatively compacted form of chromatin in which the histone proteins carry
                        a specific set of post-translational modifications, including methylation at characteristic
                        residues. This facilitates the binding of specific heterochromatin-associated proteins.
                        Heterochromatin includes non-coding regions of DNA, such as centromeric regions, which are known
                        as constitutive heterochromatin. DNA becomes transcriptionally inactive in some cells as they
                        differentiate during development or cell maturation, and contributes to heterochromatin; it is
                        known as facultative heterochromatin. The inactive X chromosome in females is an example of
                        facultative heterochromatin and can be identified in the light microscope as the deeply staining

                        microtubules of the spindle attach. Another region, the telomere, defines the end of each
                        chromosomal DNA molecule. Telomeres consist of hundreds of repeats of the nucleotide sequence
                        (TTAGGG)<sub>n</sub>. The very ends of the chromosomes cannot be replicated by the same DNA
                        polymerase as the rest of the chromosome, and are maintained by a specific enzyme called
                        telomerase, which contains an RNA subunit acting as the template for lengthening the TTAGGG
                        repeats. See <a href="#bib51" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_51">Nandakumar and
                           Cech (2013)</a> for further reading on the recruitment of telomerase to telomeres. Thus
                        telomerase is a specialized type of polymerase known as a reverse transcriptase that turns
                        sequences in RNA back into DNA. The number of tandem repeats of the telomeric DNA sequence
                        varies. The telomere appears to shorten with successive cell divisions because telomerase
                        activity reduces or is absent in differentiated cells with a finite lifespan. In mammals,
                        telomerase is active in the germ-cell lineage and in stem cells, but its expression in somatic
                        cells may lead to or prompt cancer. A lack of telomere maintenance determines the shrinking of
                        telomeres in proliferating cells to the point when cells stop dividing, a condition known as
                        replicative senescence. See <a href="#bib62" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"

                        <div class="textfl" id="p6014">A number of genetic abnormalities can be directly related to the
                           chromosomal pattern. The characterization or karyotyping of chromosome number and structure
                           is therefore of considerable diagnostic importance. The identifying features of individual
                           chromosomes are most easily seen during metaphase, although prophase chromosomes can be used
                           for more detailed analyses.</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p5128">Lymphocytes separated from blood samples, or cells taken from other
                           tissues, are used as a source of chromosomes. Diagnosis of fetal chromosome patterns is
                           generally carried out on samples of amniotic fluid containing fetal cells aspirated from the
                           uterus by amniocentesis, or on a small piece of chorionic villus tissue removed from the
                           placenta. Whatever their origin, the cells are cultured <span class="italic">in vitro</span>
                           and stimulated to divide by treatment with agents that stimulate cell division. Mitosis is
                           interrupted at metaphase with spindle inhibitors. The chromosomes are dispersed by first
                           causing the cells to swell in a hypotonic solution, then the cells are gently fixed and
                           mechanically ruptured on a slide to spread the chromosomes. They are subsequently stained in
                           various ways to allow the identification of individual chromosomes by size, shape and
                           distribution of stain (<a href="#f0100"><span class="bold">Fig. 1.19</span></a>). General
                           techniques show the obvious landmarks, e.g. lengths of arms and positions of constrictions.
                           Banding techniques demonstrate differential staining patterns, characteristic for each
                           chromosome type. Fluorescence staining with quinacrine mustard and related compounds produces
                           Q bands, and Giemsa staining (after treatment that partially denatures the chromatin) gives G
                           bands (see <a href="#f0100">Fig. 1.19A</a>). Other less widely used methods include: reverse
                           Giemsa staining, in which the light and dark areas are reversed (R bands); the staining of
                           constitutive heterochromatin with silver salts (C-banding); and T-banding to stain the ends
                           (telomeres) of chromosomes. Collectively, these methods permit the classification of
                           chromosomes into numbered autosomal pairs in order of decreasing size, from 1 to 22, plus the
                           sex chromosomes.</div>

                     <div class="textfl" id="p5133">Nucleoli are a prominent feature of an interphase nucleus (see <a
                           href="#f0015">Fig. 1.2</a>). They are the site of most of the synthesis of ribosomal RNA
                        (rRNA) and assembly of ribosome subunits. Nucleoli organize at the end of mitosis and consist of
                        repeated clusters of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes and processing molecules responsible for
                        producing ribosome subunits. The initial step of the assembly of a ribosome subunit starts with
                        the transcription of rDNA genes by RNA polymerase I. The rDNA genes, arranged in tandem repeats
                        called nucleolar organizing regions (NORs), are located on acrocentric chromosomes. There are
                        five pairs of acrocentric chromosomes in humans. The initial 47S rRNA precursor transcript is
                        cleaved to form the mature 28S, 18S and 5.8S rRNAs, assembled with the 5S rRNA (synthesized by
                        RNA polymerase III outside the nucleolus) and coupled to small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins and
                        other non-ribosomal proteins to form 60S (containing 28S rRNA, 5.8S rRNA and 5S rRNA) and 40S
                        (containing 18S rRNA) preribosome subunits. These are then exported to the cytoplasm across
                        nuclear pores as mature ribosome subunits. About 726 human nucleolar proteins have been
                        identified by protein purification and mass spectrometry. For further reading on nucleolar

                        specific chromosome, and becomes functional during the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle. An
                        adequate pool of ribosome subunits during cell growth and cell division requires steady
                        nucleolar activity to support protein synthesis. Several DNA helicases, a conserved group of
                        enzymes that unwind DNA, accumulate in the nucleolus under specific conditions such as Bloom's
                        syndrome (an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by growth deficiency, immunodeficiency
                        and a predisposition to cancer) and Werner's syndrome (an autosomal recessive condition
                        characterized by the early appearance of various age-related diseases).</div>

            <div class="textfl" id="p5136">During prenatal development, most cells undergo repeated division (<span
                  class="bold">Video 1.1</span>) as the body grows in size and complexity. As cells mature, they
               differentiate structurally and functionally. Some cells, such as neurones, lose the ability to divide.
               Others may persist throughout the lifetime of the individual as replication-competent stem cells, e.g.
               cells in the haemopoietic tissue of bone marrow. Many stem cells divide infrequently, but give rise to
               daughter cells that undergo repeated cycles of mitotic division as transit (or transient) amplifying
               cells. Their divisions may occur in rapid succession, as in cell lineages with a short lifespan and
               similarly fast turnover and replacement time. Transit amplifying cells are all destined to differentiate
               and ultimately to die and be replaced, unlike the population of parental stem cells, which self-renews.
            </div>
            <div class="text" id="p5137">Patterns and rates of cell division within tissues vary considerably. In many
               epithelia, such as the crypts between intestinal villi, the replacement of damaged or ageing cells by
               division of stem cells can be rapid. Rates of cell division may also vary according to demand, as occurs
               in the healing of wounded skin, in which cell proliferation increases to a peak and then returns to the
               normal replacement level. The rate of cell division is tightly coupled to the demand for growth and
               replacement. Where this coupling is faulty, tissues either fail to grow or replace their cells, or they
               can overgrow, producing neoplasms.</div>
            <div class="text" id="p5138">The cell cycle is an ordered sequence of events, culminating in cell growth and
               division to produce two daughter cells. It generally lasts a minimum of 12 hours, but in most adult
               tissues can be considerably longer, and is divided into four distinct phases, which are known as
               G<sub>1</sub> (for gap 1), S (for DNA synthesis), G<sub>2</sub> (for gap 2) and M (for mitosis). The
               combination of G<sub>1</sub>, S and G<sub>2</sub> phases is known as interphase. M is the mitotic phase,
               which is further divided into four phases (see below). G<sub>1</sub> is the period when cells respond to
               growth factors directing the cell to initiate another cycle; once made, this decision is irreversible. It
               is also the phase in which most of the molecular machinery required to complete another cell cycle is
               generated. Centrosomes duplicate during S phase in preparation for mitosis. Cells that retain the
               capacity for proliferation, but which are no longer dividing, have entered a phase called G<sub>0</sub>
               and are described as quiescent even though they may be quite active physiologically. Growth factors can
               stimulate quiescent cells to leave G<sub>0</sub> and re-enter the cell cycle, whereas the proteins
               encoded by certain tumour suppressor genes (e.g. the gene mutated in retinoblastoma, <span
                  class="italic">Rb</span>) block the cycle in G<sub>1</sub>. DNA synthesis (replication of the genome)
               occurs during S phase, at the end of which the DNA content of the cell has doubled. During G<sub>2</sub>,
               the cell prepares for division; this period ends with the onset of chromosome condensation and breakdown
               of the nuclear envelope. The times taken for S, G<sub>2</sub> and M are similar for most cell types, and
               occupy 6–8, 2–4 and 1–2 hours respectively. In contrast, the duration of G<sub>1</sub> shows considerable
               variation, sometimes ranging from less than 2 hours in rapidly dividing cells to more than 100 hours,
               within the same tissue.</div>
            <div class="text" id="p5139">The passage of a cell through the cell cycle is controlled by proteins in the
               cytoplasm: cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks; <a href="#f0110"><span class="bold">Fig.
                     1.21</span></a>). Cyclins include G<sub>1</sub> cyclins (D cyclins), S-phase cyclins (cyclins E and
               A) and mitotic cyclins (B cyclins). Cdks, protein kinases, which are activated by binding of a cyclin
               subunit, include G<sub>1</sub> Cdk (Cdk4), an S-phase Cdk (Cdk2) and an M-phase Cdk (Cdk1). Cell cycle
               progression is driven in part by changes in the activity of Cdks. Each cell cycle stage is characterized
               by the activity of one or more Cdk–cyclin pairs. Transitions between cell cycle stages are triggered by
               highly specific proteolysis by the 26S proteasome of the cyclins and other key components. The targets
               for proteolysis are marked for destruction by E3 ubiquitin ligases, which decorate them with polymers of
               the small protein ubiquitin, a sign for recognition by the 26S proteasome.</div>

            <div class="text" id="p5140">To give one example, the transition from G<sub>2</sub> to mitosis is driven by
               activation of Cdk1 by its partners, the A- and B-type cyclins; the characteristic changes in cellular
               structure that occur as cells enter mitosis are largely driven by phosphorylation of proteins by active
               Cdk1-cyclin A and Cdk1-cyclin B. Cells exit from mitosis when an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the anaphase
               promoting complex, also called cyclosome (APC/C), marks the cyclins for destruction. In addition, APC/C
               prompts <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="20" id="pagebreak_20" /><a

               sister chromatids to separate.</div>
            <div class="text" id="p5141">There are important checkpoints in the cell cycle (see <a href="#f0110">Fig.
                  1.21</a>). Checkpoint 1 requires G<sub>1</sub> cyclins to bind to their corresponding Cdks to signal
               the cell to prepare for DNA synthesis. S-phase promoting factor (SPF; cyclin A bound to Cdk2) enters the
               nucleus to stimulate DNA synthesis. Checkpoint 2 requires M-phase promoting factor (mitotic cyclin B
               bound to M-phase Cdk1) to trigger the assembly of the mitotic spindle, breakdown of the nuclear envelope,
               arrest of gene transcription and condensation of chromosomes. During metaphase of mitosis, M-phase
               promoting factor activates APC/C, which determines the breakdown of cohesins, the protein complex holding
               sister chromatids together. Then, at anaphase, separated chromatids move to the opposite poles of the
               spindle. Finally, B cyclins are destroyed following their attachment to ubiquitin, targeting them for
               destruction by the 26S proteasome. As G<sub>1</sub> starts, cyclins D, bound to Cdk4, start preparation
               for a new cell cycle.</div>
            <div class="text" id="p5142">Quality control checkpoint 2 operates to delay cell-cycle progression when DNA
               has been damaged by radiation or chemical mutagens. Cells with checkpoint defects, such as loss of the
               protein p53, which is a major negative control element in the division cycle of all cells, are commonly
               associated with the development of malignancy. An example is Li Fraumeni syndrome, where a defective
               <span class="italic">p53</span> gene leads to a high frequency of cancer in affected individuals. In
               cells, p53 protein binds DNA and stimulates another gene to produce p21 protein, which interacts with
               Cdk2 to prevent S-phase promoting activity. When mutant p53 can no longer bind DNA to stimulate
               production of p21 to stop DNA synthesis, cells acquire oncogenic properties. The <span

                  <div class="textfl" id="p5143">Mitosis is the process that results in the distribution of identical
                     copies of the parent cell genome to the two daughter somatic cells. In meiosis, the divisions
                     immediately before the final production of gametes halve the number of chromosomes to the haploid
                     number, so that at fertilization the diploid number is restored. Moreover, meiosis includes a phase
                     in which exchange of genetic material occurs between homologous chromosomes. This allows a
                     rearrangement of genes to take place, which means that the daughter cells differ from the parental
                     cell in both their precise genetic sequence and their haploid state. Mitosis and meiosis are alike
                     in many respects, and differ principally in chromosomal behaviour during the early stages of cell
                     division. In meiosis, two divisions occur in succession, without an intervening S phase. Meiosis I
                     is distinct from mitosis, whereas meiosis II is more like mitosis.</div>

                        this amount is halved between the two daughter cells, so that DNA quantity and chromosome number
                        are diploid in both cells. The cellular changes that achieve this distribution are

                           bundles attached to the kinetochores shorten and move polewards. At the end of anaphase the
                           sister chromatids are grouped at either end of the cell, and both clusters are diploid in
                           number. An infolding of the cell equator begins, deepening during telophase as the cleavage

                           association of membranous vesicles with the surface of the chromosomes. Later, after the
                           vesicles have fused and the nuclear envelope is complete, the chromosomes decondense and the
                           nucleoli reform. At the same time, cytoplasmic division, which usually begins in early
                           anaphase, continues until the new cells separate, each with its derived nucleus. The spindle
                           remnant now disintegrates. While the cleavage furrow is active, a peripheral band or belt of
                           actin and myosin appears in the constricting zone; contraction of this band is responsible
                           for furrow formation.</div>

                           pass to the same pole, may sometimes occur. Of the two new cells, one will have more, and the
                           other fewer, chromosomes than the diploid number. Exposure to ionizing radiation promotes
                           non-disjunction and may, by chromosomal damage, inhibit mitosis altogether. A typical symptom
                           of radiation exposure is the failure of rapidly dividing epithelia to replace lost cells,
                           with consequent ulceration of the skin and mucous membranes. Mitosis can also be disrupted by
                           chemical agents, particularly vinblastine, paclitaxel (taxol) and their derivatives. These
                           compounds either disassemble spindle microtubules or interfere with their dynamics, so that

                                 pairing or synapsis, during which they become intimately associated with one another.
                                 Synapsis may begin near the telomeres at the inner surface of the nuclear membrane, and
                                 during this stage the telomeres often cluster to one side of the nucleus (a stage known

               different environments on either side. The cells they contain actively transfer macromolecules and ions
               between the two surfaces and are thus polarized in structure and function. Polarized cells, particularly
               in epithelia, are generally subdivided into domains that reflect the activities that occur within them.
               The free surface, e.g. facing the intestinal lumen or airway, is the apical surface: its adjacent
               cytoplasm is the apical cell domain, where the cell interfaces with a specific body compartment (or, in
               the case of the epidermis, with the outside world). The apical surface is therefore specialized to act as
               a barrier, restricting access of substances from this compartment to the rest of the body. Specific
               components are selectively absorbed from, or added to, the external compartment by the active processes
               of active transport and endocytosis inwardly or exocytosis and secretion outwardly, respectively. The

            <div class="text" id="p5164">The surface of the cell opposite to the apical surface is the basal surface;
               its associated cytoplasm is the basolateral cell domain. In a single-layered epithelium, this surface
               faces the basal lamina. The other cell surfaces are known as the lateral cell surfaces: the lateral and
               basal surfaces often perform similar functions and their shared cellular domain is termed the basolateral
               domain. Cells actively transport substances, such as digested nutrients from the intestinal lumen or
               endocrine secretions, across their basal (or basolateral) surfaces into the subjacent connective tissue
               matrix and the blood capillaries that run within it. Dissolved non-polar gases (oxygen and carbon
               dioxide) diffuse freely between the cell and the blood stream across the basolateral surface. Apical and
               basolateral surfaces are separated by a tight intercellular seal, the tight junction (occluding junction,
               zonula adherens), which prevents the passage of even small ions through the space between adjacent cells,
               and thus maintains the difference between environments on either side of the epithelium.</div>

                     <div class="textfl" id="p5166">Cilia and flagella are motile, hair-like projections of the cell
                        surface. They create currents in the surrounding fluid or movements of the cell to which they
                        are attached, or both. There are two categories of cilia: single non-motile primary cilia and
                        multiple motile cilia. Primary cilia are non-motile but can detect physical and biochemical
                        signals. Motile cilia are present in large numbers on the apical domains of the epithelia of the
                        upper respiratory tract and oviducts, and beat in a wave-like motion to generate fluid movement.
                        Cilia also occur, in modified form, at the dendritic endings of olfactory receptor cells,
                        vestibular hair cells (kinocilia), and the photoreceptor rods and cones of the retina. Flagella
                        have a primary function in cell locomotion. They are found on single cell eukaryotes and on
                        spermatozoa, which each possess a single flagellum 70<span

                        structure of a cilium is covered by plasma membrane. The core of a cilium is the axoneme, a
                        cylinder of nine microtubule doublets surrounding a central pair of single microtubules (see <a
                           href="#f0130">Fig. 1.25</a>). Ciliogenesis of primary and motile cilia involves distinct
                        steps. A centriole-derived basal body migrates to the apical cell domain and axonemal
                        microtubule doublets emerge from its distal region (the transition zone). The continued
                        elongation of the cilium requires the import and intraciliary transport of tubulin dimers to the
                        distal tip by bidirectional motor-driven proteins of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex.
                        The constant length of cilia is maintained by a steady-state balance between tubulin turnover
                        and the addition of new tubulin dimers at the ciliary tip.</div>

                              microtubule doublets (see text); the basal body is structurally similar to a centriole,
                              but with microtubule triplets. The cilium is formed and maintained by the transport of
                              tubulins along the axoneme mediated by proteins of the intraflagellar transport (IFT)
                              system. IFT trafficking from the base of the cilium to the tip (anterograde transport; to
                              the microtubule plus end) is mediated by kinesin-2 motor proteins mobilizing IFT protein
                              complexes. Cytoplasmic dynein-2 motor proteins participate in retrograde transport (to the
                              microtubule minus end; base of the cilium). IFT proteins form a platform for transporting
                              cargo between the base and tip of the cilium. Proteins of the Hedgehog signalling pathway
                              participate in intraciliary and intraflagellar transport (not shown). Disruption of the
                              kinesin-2 motor or IFT proteins blocks cilia formation. Basal body proteins influence

                              with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). BBSome proteins, bound to ciliary proteins, facilitate
                              their crossing through the distal appendage. All motile and non-motile cilia extend from a

                        microtubule of the axoneme in the shaft of a cilium or flagellum. They include radial spokes

                        an inner sheath (see <a href="#f0130">Fig. 1.25</a>). The outer doublet microtubules bear two

                        13 protofilaments), that point towards the incomplete B subfibre of the adjacent doublet
                        (consisting of 10–11 protofilaments). Adjacent doublets are also linked by thin nexin filaments.

                     <div class="text" id="p5169">In motile cilia, arrays of dynein arms with ATPase activity cause
                        outer microtubule doublets to move past one another, resulting in a large-scale bending motion:
                        microtubules do not change in length. Movements of cilia and flagella are broadly similar. In
                        addition to the axoneme, spermatozoan flagella have outer dense fibres and a fibrous sheath
                        surrounding the axoneme. Flagella move by rapid undulation, passing from the attached to the
                        free end. There is an additional helical component to this motion in human spermatozoa. In
                        cilia, the beating is planar but asymmetric. In the effective stroke, the cilium remains stiff
                        except at its base, where it bends to produce an oar-like stroke. During the recovery stroke
                        that follows, the bend passes from base to tip, returning the cilium to its initial position for
                        the next cycle. The activity of groups of cilia is usually coordinated so that the bending of
                        one is rapidly followed by the bending of the next and so on, resulting in long travelling waves
                        of metachronal synchrony that pass over the tissue surface in the same direction as the
                        effective stroke. Ciliary motion is important in clearing mucus from airways, moving eggs along
                        oviducts, and circulating cerebrospinal fluid in brain ventricles. In the node of the developing
                        embryo, cilium-driven flow is essential for determining left–right visceral asymmetry
                        (developing patterning). Cilia also have a sensory function, determined by the presence of
                        receptor and channel proteins on the ciliary membrane, thus primary cilia in the collecting
                        ducts of the uriniferous tubule sense the flow of urine and also modulate duct morphogenesis.
                        Cilia are essential for signalling through the Hedgehog pathway, a mechanism involved in
                        organizing the body plan, organogenesis and tumorigenesis in vertebrates. For additional reading

                  <div class="textfl" id="p5180">The basolateral region of the plasma membrane of epithelial cells
                     establishes junctions with adjacent cells and with structural components of the extracellular
                     matrix. Intercellular junctions are resilient and dynamic, and prevent epithelial tissues from
                     dissociating into their component cells. In adults, the epidermis withstands imposed deformations
                     because of the interplay of two components of intercellular junctions, the junctional cytoskeleton
                     and cell adhesion molecules (<a href="#f0140"><span class="bold">Fig. 1.27</span></a>). The
                     establishment and maintenance of cell polarity in an epithelial layer depends on two
                     circumferential apical belts, the tight junctions and the zonulae adherentes, running in parallel
                     to each other and associated with F-actin. These two belts control epithelial permeability and
                     determine epithelial cell polarity. The apical cell domain resides above the belts; the basolateral
                     cell domain resides below the belts. Desmosomes (maculae adherentes) are a third class of spot-like
                     intercellular adhesion. In contrast to tight junctions and the zonulae adherentes, desmosomes do
                     not form belts and link instead to intermediate filaments. The hemidesmosome, anchoring epithelial
                     cells to the basal lamina, also links to intermediate filaments. Gap junctions are unique: they
                     provide direct connection between adjacent cells and are not linked to the cytoskeleton. Molecular
                     aspects of cell adhesion molecules will be considered first and then integrated with the junctional
                     cytoskeleton to define specific structural and molecular aspects of different intercellular

                           form a zipper-like structure that stabilizes tight adhesion between cells.</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p5183">The cytoplasmic tail recruits proteins of the catenin complex:
                           β-catenin is the first to be recruited. The cadherin–β-catenin complex rapidly recruits
                           α-catenin which binds directly to F-actin and coordinates the activity of actin-nucleating
                           proteins and actin-binding partners (such as vinculin and α-actinin) to provide the dynamic
                           forces that modulate cell–cell adhesion: p120-catenin binds to the cytoplasmic tail of
                           cadherin and becomes a positive regulator of cadherin function.</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p5189">Different cell types possess different members of the cadherin
                           family, e.g. N-cadherins in nervous tissue, E-cadherins in epithelia and P-cadherins in the
                           placenta. Two further members of the cadherin family are the desmogleins and the
                           desmocollins. Cadherins are present in maculae adherentes and desmosomes but not in tight
                           junctions or hemidesmosomes (see below). Alterations in the expression of cadherins in the

                        or zonulae occludentes); anchoring junctions (including zonulae adherentes, or belt desmosomes,
                        and maculae adherentes, or spot desmosomes); and communication junctions, represented by gap
                        junctions. Tight junctions and anchoring junctions are components of the epithelial apical

                           apical junctional complex. The main functions of tight junctions are the regulation of the
                           paracellular permeability of the epithelial layer and the formation of an apical–basolateral
                           intramembrane diffusion barrier, the hallmark of epithelial cell polarity. Tight junctions
                           form a continuous belt (zonula) around the cell perimeter, near the apical domain of
                           epithelial cells, and are connected to the actin cytoskeleton. At the site of the tight

                           between them is obliterated. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy shows that the contact

                           with F-actin; and cytosolic zonula occludens proteins 1, 2 and 3 (ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3). ZO-1
                           protein is associated with afadin and the intracellular domain of JAMs. All three ZO proteins
                           facilitate the reciprocal interaction of occludins, claudins and JAMs with F-actin. Defects

               reversibly arrested quiescent cells in G<sub>0</sub> of the cell cycle, senescent growth arrest is
               irreversible; cells in this state cannot be stimulated to proliferate by known stimuli and cannot be

               dysfunctional with each DNA replication round. Telomere shortening has been shown to activate DNA damage
               responses, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (a decrease in production of ATP and an increase in
               reactive oxygen species) and the activation of p53, which induces growth arrest, apoptosis and senescence
               of stem cells and progenitor cells. p53 interconnects with different longevity metabolic signalling
               pathways, including the insulin, insulin-like growth factor I (IGFI) and mammalian target of rapamycin
               (mTOR) pathways, which are known to regulate lifespan by increasing the expression of genes involved in
               stress resistance and energy balance. Mutations in TERC (the RNA component of telomerase) and TERT (the
               catalytic component of telomerase) are found in patients with dyskeratosis congenita (an example of a
               premature ageing syndrome), a bone marrow failure syndrome classically associated with a triad of
               mucocutaneous features: nail dystrophy, oral leukoplakia and abnormal reticulate skin pigmentation. Other
               important contributors to cell senescence are dysregulated autophagy and lack of disposal of misfolded

               <div class="textfl" id="p5213">Cells die as a result of either tissue injury (necrosis) or the internal
                  activation of a ‘suicide’ programme (apoptosis) in response to extrinsic or intrinsic cues. Apoptosis
                  (programmed cell death) is defined by the controlled demolition of cellular constituents and the
                  ultimate uptake of apoptotic cell fragments by other cells to prevent immune responses. Some senescent
                  cells become resistant to cell-death signalling, i.e. they are apoptosis-resistant. In effect,
                  senescence blocks growth of damaged or stressed cells, whereas apoptosis quickly disposes of them.
                  Apoptosis is a central mechanism controlling multicellular development. During morphogenesis,
                  apoptosis mediates activities such as the separation of the developing digits, and plays an important
                  role in regulating the number of neurones in the nervous system (the majority of neurones die during
                  development). Apoptosis also ensures that inappropriate or inefficient T cells are eliminated in the
                  thymus during clonal selection.</div>
               <div class="text" id="p5214">The morphological changes exhibited by necrotic cells are very different
                  from those seen in apoptotic cells. Necrotic cells swell and subsequently rupture, and the resulting
                  debris may induce an inflammatory response. Apoptotic cells shrink, their nuclei and chromosomes
                  fragment, forming apoptotic bodies, and their plasma membranes undergo conformational changes that act
                  as a signal to local phagocytes. The dead cells are removed rapidly, and as their intracellular
                  contents are not released into the extracellular environment, inflammatory reactions are avoided; the
                  apoptotic fragments also stimulate macrophages to release anti-inflammatory cytokines.</div>
               <div class="text" id="p5215">Apoptosis and cell proliferation are intimately coupled; several cell cycle
                  regulators can influence both cell division and apoptosis. The signals that trigger apoptosis include
                  withdrawal of survival factors or exposure to inappropriate proliferative stimuli. Three main routes
                  to the induction of apoptosis have been established (<a href="#f0145"><span class="bold">Fig.
                        1.28</span></a>). Two, the Fas ligand (FasL) pathway and the granzyme B pathway, are extrinsic,
                  whereas the mitochondrial route is intrinsic. The FasL pathway involves binding of FasL to death
                  receptors on the plasma membrane and recruitment of adaptor proteins, such as the Fas-associated death
                  domain proteins, followed by the recruitment and activation of caspase 8. The granzyme B pathway
                  involves creation of a perforin plasma membrane channel enabling the caspase-like granzyme B to enter
                  the cell. The intrinsic mitochondrial route involves the release of cytochrome <span
                     class="italic">c</span> from the space between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes into the
                  cytosol. Extrinsic and intrinsic pathways work cooperatively in the subsequent activation of a family
                  of initiator-effector proteases, known as caspases (cysteine aspartic acid-specific proteases), which
                  are present in healthy cells as inactive precursor enzymes or zymogens. Activation of caspases 3, 6
                  and 7 mediates apoptosis by initiating a cascade of degradative processes that target major
                  constituents of the cell cytoskeleton, producing membrane blebbing, a distinctive feature of apoptosis
                  caused by cytosolic and nuclear fragments flowing into the developing apoptotic bodies. Caspase
                  cleavage inactivates many systems that normally promote damage repair and support cell viability, and
                  activates a number of proteins that promote the death and disassembly of the cell. For further reading

                                 1. Assembly of a phagophore involves a membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the
                                 conjugation of Atg (autophagy)5–Atg12 proteins interacting with Atg16L, and the
                                 insertion of LC3 (light chain 3). 2. The presence of LC3 in the extended and fused
                                 membranes of the autophagosome facilitates enclosure of a mitochondrion for
                                 degradation. The Atg5–12/Atg16L multimeric complex and some LC3 are then recycled. 3. A

                                 attaches the first ubiquitin molecule to the target protein, followed by the

                                 Parkin (like E3 in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway) is recruited by the protein kinase

                        of cell death (when the intensity and duration of stress are excessive). The process of
                        autophagy starts with the phagophore, a cytomembrane derived from the endoplasmic reticulum,
                        Golgi or plasma membrane. The phagophore expands, surrounds and encloses a cytoplasmic component
                        (such as a mitochondrion) that is captured within a double membrane structure, the
                        autophagosome. Autophagy is a cellular cleansing and recycling pathway; apoptosis often occurs
                        in the same cell, when autophagy precedes apoptosis.</div>
                     <div class="text" id="p5218">The 26S proteasome is a multicatalytic protease found in the cytosol
                        and the nucleus that degrades intracellular proteins conjugated to a polyubiquitin chain by an
                        enzymatic cascade. The 26S proteasome consists of several subunits arranged into two 19S polar
                        caps, where protein recognition and adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)-dependent target processing
                        occur, flanking a 20S central barrel-shaped structure with an inner proteolytic chamber (<a

                           2013</a>). The 26S proteasome participates in the removal of misfolded or abnormally
                        assembled proteins, the degradation of cyclins involved in the control of the cell cycle, the
                        processing and degradation of transcription regulators, cellular-mediated immune responses, and
                        cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.</div>
                     <div class="text" id="p5219">The mitophagy signalling pathway involves two enzymes: Parkin, a
                        ubiquitin ligase that is located in the cytoplasm in an inactive form, and PINK1, a protein
                        kinase, associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane. In response to mitochondrial damage,
                        PINK1 recruits and activates Parkin: activated Parkin exerts its ubiquitin ligase activity by
                        transferring polyubiquitin to proteins attached to the outer mitochondrial membrane.
                        Ubiquitin-tagged proteins are recognized by the proteasomal proteolytic machinery to initiate
                        mitochondrial degradation. The goal of the Parkin–PINK1 complex is to eliminate defective
                        mitochondria. If the Parkin–PINK1 complex is defective, dysfunctional mitochondria are not
                        cleared and cell function is compromised. Parkinson’s disease is an example of a
                        neurodegenerative disease caused by mitochondrial dysfunction determined by mutations in the
                        ubiquitin ligase Parkin and protein kinase (PINK1). There is a clear difference between the
                        lysosome-based autophagy pathway and the ubiquitin-proteasome-based mitophagy signalling pathway
                        that is recruited in the removal of aged or damaged mitochondria.</div>
                     <div class="text" id="p5220">The apoptosis pathway is concerned with the turnover of entire cells.
                        While apoptosis and the ubiquitin-proteasome activities take place in the cytosol, autophagy
                        occurs within a sealed compartment, the autophagosome, with the assistance of lysosomes. Defects
                        in mitochondrial function are the cause of reactive oxidative stress and specific
                        neurodegenerative disorders, such as some familial forms of Parkinson’s disease.</div>
