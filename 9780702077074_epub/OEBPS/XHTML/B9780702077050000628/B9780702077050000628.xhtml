The organization of the peritoneal cavity is determined by that of the peritoneum. The latter is determined by anatomy of the mesentery and abdominal digestive organs. The chapter thus commences with a description of mesenteric and digestive organ anatomy. A description of peritoneal anatomy follows and includes an explanation of the peritoneal cavity. Abnormalities of mesenteric, peritoneal and peritoneal cavity anatomy can then be described and explained. The chapter gives the student the anatomical foundation to build a logical and robust model of abdominal anatomy applicable to all basic and clinical disciplines. This in turn enables the student to understand the anatomical basis of an array of abdominal diseases.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">cavity; fascia; mesentery; peritoneum</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The peritoneum is the largest serous membrane in the body. In males the peritoneum forms a closed sac, but in females it is open at the abdominal ostia of the uterine tubes. Its smooth appearance is unremarkable, but its conformation varies. Directly beneath the single layer of mesothelium is a well-developed basement membrane, outside which is a rich lymphatic plexus. Microscopic mesothelial pores or peritoneal stomata are distributed throughout the peritoneum but particularly on the undersurface of the respiratory diaphragm and anterior abdominal wall (<a href="#bib46" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_46">Wassilev et al 1998</a>). At the peritoneal stomata the mesothelium is close to underlying lymphatic endothelial cells and there is no intervening basement membrane. Both peritoneal stomata and sites of macrophage and lymphoid aggregates (‘milky spots’) in the omenta contribute to peritoneal fluid absorption, and their occlusion by malignant cells can result in ascites (<a href="#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_24">diZerega and Rodgers 1992</a>, <a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_26">Hagiwara et al 1994</a>). Neighbouring mesothelial cells are joined by junctional complexes but permit macrophages to pass. Some regions of the submesothelial connective tissue also contain macrophages, lymphocytes and adipocytes.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">The normal pressure within the peritoneal cavity is about 2–10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mmHg (higher in pregnant and obese individuals) (<a href="#bib39" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_39">Sanchez et al 2001</a>). It can be measured directly using a catheter inserted into the abdomen, or indirectly by monitoring the pressure in the urinary bladder or stomach. The pressure inside the abdomen can increase after trauma as a result of the accumulation of blood, fluid or oedema, leading to ‘abdominal compartment syndrome’. In such patients, monitoring of intra-abdominal pressure can identify major increases (above about 25<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mmHg) that could jeopardize blood flow to vital organs and dictate the need for urgent decompression.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Peritoneal Fluid</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0020">The peritoneal cavity lies between the parietal peritoneum, which lines the abdominal walls, the visceral peritoneum (covering abdominal viscera and mesentery) and the peritoneal reflection. It contains a small amount of peritoneal fluid, rarely more than 5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>ml in healthy males and postmenopausal females (<a href="#bib47" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_47">Yoshikawa et al 2013</a>). Up to 25<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>ml of fluid can be present in healthy young females, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle (<a href="#bib30" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_30">Koninckx et al 1980</a>). The fluid allows the viscera covered with peritoneum, i.e. intermesenteric, to glide freely within the peritoneal cavity. Normal peritoneal fluid contains water, proteins (less than 30<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>g per litre), electrolytes and solutes derived from interstitial fluid in the adjacent tissues and from plasma in local capillaries. It also contains a few cells, including desquamated mesothelium, nomadic peritoneal macrophages, mast cells, fibroblasts, lymphocytes and other leukocytes. Macrophages migrate freely between the peritoneal cavity and the surrounding connective tissue. In females, blood or fluid can enter the peritoneal cavity from a ruptured ovarian follicle or from the retrograde flow of menstrual fluid along the uterine tubes (which can cause endometriosis). Under normal circumstances, the peritoneal cavity contains no air.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">The peritoneum and its fluid have important defensive properties (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Autio 1964</a>). Peritoneal fluid flows in a predominantly clockwise direction around the peritoneal cavity and gravitates to dependent sites within the cavity: diaphragmatic respiratory movements, negative intrathoracic pressure and intestinal peristalsis encourage flow from the pelvis to the subphrenic regions, even when the individual is erect (<a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Meyers et al 1987</a>, <a href="#bib33" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_33">Meyers 1994</a>). Fluid preferentially ascends from the inferior abdomen and pelvis to the right subhepatic and subphrenic spaces via the right paracolic gutter (deeper than the left paracolic gutter in the supine position and there is no phrenicocolic ligament or reflection to obstruct flow) (<a href="#bib32" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_32">Meyers 1973</a>). Passage across the midline to the left subphrenic space is prevented by the falciform ligament. Malignant cells can become trapped within peritoneal recesses or in the milky spots of the greater omentum, where they proliferate and produce visible and palpable tumour deposits. These sites must be deliberately examined during searches for peritoneal metastases (<a href="#bib48" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_48">Zonca et al 2008</a>). Gross infiltration of the omentum by cancer is often referred to as an ‘omental cake’. The movement of peritoneal fluid explains the presence of disease at sites such as the undersurface of the right half of the respiratory diaphragm and the pelvic pouches. An example is Fitz–Hugh–Curtis syndrome, in which organisms causing gonorrhoea or chlamydia organisms enter the peritoneal cavity through the uterine tubes and are transported in the peritoneal fluid to the right upper quadrant, where they cause perihepatic inflammation. Disruption of the integrity of the peritoneum by percutaneous puncture, laparoscopy or open surgery profoundly affects its defensive function and can create ‘sticky’ sites where pathogens or malignant cells can settle and proliferate.</div><div class="text" id="p0030">Rarely there are direct communications (pleuroperitoneal fenestrae) between the peritoneal and pleural cavities (<a href="#bib42" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_42">Simmons and Mir 1989</a>, <a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">Pestieau et al 2000</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0015"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0025">Peritoneal Attachments</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0035">The parietal peritoneum is attached to the muscular layers of the abdominal wall by extraperitoneal connective tissue. It detaches from the abdominal wall to continue as the visceral peritoneum of nearby viscera (including the mesentery). The region of detachment is referred to as the peritoneal reflection (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 62.1A</span></a>). The parietal peritoneum is only loosely attached around the urinary bladder and rectum so as to accommodate alterations in their size, whereas it adheres firmly to the inferior surface of the respiratory diaphragm and linea alba. The extraperitoneal tissue over the posterior abdominal wall frequently contains large amounts of fat, especially in obese males. Visceral peritoneum adheres firmly to the underlying viscera, often blends with connective tissue in the wall of the organ and rarely contains loose connective or adipose tissue.</div></section><section><a id="sf0010"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000628/main.assets/f62-01a-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000628/main.assets/f62-01b-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 62.1</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, The posterior abdominal wall, showing the lines of peritoneal reflection, after removal of the liver, spleen, stomach, jejunum, ileum, caecum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon.

The mesentery is derived from the dorsal and ventral mesenteries. The rotation and subsequent attachment of parts of the gastrointestinal tract to the posterior abdominal wall create the impression that these structures are retroperitoneal. However, it is now acknowledged that the mesentery is continuous and that all regions of the intestine are centrally connected via the attached mesentery (<a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Byrnes et al 2019a–2019d</a>) (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 62.1A</a>). The intestines can be divided into attached and non-attached regions. Attached regions include the duodenum, ascending and descending colons and the rectum. Non-attached regions include the stomach, small intestine, and the transverse and sigmoid colon.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">The mesentery is continuous from the gastro-oesophageal to the anorectal junctions (<a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Byrnes et al 2019a–2019d</a>). All abdominal digestive organs are continuous with a region of the mesenteric frame. Some regions (the greater and lesser omenta) differ considerably in appearance from others, including the mesocolon and mesosigmoid (sigmoid mesocolon). Where the parietal peritoneum detaches from the abdominal wall as the peritoneal reflection, and extends to adjacent viscera such as the liver, it is often termed a ‘ligament’. The mesentery contains neurovascular bundles and lymphatic <span class="bold">vessels</span> that supply digestive system organs. In individuals with obesity, extensive adipose tissue within the mesentery can obscure neurovascular bundles. In contrast, in the very young, elderly or malnourished, the mesentery lacks adipose tissue and neurovascular bundles are more obvious within ‘mesenteric pedicles’ that are routinely used as anatomical landmarks to guide abdominal surgeons.</div><div class="text" id="p0050">The surfaces of viscera attached to the mesentery contribute to the visceral component of the peritoneal landscape.

The surgeon incises the peritoneum to access the plane between the mesentery and underlying fascia (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 62.1B</span></a>). When the intact mesentery has been detached from the fascia back to the midline, it can be disconnected by dividing major vascular trunks.

It extends inferiorly to the level of the umbilicus and superiorly it narrows to a depth of 1–2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm as the distance between the liver and anterior abdominal wall decreases. Its two peritoneal layers separate to enclose the liver, to which it adheres firmly. Superiorly, the two peritoneal layers are continuous with the parietal peritoneum on the undersurface of the respiratory diaphragm, from which they are reflected laterally to form the superior layer of the coronary ligament of the liver on the right and the left triangular ligament of the liver on the left. The inferior aspect of the falciform ligament forms a free border, where the two peritoneal layers are continuous with each other as they enclose the round ligament of the liver (ligamentum teres hepatis), a remnant of the umbilical vein. Because the peritoneum of the falciform ligament is continuous with that covering the posterior abdominal wall and with the parietal peritoneum of the anterior abdominal wall, blood from a retroperitoneal haemorrhage (commonly, acute haemorrhagic pancreatitis) can track beneath the peritoneum and appear as haemorrhagic discoloration around the umbilicus (Cullen’s sign). The blood-tinged fluid reaches the peri-umbilical region via the lesser omentum and the falciform ligament.</div></section><section><a id="s0055"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0050">Peritoneal and mesenteric connections of the liver</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0070">The liver is almost completely covered in visceral peritoneum, and only the ‘bare area’ posteriorly is directly apposed to the right half of the respiratory diaphragm.

Between the two layers of this ligament, a large triangular area, the bare area of the liver, is devoid of peritoneal covering. Here, the liver is connected to, but separated from, the respiratory diaphragm by a thin layer of areolar tissue. On the right, the two layers of the coronary ligament converge laterally to form the right triangular ligament. On the left, the two layers of peritoneal reflection fuse to form the left triangular ligament. The superior layer of the coronary ligament is reflected superiorly onto the undersurface of the diaphragm and inferiorly onto the right and superior surfaces of the liver. The inferior layer of the coronary ligament is reflected inferiorly from the posterior surface of the liver onto the posterior abdominal wall, where it is continuous with the parietal peritoneum overlying the right kidney, and continues to the superior (first) part of the duodenum and right colic flexure (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 62.3</a>). Medially, it passes in front of a short segment of the inferior vena cava lying between the superior part of the duodenum inferiorly and the caudate process of the liver superiorly, forming the posterior wall of the omental foramen. It continues to the left as the peritoneum overlying the anterior surface of the dorsal mesogastrium, turns anteriorly and continues as the undersurface of the greater omentum.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">The peritoneal recess between the inferior surface of the liver and the colic component of the right colic flexure is known as the hepatorenal recess (pouch of Morison) (<a href="#bib43" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_43">Stringer 2009</a>). In the supine position, this is the most dependent part of the peritoneal cavity in the upper abdomen and is a site toward which fluid or peritoneal metastases can gravitate.</div><div class="text" id="p0085">The right triangular ligament is a short, V-shaped fold at the right lateral limit of the bare area of the liver where the two layers of the coronary ligament converge.

The left triangular ligament lies anterior to the abdominal part of the oesophagus, the superior limits of the lesser omentum, and part of the fundus of the stomach. It is continuous with the parietal peritoneum lining the undersurface of the left side of the respiratory diaphragm, which is continuous with the parietal peritoneum lining the posterior abdominal wall.

Formed by two layers of peritoneum separated by a variable amount of connective tissue and fat, it runs between the inferior, visceral surface of the liver and the abdominal part of the oesophagus, stomach, pylorus and superior part of the duodenum. Superiorly, its attachment to the inferior surface of the liver forms an L shape. The <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1153" id="pagebreak_1153"/><a id="pg1153"/>vertical component of the L shape is formed by the fissure for the ligamentum venosum, and inferiorly, the attachment turns horizontally to complete the L in the porta hepatis. The part of the lesser omentum running between the liver and the stomach is the hepatogastric ligament and the part between the liver and duodenum is the hepatoduodenal ligament. The right and left gastric vessels, branches of the vagal trunks and lymph nodes are contained within the two layers of the hepatogastric ligament close to its attachment to the stomach. An accessory or replaced left hepatic artery is sometimes present. The anterior layer of the lesser omentum descends from the fissure for the ligamentum venosum on to the anterior surface of the abdominal part of the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum. The posterior layer descends from the fissure and runs on to the posterior surface and pylorus of the stomach: it forms part of the anterior surface of the omental bursa (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 62.4</a>). At the lesser curvature of the stomach, the peritoneal layers of the lesser omentum become continuous with the visceral peritoneum covering the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stomach.</div><div class="text" id="p0100">The free right lateral border of the lesser omentum (i.e. the hepatoduodenal ligament) is thickened to form a mesenteric pedicle that extends from the porta hepatis to the junction between the superior and descending (second) parts of the duodenum. It forms the anterior boundary of the omental foramen and contains the hepatic portal vein (posteriorly), the bile duct (anteriorly to the right) and proper hepatic artery (anteriorly to the left) (see <a href="#f0020">Figs 62.3</a>, <a href="#f0030">62.5B</a>), together with lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes and hepatic autonomic nerves. An accessory or replaced right hepatic artery sometimes arises from the superior mesenteric artery in the free edge of the lesser omentum, usually running posterior to the hepatic portal vein. Often the free margin of the lesser omentum extends to the right as the cystoduodenal ligament that contains the gallbladder, cystic artery and duct and lymph nodes (<a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_10">Ashaolu et al 2011</a>). This is of considerable clinical significance: this mesenteric appendage must be visualized in order to remove the gallbladder safely (i.e. cholecystectomy). The hepatoduodenal ligament continues distally posterior to the superior part of the duodenum and merges with the mesentery of the duodenum.</div><div class="text" id="p0105">The superior border of the lesser omentum is short and runs over the inferior surface of the respiratory diaphragm between the liver and the medial aspect of the abdominal part of the oesophagus. The lesser omentum is thinner in this region and contains a variable amount of connective tissue, especially fat. It has a translucent appearance where it is thinnest, a feature that guides surgeons in identifying regions that can be divided safely.</div></section><section><a id="s0065"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0060">Greater omentum</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0110">The greater omentum is the largest peritoneal fold and hangs inferiorly from the greater curvature of the stomach. When the undisturbed abdomen is opened, the greater omentum is frequently draped over the superior abdominal organs, but often not in the even distribution shown in many illustrations. It is usually thin but always contains some adipose tissue and is a common site for storage of fat in obese individuals, particularly males (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Coulier 2009</a>). The greater omentum <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1154" id="pagebreak_1154"/><a id="pg1154"/>is a double sheet: each sheet consists of two layers of peritoneum separated by a small amount of connective tissue. The two sheets are folded back on themselves and adhere firmly to each other inferior to the transverse colon. Above this level the anterior sheet separates from the posterior sheet and is attached to the greater curvature of the stomach (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 62.4</a>); this supracolic part of the greater omentum is known as the gastrocolic ligament. The most anterior layer of peritoneum of the greater omentum is continuous with the visceral peritoneum over the anterior surface of the stomach and duodenum. The anterior sheet descends from the greater curvature of the stomach and superior part of the duodenum for a variable distance into the peritoneal cavity and then turns sharply backwards on itself to ascend as the posterior sheet. The posterior sheet is extremely thin where it attaches to the transverse colon and superior surface of the transverse mesocolon. It extends cephalad, attached to (but not fused with) the superior surface of the transverse mesocolon, until it reaches the inferior border of the body and head of the pancreas (see <a href="#f0025">Figs 62.4</a>, <a href="#f0030">62.5C</a>). At the pancreas the anterior layer envelops the pancreas and continues cephalad as the dorsal mesogastrium (see above). During surgery, the transverse mesocolon and greater omentum are separated by dividing through the posterior layer of the greater omentum, where this first attaches to the transverse colon. Alternatively, surgeons frequently divide directly through the greater omentum at the level where it approaches the greater curvature of the stomach. These activities are essential for gaining entry into the omental bursa.</div><div class="text" id="p0115">On the left side of the abdomen, the greater omentum is attached to the gastrosplenic ligament or the peritoneal reflection in this region; on the right side, it extends to the beginning of the duodenum (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 62.4</a>). A region of peritoneal reflection, the hepatocolic ligament, always extends from the inferior surface of the right lobe of the liver to the right colic flexure. The right border of the greater omentum usually adheres to the anterior surface of this region of reflection and thereafter to the right colic flexure and superior part of the ascending colon. In individuals, with obesity the right border of the greater omentum often extends laterally to adhere to the lateral border of the ascending colon and its associated region of peritoneal reflection (Jackson’s membrane). Less commonly, the left border of the greater omentum adheres to the anterior surface of the descending colon.</div><div class="text" id="p0120">The greater omentum has a rich blood supply derived from the right and left gastro-omental (gastro-epiploic) vessels that run between the two peritoneal layers of the anterior sheet of greater omentum, close to the greater curvature of the stomach. These vessels give off numerous omental branches that run the length of the omentum. Microscopic capillary convolutions, sometimes termed ‘omental glomeruli’, lie directly beneath the mesothelium of the greater omentum. They are surrounded by aggregations of macrophages and lymphocytes (milky spots) that drain into lymphatic vessels (<a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">Shimotsuma et al 1993</a>); the macrophages form clusters near the mesothelial surface, while B and T lymphocytes are grouped around vessels. The fenestrated endothelium lining the omental glomeruli and the mesothelium overlying the milky spots form sites of leukocyte migration and peritoneal fluid absorption (<a href="#bib37" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_37">Platell et al 2000</a>). The number and size of milky spots increase when there is peritoneal inflammation, highlighting their defensive role.</div><div class="text" id="p0125">The greater omentum serves several important functions. It is highly mobile and frequently adheres to inflamed viscera or foreign bodies within the abdominal cavity. This can limit the spread of infection, as in the walling-off of acute appendicitis, and promote haemostasis. However, it can also block peritoneal drains and catheters (such that omentectomy is sometimes performed when intraperitoneal catheters are placed). It absorbs peritoneal fluid. It contains macrophages and lymphoid tissue capable of destroying pathogens; for example, macrophages and neutrophils readily migrate from the greater omentum into the peritoneal cavity when there is peritonitis. It promotes neovascularization of the structures to which it adheres and thus promotes healing of ischaemic tissues and supports splenic autotransplantation (<a href="../B9780702077050000690/B9780702077050000690.xhtml">Ch. 69</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0130">The remarkable capacity of the greater omentum to participate in reparative processes is highlighted by its use as an omental pedicle flap or free flap in reconstructive surgery: it has been used to support closure of gastrointestinal perforations, fill ‘dead space’ after surgical excision of pathology, and cover wound defects. A greater omental pedicle or free flap based on the right gastro-omental vessels can be mobilized by dividing the gastric branches of these vessels close to the surface of the stomach and the left gastro-omental vessels near their origin.</div></section><section><a id="s0070"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0065">Peritoneal connections of the spleen</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0135">The peritoneal connections of the spleen anchor it in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Although they are called ligaments, they are regions of peritoneal reflection from the parietal peritoneum of the left upper quadrant to the spleen. They include the gastrosplenic, splenorenal and phrenicocolic ligaments. The gastrosplenic ligament runs between the greater curvature of the stomach and the splenic hilum, and is the cephalad continuation of the greater omentum. The peritoneal layers of the gastrosplenic ligament separate to enclose the spleen. The outer layer then detaches from the spleen to form the splenorenal and phrenicocolic ligaments that continue posteriorly as the dorsal mesogastrium, forming the posterior wall of the omental bursa. The splenorenal ligament extends from the spleen to the posterior abdominal wall and the phrenicocolic ligament connects the left colic flexure to the respiratory diaphragm.</div><div class="text" id="p0140">The splenorenal ligament (see <a href="#f0010">Figs 62.1</a>, <a href="#f0030">62.5B</a>) is continuous medially with the peritoneum of the posterior wall of the omental bursa over the left kidney and runs up to the splenic hilum, where it is continuous with the posterior layer of the gastrosplenic ligament. The posterior layer of the splenorenal ligament is continuous laterally with the peritoneum over the inferior surface of the respiratory diaphragm and runs onto the splenic surface over the renal impression. The splenic vessels lie between the layers of the splenorenal ligament; the tail of the pancreas is usually present in its inferior portion.</div><div class="text" id="p0145">As the gastrosplenic ligament is a cephalad extension of the greater omentum, it also consists of two layers of peritoneum (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 62.5B</a>). The posterior layer is continuous with the peritoneum of the splenic hilum and the peritoneum over the posterior surface of the stomach. This layer continues medially as the anterior surface of the dorsal mesogastrium. The anterior layer is continuous with the peritoneum reflected off the gastric impression of the spleen and with the peritoneum over the anterior surface of the stomach. The short gastric and left gastro-omental branches of the splenic artery, with their corresponding veins, pass between the layers of the gastrosplenic ligament.</div><div class="text" id="p0150">The phrenicocolic ligament is a region of peritoneal reflection extending from the colic component of the left colic flexure to the adjacent parietal peritoneum. Medially, it is attached to the left border of the greater omentum. Inferiorly, it continues as the left lateral reflection. Superiorly, it continues as the splenorenal ligament or region of reflection.</div><div class="text" id="p0155">Undue traction on the peritoneal attachments of the spleen at surgery can cause a capsular tear and serious bleeding. A clear understanding of peritoneal anatomy in this region is therefore essential for the surgeon. Downward traction on the phrenicocolic ligament during mobilization of the left colic flexure is particularly hazardous; medial traction on the greater omentum can also injure the spleen if the omentum adheres to the fibrous capsule of the spleen. Unfortunately, surgical trauma is the main cause for splenectomy.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0075"/><section><a id="s0080"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0070">Peritoneum of the lower abdomen</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0160">The posterior surface of the inferior anterior abdominal wall is lined by parietal peritoneum, which extends from the linea alba centrally to the lateral paracolic gutters, where it is reflected over the front and sides of the ascending colon on the right and the descending colons on the left (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 62.5C</a>). The ascending and descending colons are now regarded as having attached regions of mesentery (i.e. the right and left mesocolon respectively). The surface of the viscus is considered to be lined by visceral peritoneum that is continuous with the parietal peritoneum at regions of peritoneal reflection. In keeping with this, the parietal peritoneum is reflected onto the small intestine mesentery where this approaches the posterior abdominal wall, and continues laterally as the right mesocolon. The anatomical organization of the small and large intestines and associated mesentery explain the organization of their surrounding peritoneal reflection at all levels from the duodenojejunal flexure to the mesorectum.</div><section><a id="s0085"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0075">Transverse mesocolon</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0165">The mesentery of the transverse colon is a region of the mesentery associated with the large intestine that suspends the transverse colon in the peritoneal cavity. The transverse mesocolon attaches centrally and obliquely from the anterior aspect of the descending part of the duodenum, over the head and neck of the pancreas superior to the duodenojejunal junction, and over the superior pole of the left kidney to the left colic flexure (see <a href="#f0015">Figs 62.2</a>–<a href="#f0025">62.4</a>). It contains the middle colic vessels and their branches, together with autonomic nerves from the aortic plexus, lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes. Near the left colic flexure, the ascending branch of the left colic artery terminates within the transverse mesocolon. Its two peritoneal layers pass to the posterior surface of the transverse colon, where they separate to invest it. In between the flexures, the superior layer of mesocolic peritoneum is attached to the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1155" id="pagebreak_1155"/><a id="pg1155"/>posterior layer of the greater omentum (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 62.4</a>). The inferior layer of peritoneum is continuous with the anterior surface of the mesentery of the small intestine and right mesocolon in the midline and to the right, and with the anterior surface of the left mesocolon to the left.

It continues as the right mesocolon, and where it does so it is attached to the posterior abdominal wall, although the attachment of mesentery to posterior abdominal wall is obscured by the peritoneal reflection at this level. The mesentery of the small intestine and the right and transverse mesocolon converge on a central region that is more appropriately termed the root of the mesentery. Jejunal and ileal branches of the superior mesenteric vessels, nerves related to the superior mesenteric plexus, lymphatic vessels and regional lymph nodes, all lie in the adipose tissue of the mesentery of the small intestine. The length and mobility of this mesentery can make it difficult to determine the site and orientation of a loop of small intestine through a small surgical incision. Tracing the continuity of a peritoneal layer of mesentery onto the posterior abdominal wall can be useful for orientating an isolated loop if the duodenojejunal flexure or ileocaecal junction is not readily accessible.</div></section><section><a id="s9000"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle9085">Right mesocolon</h4><div class="textfl" id="p9000">The right mesocolon is a continuation of the mesentery of the small intestine.

Where the small intestinal region of the mesentery continues as the right mesocolon, a mesothelial bridge (reflection) between the visceral peritoneum of the mesentery and the parietal peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall is an important anatomical landmark defining the medial boundary of the right mesocolon (<a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Byrnes et al 2019a–2019d</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0095"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0085">Meso-appendix</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0175">The mesentery of the appendix, the meso-appendix, arises from the posterior surface of the mesentery in the ileocaecal region. It attaches to the appendix along its length, but it can end just short of the distal end of the appendix. It encloses the blood vessels, nerves and lymph vessels of the appendix and usually contains a lymph node. A fold of peritoneum is sometimes observed between the terminal ileum and the anterior layer of the meso-appendix (the ‘bloodless fold of Treves’). The position of the meso-appendix is of considerable clinical importance. As it arises from the posterior surface of the main body of the mesentery, the appendix frequently takes up a retrocaecal position. Its positioning in this location means that appendicitis is often a difficult diagnosis, and that the appendix and meso-appendix can be difficult to expose and divide during surgery.</div></section><section><a id="s9015"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle9090">Left mesocolon</h4><div class="textfl" id="p9005">The left mesocolon is the region of mesocolon between the transverse mesocolon proximally and the sigmoid mesocolon distally.

Laterally, this region separates from the posterior abdominal wall as the mobile region of the sigmoid mesocolon. The medial and lateral boundaries of the attached region of sigmoid mesocolon are obscured from direct visualization by the peritoneal reflection at this level. Bands of peritoneum can run from the proximal sigmoid colon to the abdominal wall in the left iliac fossa: they are congenital adhesions that are often mistaken for the peritoneal reflection at this level.

Parietal peritoneum is supplied by the somatic blood vessels of the abdominal and pelvic walls, and its lymphatics join vessels in the body wall and drain to parietal nodes. Visceral peritoneum is best considered as an integral part of the viscus it covers; its blood supply and lymphatic drainage therefore correspond to those of the associated viscus. The region between, i.e. the peritoneal reflection, represents a transitional zone in terms of the origins of its vascular and lymphatic drainage and innervation.</div></section><section><a id="s0140"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0120">Innervation</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0215">The parietal peritoneum is innervated by somatic efferent and afferent nerves that also supply the muscles and skin of the overlying body wall. The visceral peritoneum is innervated by afferent nerves that travel with the autonomic supply in the mesentery to the underlying viscera. Sensations arising from pathologies that affect the parietal or visceral peritoneum reflect these different patterns of innervation. Well-localized pain is elicited by mechanical, thermal or chemical stimulation of nociceptors in the parietal peritoneum; the pain is usually limited to the affected region. Somatic nerves that innervate the parietal peritoneum also supply the corresponding segmental skin and muscles: when the parietal peritoneum is irritated there is local reflex muscle contraction, resulting in clinical signs of guarding or even rigidity of the anterior abdominal wall. The parietal peritoneum covering the respiratory diaphragm is supplied centrally by afferent fibres from the phrenic nerves and peripherally by the inferior intercostal nerves and subcostal nerves: peripheral irritation of the diaphragm can therefore result in pain localized in the distribution of the inferior thoracic spinal nerves, while central irritation causes referred pain in the cutaneous distribution of the third to fifth cervical spinal nerves (the shoulder region). The innervation of the parietal peritoneum of the lesser pelvis is poorly documented.</div><div class="text" id="p0220">Irritation or stretching of the visceral peritoneum causes poorly localized discomfort. The sensation of pain is referred to a diffuse area of the abdominal wall. Discomfort from structures derived from the foregut is felt in the epigastric region; that from structures derived from the midgut in the umbilical region; and that from structures derived from the hindgut in the hypogastric region. None of these sensations is significantly lateralized. Pain from the pancreas, gallbladder and small intestine can radiate to the back. Stretching or irritation of the visceral peritoneum can also elicit profound reflex vasomotor and cardiac changes mediated by autonomic nerves, including a vasovagal response. This is of considerable clinical relevance. Painful responses to manipulation of the parietal peritoneum can be abolished by local or regional anaesthesia. In marked contrast, the direct central connections of visceral afferents, particularly via the vagus nerve, mean that stretching the visceral peritoneum can have profound effects, including acute haemodynamic instability, despite local or regional (including spinal) anaesthesia.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0145"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0125">General Arrangement of the Peritoneal Cavity</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0225">The peritoneum is organized into parietal and visceral parts and intervening areas of reflection (where the parietal peritoneum is reflected onto adjacent viscera with which it merges). Together, these form the peritoneal cavity. The region of the cavity that is attached to the lateral and anterior abdominal wall is relatively featureless. In contrast, while the contour of the reflection and visceral peritoneum appears more complex, it is explained by the shape of the underlying digestive system organs, including the mesentery. The cavity can be subdivided into the greater sac and the omental bursa. The greater sac is the main peritoneal cavity surrounding most of the abdominal and pelvic viscera. The omental bursa is a substantial diverticulum of the dorsal mesentery at this level and is situated posterior to the stomach and lesser omentum. The greater sac and omental bursa communicate via the omental foramen.</div><div class="text" id="p0230">For clinical purposes, the peritoneal cavity can be divided into several ‘spaces’ (see below); pathological processes are often contained within these spaces and their anatomy can influence diagnosis and treatment.

The posterior wall detaches at the inferior margin of the pancreas to continue distally over the superior surface of the transverse mesocolon. It detaches from the transverse colon to continue as the greater omentum (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 62.4</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0270">The inferior phrenic, splenic, left gastric and common hepatic arteries are located in the mesentery of the omental bursa: they use the frame of the bursa to travel to their target organs. The superior border of the omental bursa is narrow and lies between the right side of the abdominal part of the oesophagus and the superior end of the fissure for the ligamentum venosum and is sometimes referred to as the superior recess of the omental bursa. Here, the peritoneum of the posterior wall of the omental bursa is reflected anteriorly from the respiratory diaphragm to join the posterior layer of the lesser omentum.</div><div class="text" id="p0275">The right border of the omental bursa is where the peritoneum overlying the head and neck of the pancreas is reflected onto the inferior aspect of the superior part of the duodenum. The line of this reflection ascends to the left, along the medial side of the gastroduodenal artery. Near the superior border of the duodenum, the right border of the omental bursa joins the inferior aspect of the omental foramen round the proper hepatic artery. The omental foramen therefore interrupts the right border. Superior to the omental foramen, the right border is formed by the peritoneal reflection from the respiratory diaphragm to the right margin of the caudate lobe of the liver, which then crosses the inferior vena cava. The left border of the omental bursa runs from the left end of the transverse mesocolon and is mostly formed by the inner peritoneal layers of the splenorenal and gastrosplenic ligaments. The region of the omental bursa between the splenorenal and gastrosplenic ligaments is referred to as the splenic recess. Superior to the spleen, the two ligaments merge to form the short gastrophrenic ligament, which passes anteriorly from the respiratory diaphragm to the posterior aspect of the fundus of the stomach and forms part of the superior left border of the omental bursa. The two layers of the gastrophrenic ligament diverge near the abdominal part of the oesophagus, leaving part of the posterior surface of the stomach devoid of peritoneum. The left gastric artery runs forwards here into the lesser omentum.</div><div class="text" id="p0280">The omental bursa is indented by a crescentic mesenteric arch that runs from the superior border of the neck of the pancreas to the superior part of the lesser curvature of the stomach: it is variously described but commonly known as the gastropancreatic fold. The superior part of this arch contains the left gastric artery as it runs from the coeliac trunk to the lesser curvature of the stomach. The inferior part contains the common hepatic artery as it runs from the coeliac trunk to the lesser omentum. When the arch is prominent, it divides the omental bursa into a smaller superior and a larger inferior recess. The superior recess lies posterior to the lesser omentum and encloses the caudate lobe of the liver; it extends superiorly into the fissure for the ligamentum venosum and lies adjacent to the right crus of the respiratory diaphragm posteriorly. The inferior recess of the omental bursa lies between the stomach and pancreas, and is contained within the double sheet of greater omentum.</div><div class="text" id="p0285">Acute pancreatitis is probably the most common cause of a fluid collection within the omental bursa (or just posterior to its posterior wall).

The hepatoduodenal ligament, the thickened free right margin of the lesser omentum that extends between the porta hepatis above and the superior border of the superior part of the duodenum below, forms the anterior boundary of the omental foramen. Within this free border lie the bile duct (anteriorly on the right), the proper hepatic artery (anteriorly on the left) and the hepatic portal vein (posteriorly), together with nerves and lymphatics. Rapid control of the proper hepatic artery and hepatic portal vein can be exerted by compression of the free edge of the lesser omentum (a ‘Pringle’ manoeuvre), which is a potentially useful technique during surgery. Superiorly, the peritoneum of the posterior layer of the hepatoduodenal ligament runs over the caudate process of the liver, forming the roof of the omental foramen. This layer of peritoneum is then reflected onto the inferior vena cava, forming the posterior border of the foramen. The floor of the foramen is formed by the peritoneal reflection overlying the superior border of the superior part of the duodenum as it runs anteriorly, superior to the head of the pancreas. A narrow passage, the vestibule of the omental bursa, can be formed to the left of the foramen between the caudate process superiorly and the superior part of the duodenum inferiorly. To the right, the rim of the foramen is continuous with the peritoneum of the greater sac. The anterior and posterior walls of the foramen are normally apposed, which partly explains why patients can develop large fluid collections isolated to the greater sac or omental bursa (<a href="#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_41">Shrestha et al 2010</a>).</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0175"/><section><a id="s0180"/><section><a id="s0185"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0155">Left subphrenic space</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0295">The left subphrenic space lies between the respiratory diaphragm, the anterior and superior surfaces of the left lobe of the liver, the anterosuperior surface of the stomach and the diaphragmatic surface of the spleen.

In the absence of inflammation, peritoneal adhesions or previous surgery, serous fluid tends to be distributed widely between the peritoneal spaces. Simple ascites can therefore be drained freely from any convenient dependent part of the peritoneal cavity; drainage is most commonly performed by blind puncture or ultrasound-guided insertion of a catheter into the inferior left or right paracolic gutters. The mobility of the small intestine makes iatrogenic injury during this procedure very unlikely.</div><div class="text" id="p0430">Fluid collections caused by inflammatory processes are often much thicker because they contain purulence, fibrin or blood.

These factors predispose to the formation of localized fluid collections that can become walled-off as the inflammatory process progresses. Any region of the peritoneum can develop a localized collection, but the subphrenic and subhepatic spaces and pelvic pouches are the most common sites because they are well defined by the peritoneal folds and viscera that form their boundaries and they are the most dependent regions within the peritoneal cavity.</div><div class="text" id="p0435">Surgical access to the peritoneum is less often needed today because advances in radiologically guided percutaneous drainage using fluoroscopy, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer reliable and versatile methods for accessing the peritoneum, including relatively inaccessible subhepatic, perihepatic or intermesenteric collections. Posterolateral approaches or approaches through the greater sciatic foramen can be used to access the retroperitoneum or pelvis, respectively.
