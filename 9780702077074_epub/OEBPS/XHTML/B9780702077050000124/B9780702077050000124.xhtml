In mammalian embryos, axes cannot be specified at very early stages: embryonic axes can be defined only after the early extraembryonic structures have been formed and the inner cell mass can be seen. The position of the future epiblast can be predicted in human embryos when the hollow blastocyst has formed. The inner cell mass becomes (seemingly) randomly located on the inside of the trophectoderm and forms a population of epiblast cells subjacent to the trophoblast. This region implants first. It is not known whether the trophectoderm in contact with the inner cell mass initiates implantation, so that the future dorsal surface of the embryo is closest to the disrupted maternal vessels at the implantation site, or whether the inner cell mass can travel around the inside of the trophoblast to gain a position subjacent to the implantation site once implantation has started.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">Axes may be conferred on the whole embryonic disc, which is initially flat and mainly two-dimensional. However, their subsequent orientation in the folded three-dimensional embryo will be completely different. The dorsal structures of the folded embryo form from a circumscribed central ellipse of the early flat embryonic disc (see <a href="../B9780702077050000100/B9780702077050000100.xhtml#f0030">Fig. 10.5</a>). Lateral and ventral structures form from the remainder of the disc, and the peripheral edge of the disc eventually becomes constricted at the umbilicus (see <a href="../B9780702077050000100/B9780702077050000100.xhtml#f0050">Figs 10.9</a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000100/B9780702077050000100.xhtml#f0055">10.10</a>). Although the appearance of part of the epiblast is taken to specify the dorsal surface of the embryo, the inner layer, i.e. the hypoblast, is not, by default, a ventral embryonic structure.</div><div class="text" id="p0020">The primary, cephalocaudal, axis is conferred by the appearance of the primitive streak in the bilaminar disc. The primitive streak patterns cells during ingression, and so also specifies the dorsoventral axis, which becomes apparent after embryonic folding. The position of ingression through the streak confers axial, medial or lateral characteristics on the forming mesenchyme cells. The axial and medial populations remain as dorsal structures in the folded embryo, and the surface ectoderm above them will exhibit dorsal characteristics. The lateral plate mesenchyme will assume lateral and ventral positions after embryonic folding, and the surface ectoderm above this population will gain ventral characteristics. The third and last spatial axis is the bilateral, or laterolateral, axis, which appears as a consequence of the development of the other two axes. Initially, the right and left halves of the embryonic body are bilaterally symmetric. Lateral projections, the upper and lower limbs, develop in two places on each side of the body wall (somatopleure).</div><div class="text" id="p0025">With the last axis established, the temporal modification of the original embryonic axes can be seen. The segmental arrangement of the cephalocaudal axis is very obvious in the early embryo and is retained in many structures in adult life. Similarly, dorsal embryonic structures remain dorsal and undergo relatively little change. However, structures that were originally midline and ventral, especially those derived from splanchnopleuric mesenchyme, e.g. the cardiovascular system and the gastrointestinal tract and its adnexae, are subject to extensive shifts, and change from a bilaterally symmetric arrangement to an entire body that is now chiral, i.e. has distinct left and right sides.</div><div class="text" id="p0030">Organogenesis, the development of all the body organs and systems, begins after the dramatic events of gastrulation, when the embryo has attained a recognizable body plan. In human embryos, this corresponds to the end of stage 10 (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 12.1</span></a>). The head and tail folds are well formed, with enclosure of the foregut and hindgut (proenteron and metenteron), although the midgut (mesenteron) is only partly constricted from the yolk sac. The forebrain projection dominates the cranial end of the embryo, and the buccopharyngeal membrane and cardiac prominence are caudal and ventral to it. The cardiac prominence contains the transmedian pericardial cavity, which communicates dorsocaudally with right and left pericardioperitoneal canals. These pass dorsally to the transverse septum mesenchyme and open caudally into the extraembryonic coelom on each side of the midgut. The intraembryonic mesenchyme has begun to differentiate and the paraxial mesenchyme is being segmented into somites. Neural groove closure is progressing caudally, so that a neural tube is forming between the newly segmenting somites. Rostrally, the early brain regions, which have not yet fused, can be discerned. The neuroepithelium is separated from the dorsal aspect of the gut by the notochord. The earliest blood vessels have appeared and a primitive tubular heart occupies the pericardium. The chorionic circulation is soon to be established, after which the embryo rapidly becomes completely dependent on the maternal blood stream for its requirements. The embryo is connected to the developing placenta by a mesenchymal connecting stalk in which the umbilical vessels develop, and that also contains the allantois, a hindgut diverticulum. The lateral body walls are still widely separated. The embryo has contact with three different vesicles, namely, the amnion, which is in contact with the surface ectoderm; the yolk sac, which is in contact with the endoderm; and the chorionic cavity, containing the extraembryonic coelom, which is in contact with the intraembryonic coelomic lining (see <a href="../B9780702077050000100/B9780702077050000100.xhtml#f0055">Fig. 10.10</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000124/main.assets/f12-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 12.1</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, The embryo at stage 11, showing the position of the intraembryonic coelom (contained by the walls coloured blue). <span class="bold">B</span>, The three major epithelial populations within a stage 11 embryo, viewed from a ventrolateral position.

The boundaries between the segments are maintained by the differential expression of genes and proteins that restrict cell migration in these regions. Organogenetic processes either retain the segmental plan, e.g. spinal nerves, or replace it locally, e.g. the modifications of somatic intersegmental vessels by the development of longitudinal anastomoses. Anomalies may result from improper specification of segments along the cephalocaudal axis and may fail to produce the appropriately modified segmental plan.</div><div class="text" id="p0040">The degree to which vertebrate embryos are developmentally constrained at this period of development is controversial. Comparative studies on the timing at which specific embryonic structures appear, heterochrony, have shown that other embryonic species do not follow the same developmental sequence as humans (<a href="#bib4" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_4">Richardson and Keuck 2002</a>). Although some developmental mechanisms are highly conserved, e.g. the homeobox gene codes, others may have been dissociated and modified in different vertebrate species during evolution.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">Organogenesis, the further development of body regions and organs that is described in this Section, starts from about stage 10 (postfertilization days 28–29). Although it is both conventional and convenient to consider the further development of each body system on an individual basis, not only do all systems develop simultaneously, but also they interact and modify each other as they develop. This necessary interdependence is supported by the evidence of experimental embryology and reinforced by the phenomena of growth anomalies, which cut across the artificial boundaries of systems in most instances. For these reasons, it is recommended that the development of an individual system or body region should be studied in relation to others, especially those most closely associated with it, whether spatiotemporally or causally.</div></section><section><a id="s0015"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0025">Embryonic Cell Populations at the Start of Organogenesis</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0050">The developmental processes operating in the embryo between stages 5 and 9 enabled the construction of the bi- and trilaminar embryonic disc, the intraembryonic coelom and new proliferative epithelia. From the end of stage 10 a range of local epithelial and mesenchymal populations now interact to produce viscera and appendages. The inductive influences on these tissues and their repertoire of responses are very different from those seen at the onset of gastrulation. The range of tissues present at the start of organogenesis, when the body plan is clear, is given below (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 12.1</a>; <a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 12.2</span></a>).

Ectoderm over the dorsal region of the head and trunk is thin, as is the pericardial covering; this has been interpreted as a consequence of the expansion of this epithelium over structures that are enlarging rapidly as development proceeds. After the surface ectoderm has completed a number of early interactions it forms an upper layer, the periderm, which remains throughout fetal life, and a lower layer which differentiates into epidermis.</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0040">Ectodermal ring and ectodermal placodes</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0065">The ectoderm on the head and lateral borders of the embryo shows a zone of epithelial thickening, the ectodermal ring, which can be discerned from stage 10 and is completed by stage 12. Rostrally, it contains populations of neuroectoderm that remain in the ectoderm after primary neurulation and are termed ectodermal placodes. The latter may be considered to be neuroepithelial cells that remain within the surface ectoderm until central nervous system development has progressed sufficiently for their inclusion into sensory epithelia and cranial nerve ganglia. The neuronal placodes may either invaginate <span class="italic">in toto</span> to form a vesicle, or remain as a neuronal layer, or contribute individually to neuronal structures with cells of other origins. A midline ectodermal thickening, the adenohypophysial placode, invaginates as Rathke's pouch and forms a vesicle immediately rostral to the buccopharyngeal membrane. The ectodermal ring then passes bilaterally to encompass the olfactory and optic placodes, which give rise to the olfactory sensory epithelium and the lens of the eye, respectively. It then overlays the pharyngeal arches, where it gives rise to epibranchial placodes which remove themselves individually from the ectoderm at stage 10–11 and become associated with the neural crest cells within the cranial sensory ganglia supplying the arches. It also forms specializations of the ectoderm on the frontonasal, maxillary and mandibular processes, which give rise to the tooth buds and the outer coating of the teeth. The paired otic placodes overlying the rhombencephalon at the lateral portion of the second pharyngeal arch invaginate to form the otic vesicles, which give rise to the membranous labyrinth of the ear. The ectodermal ring then passes over the occipital and cervicothoracic parts of the embryo, superficial to the four occipital somites and later to the occipitocervical junction. Further caudally, it is associated with the upper limb field, where it will give rise to the apical ectodermal ridge. <a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_3">O'Rahilly and Müller (1985)</a> have called the portion of the ring between the upper and lower limbs the intermembral part. It overlies the underlying intraembryonic coelom, and later (between stages 12 and 13), the mesonephric duct and ridge. In stages 14–15 this portion of the ectodermal ring gives rise to the mammary line. In the unfolded embryo, caudal to the lower limb field, the ring passes distal to the cloacal membrane. In the folded embryo, this region becomes superior to the cloacal membrane and corresponds to the ectoderm associated with the external genitalia, particularly the genital tubercle and urogenital swellings, where it influences the internal and external descent of the testis and the formation of the inguinal canal.</div></section><section><a id="s0040"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0045">Neural ectoderm</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0070">The neuroepithelium at the time of primary neurulation is pseudostratified. It has a midline hinge region, which, with concomitant wedging of the cells in the lateral wall of the neural groove, promotes neural tube formation. The processes of the neuroepithelium abut on to internal and external limiting membranes. This epithelium proliferates to form all the cell lines of the central nervous system and, via the production of neural crest, all the cell lines of the peripheral nervous system.</div></section><section><a id="s0045"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0050">Notochord</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0075">During stage 10 the notochordal plate undergoes a process that is similar to, but a mirror image of, neurulation, and forms an epithelial tube from caudal to rostral, ending with the pharynx. The notochordal plate forms a deep groove, the vertical edges of the groove move medially and touch, and then the endodermal epithelium from each side fuses ventral to the notochord. The cells swell and develop an internal <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="203" id="pagebreak_203"/><a id="pg203"/>pressure (turgor) that confers rigidity on the notochord. The notochord is surrounded by a basal lamina, which is initially connected to a basement membrane, referred to as a perinotochordal sheath (<a href="#bib5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_5">Trapani et al 2017</a>); this term is subsequently applied to mesenchymal populations that surround the notochord. After stage 11 the tubular notochord is in contact with the neural tube dorsally and the endoderm ventrally. It is not a proliferative epithelium, but it has inductive effects on the overlying neural tube and the adjacent somites, and later provides a focus for sclerotomal migration.</div></section><section><a id="s0050"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0055">Endoderm</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0080">The craniocaudal progression of development means that the endoderm of the early stomodeum develops ahead of other portions of the endodermal epithelium.

The respiratory diverticulum arises slightly later, when the postpharyngeal gut may also be distinguished. The endoderm gives rise to the epithelial lining of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, the biliary system, and the urinary bladder and urethra.</div></section><section><a id="s0055"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0060">Coelomic epithelium</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0085">The coelomic epithelium lines the intraembryonic coelom, which is subdivided into a midline pericardial cavity, two bilateral pericardioperitoneal canals, and (initially bilateral) peritoneal cavities which are continuous with the extraembryonic coelom. The coelomic epithelium is a germinal epithelium. It produces the myocardium and connective tissue populations for the viscera, and gives rise to the supporting cells for the germ cells, the epithelial lining of the urogenital tracts, and the mesothelial lining of the pericardial, pleural and peritoneal cavities.</div></section><section><a id="s0060"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0065">Somites</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0090">Somites are discrete epithelial spheres formed by the transformation of paraxial mesoblast cells to epithelium once their migration is complete.

Like neural and coelomic epithelium, somatic epithelium produces cells destined for different fates, at different developmental times. Somites can be seen on each side of the fusing neural tube in the human embryo from stage 9.

The proportions of fibrous extracellular proteins (collagens) and the hydrophilic GAGs are important, because they confer turgidity and stiffness on developing tissues, open migration routes and provide ‘signposts’ for cellular interactions by facilitating the local deposition of growth factors (<a href="../B9780702077050000112/B9780702077050000112.xhtml">Ch. 11</a>) (<a href="#bib2" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_2">Loganathan et al 2016</a>).

The notochordal cells remain medially and the endodermal cells subsequently flatten and spread laterally. The population of cells that remain mesenchymal in contact with the floor of the neural groove, just rostral to the notochordal plate, is the prechordal mesenchyme (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 12.4</span></a>).

After neurulation, neural crest cells form a transient axial population and then disperse, in some cases migrating over considerable distances, to a variety of different developmental fates.

They provide mesenchyme cells that will produce the connective tissue in parts of the neuro- and viscerocrania: all cartilage, bone, ligament, tendon, dermal components and glandular stroma in the head; and contribute to the tunica media of the aortic arch arteries.</div></section><section><a id="s0095"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0100">Trunk neural crest</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0145">Unlike its counterpart in the head, trunk neural crest is formed as the neural tube closes rostrocaudally, which means that various stages of crest development can be found in the more caudal regions of an embryo. As the neural tube begins to fuse dorsally in the midline, the neural crest cells lose their epithelial characteristics and junctional connections, and form a band of loosely arranged mesenchyme cells immediately dorsal to the neural tube and beneath the ectoderm. Initially, most of the crest cells lie with their long axes perpendicular to the long axis of the neural tube. Later, the cell population expands laterally and around the neural tube as a sheet. Trunk neural crest cells move from their position dorsal to the neural tube via three routes: dorsolaterally, to form dorsal root ganglia throughout the trunk; ventrally, to form sympathetic ganglia, enteric nerves and the suprarenal medulla; and rostrocaudally, along the aorta, to form the pre-aortic ganglia (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0170">Fig. 14.6</a>). In a second migration route, crest cells pass dorsolaterally between the ectoderm and the epithelial plate of the somite into the somatopleure, where they eventually form melanocytes in the skin.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0100"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0105">Lateral plate</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0150">Lateral plate is the term for the early unsegmented mesoblast population lateral to the paraxial mesenchyme. Mesoblastic cells that arise from the middle of the primitive streak (primary mesenchyme) migrate cranially, laterally and caudally to reach their destinations, where they undergo mesenchymal to epithelial transformation to form a continuous layer subjacent to the ectoderm dorsally and the endoderm ventrally. The epithelium faces a new intraembryonic cavity, the intraembryonic coelom, which becomes confluent with the extraembryonic coelom and provides a route for the circulation of coelomic fluid through the embryo. Once formed, the intraembryonic coelomic wall becomes a proliferative epithelium that produces new populations of mesenchymal cells. The mesenchymal population subjacent to the ectoderm is termed somatopleuric mesenchyme, produced by the somatopleuric coelomic epithelium. The mesenchymal population surrounding the endoderm is termed splanchnopleuric mesenchyme, produced by the splanchnopleuric coelomic epithelium (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 12.2</a>).<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="206" id="pagebreak_206"/><a id="pg206"/></div><div class="text" id="p0155">It is important to note that these terms are relevant only caudal to the third pharyngeal arch. Rostral to this arch, there is a sparse mesenchymal population between the pharynx and the surface ectoderm prior to migration of the head neural crest, and there are no landmarks with which to demarcate lateral from paraxial mesenchyme. This unsplit lateral plate is believed to contribute to the cricoid and arytenoid cartilages, the tracheal rings and the associated connective tissue.</div><section><a id="s0105"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0110">Somatopleuric mesenchyme</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0160">Somatopleuric mesenchyme produces a mixed population of connective tissues and has a significant organizing effect at the level of the developing limbs. The pattern of limb development is controlled by information contained in the somatopleuric mesenchyme. Regions of the limb are specified by interaction between the surface ectoderm (apical ectodermal ridge) and underlying somatopleuric mesenchyme and together these tissues form the progress zone of the limb. The somatopleuric mesenchyme in the limb bud also specifies the postaxial border of the developing limb. Somatopleuric mesenchyme gives rise to the connective tissue elements of the appendicular skeleton, including the bones, cartilages and associated ligaments and tendons of the pectoral and pelvic girdles and the limbs. It also gives rise to the dermis of the skin of the ventral and lateral body walls and of the limbs.</div></section><section><a id="s0110"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0115">Splanchnopleuric mesenchyme</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0165">Splanchnopleuric mesenchyme surrounds the developing gut and respiratory tubes, contributing connective tissue cells to the lamina propria and submucosa, and smooth muscle cells to the muscularis mucosae and muscularis externa. It plays a patterning role in endodermal development, specifying the region and villus type in the gut, and the branching pattern in the respiratory tract.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0115"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0120">Intermediate mesenchyme</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0170">Intermediate mesenchyme is a loose collection of cells found between the somites and the lateral plate (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 12.2</a>). Its development is closely related to the progress of differentiation of the somites and the proliferating coelomic epithelium from which it is derived. Intermediate mesenchyme is not present before somitogenesis or the formation of the eighth somite. In embryos with 8–10 somites, it is present lateral to the sixth somite but does not extend cranially. The mesenchyme cells are arranged as layers, one continuous with the dorsal side of the paraxial mesenchyme and the somatopleure, the other with the ventral side of the paraxial mesenchyme and the splanchnopleure.</div><div class="text" id="p0175">As development proceeds, the intermediate mesenchyme forms a loosely packed dorsolateral cord of cells that lengthens at the caudal end and ultimately joins the cloaca: it gives rise to the nephric system, gonads and reproductive ducts.</div></section><section><a id="s0120"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0125">Angioblastic mesenchyme</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0180">Mesenchymal cells that give rise to the cellular elements of the blood, the endothelium and the mesenchymal layers of the tunica externa and tunica adventitia of blood and lymphatic vessels, arise initially from extraembryonic and later from intraembryonic sources. Evidence suggests that endodermal tissues are necessary for endothelial differentiation, particularly in the early foregut. Angioblastic mesenchyme forms early in postfertilization week 3 from extraembryonic mesenchyme in the splanchnopleure of the yolk sac, in the body stalk (containing the allantois), and in the somatopleure of the chorion. Later, contiguous islands merge, forming a continuous network of fine vessels. Intraembryonic blood vessels are first seen at the endoderm–mesenchyme interface within the lateral splanchnic mesenchyme at the caudolateral margins of the cranial intestinal portal. Angioblastic competence has been demonstrated within the ventral (splanchnopleuric) mesenchyme with which the endoderm interacts. The notochord and prechordal plate do not contain angiogenic cells and ectodermal tissues do not appear to give rise to angiogenic cells. Somites, derived from paraxial mesenchyme, have been shown to be a source of angioblasts that either differentiate with the somite derivatives, or migrate to the neural tube, ventrolateral body wall, limb buds, mesonephros and the dorsal part of the aorta.</div><div class="text" id="p0185">The earliest angiogenic mesenchymal cells form blood vessels by vasculogenesis, a process in which new vessels (e.g. endothelial heart tubes, dorsal aortae, umbilical and early vitelline vessels) develop <span class="italic">in situ</span> (<a href="../B9780702077050000136/B9780702077050000136.xhtml">Ch. 13</a>). Later vessels develop by angiogenesis, sprouting and branching from the endothelium of pre-existing vessels; this process is the means by which most other vessels develop. The ultimate pattern of vessels is controlled by the surrounding non-angiogenic mesenchyme: vessels become morphologically specific for the organ in which they develop, and immunologically specific, expressing organ-specific proteins. Blood cells also arise from extraembryonic tissues of the secondary yolk sac, with three overlapping waves of production as intraembryonic regions become seeded with haemopoietic stem cell precursors (<a href="../B9780702077050000136/B9780702077050000136.xhtml">Ch. 13</a>). They are not derived from the same precursor populations that produce blood and lymphatic vessels.</div></section></section></section></section></section><footer><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebib0010"/><h2 class="reftitle" id="cesectitle5560">References</h2><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebibsec0010"/><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib1"><!--<a hreef="#bib_1">1</a>. --><a id="ref0020"/><a href="#bib_1">Hadden</a> W.J, Young J.L, Holle A.W, et al. <cite>Stem cell migration and mechanotransduction on linear stiffness gradient hydrogels</cite>. <cite><i>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</i></cite>. 2017;114:5647–5652.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib2"><!--<a hreef="#bib_2">2</a>. --><a id="ref0025"/><a href="#bib_2">Loganathan</a> R, Rongish B.J, Smith C.M, et al. <cite>Extracellular matrix motion and early morphogenesis</cite>. <cite><i>Development</i></cite>. 2016;143:2056–2065.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib3"><!--<a hreef="#bib_3">3</a>. --><a id="ref0030"/><a href="#bib_3">O’Rahilly</a> R, Müller F. <cite>The origin of the ectodermal ring in staged human embryos of the first 5 weeks</cite>. <cite><i>Acta Anat</i></cite>. 1985;122:145–157.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib4"><!--<a hreef="#bib_4">4</a>. --><a id="ref0035"/><a href="#bib_4">Richardson</a> M.K, Keuck G. <cite>Haeckel’s ABC of evolution and development</cite>. <cite><i>Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc</i></cite>. 2002;77:495–528.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib5"><!--<a hreef="#bib_5">5</a>. --><a id="ref0040"/><a href="#bib_5">Trapani</a> V, Bonaldo P, Corallo D. <cite>Role of the ECM in notochord formation, function and disease</cite>. <cite><i>J Cell Sci</i></cite>. 2017;130:3203–3211.</p></section></section></footer></section></body></html>
