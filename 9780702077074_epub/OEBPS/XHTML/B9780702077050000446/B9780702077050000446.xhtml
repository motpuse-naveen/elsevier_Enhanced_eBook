The walls of each orbit protect the eye from injury, provide points of attachment for six extraocular muscles that allow the accurate positioning of the visual axis, and determine the spatial relationship between the two eyes, which is essential for both binocular vision and conjugate eye movements.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">By convention, each cavity is considered to approximate to a quadrilateral pyramid with its base at the orbital opening, narrowing to its apex along a posteromedially directed axis. Each orbit has a roof, floor and medial and lateral walls. The medial walls lie approximately 25<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm apart in adults and are nearly parallel. The angle between the medial and lateral walls is about 45°. The compromise between protection and ensuring a good field of view dictates that each eyeball is located anteriorly within the orbit. The eyeball thus occupies only one-fifth of the volume of the orbit (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 44.1</span></a>); the remainder of the cavity is filled with extraocular muscles, vessels and nerves that are contained within and supported by orbital fat and connective tissue. In brief, the orbit transmits the optic, oculomotor, trochlear and abducens nerves, branches of the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve and the ophthalmic vessels. The ciliary parasympathetic ganglion is located towards the rear of the orbit, lateral to the optic nerve and medial to lateral rectus. The orbit also contains components of the lacrimal system, which is responsible for the production and drainage of tears.</div><section><a id="sf0010"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000446/main.assets/f44-01a-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000446/main.assets/f44-01b-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 44.1</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, A T2-weighted axial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan through the mid-orbit. <span class="bold">B</span>, Note the optic nerve in its entirety. <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Dr Timothy Beale FRCR, Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital, London.</span></figcaption></figure></div></section><div class="text" id="p0020">There is a strong correlation between the pattern of orbital growth and eyeball growth.

Anteromedially, it contains the frontal sinus and displays a small trochlear fovea, sometimes surmounted by a small spine, where the cartilaginous trochlea (pulley) for superior oblique is attached. Anterolaterally, there is a shallow fossa that houses the orbital part of the lacrimal gland.

This paper-thin, rectangular plate covers the middle and posterior ethmoidal air cells, providing a route by which infection can spread into the orbit. The ethmoid articulates with the medial edge of the orbital plate of the frontal bone at a suture that is interrupted by anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina. Posteriorly, it articulates with the body of the sphenoid, which forms the medial wall of the orbit to its apex. The lacrimal bone lies anterior to the ethmoid; it contains a fossa for the nasolacrimal sac that is limited in front by the anterior lacrimal crest on the frontal process of the maxilla and behind by the posterior lacrimal crest of the lacrimal bone (to which the lacrimal part of orbicularis oculi and lacrimal fascia are attached). A descending process of the lacrimal bone at the lower end of the posterior lacrimal crest contributes to the formation of the upper part of the nasolacrimal canal, which is completed by the maxilla (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 44.3</span></a>). During development, the medial wall of the orbit doubles in length, with disproportionate enlargement of its anterior half. Growth is rapid during the first 6 years of life and gradual between 7 years and adulthood (<a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_28">Isaacson and Monge 2003</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0020"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000446/main.assets/f44-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0020"/><a id="fspara0020"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 44.3</span> A horizontal section through the floor of the left orbit and the adjacent ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinuses, viewed from above.</figcaption></figure></div></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0035">Floor</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0035">The floor of the orbit is mostly formed by the orbital plate of the maxilla, which articulates with the zygomatic bone anterolaterally and the small triangular orbital process of the palatine bone posteromedially (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 44.3</a>). The floor is thin and forms most of the roof of the maxillary sinus. Not quite horizontal, it ascends a little laterally. Anteriorly, it curves into the lateral wall, and posteriorly, it is separated from the lateral wall by the inferior orbital fissure, which connects the orbit posteriorly to the pterygopalatine fossa, and more anteriorly to the infratemporal fossa. The medial lip is notched by the infraorbital groove. The latter passes forwards and sinks into the floor to become the infraorbital canal, which opens on the face at the infraorbital foramen; the infraorbital groove, canal and foramen contain the infraorbital nerve and vessels. Proportionally more pure orbital fractures involve the floor, particularly in the region of the infraorbital groove (<a href="#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_8">Burm et al 1999</a>). The classic ‘blowout fracture’ leaves the orbital rim intact and typically entraps soft tissue structures, leading to diplopia, impaired ocular motility and enophthalmos; infraorbital nerve involvement leads to ipsilateral sensory disturbance of the skin of the midface.</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0040">Lateral wall</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0040">The lateral wall of the orbit is formed by the orbital surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid posteriorly and the frontal process of the zygomatic bone anteriorly; the bones meet at the sphenozygomatic suture. The <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="770" id="pagebreak_770"/><a id="pg770"/>zygomatic surface contains the openings of minute canals for the zygomaticofacial and zygomaticotemporal nerves, the former near the junction of the floor and lateral wall, and the latter at a slightly higher level, sometimes near the suture. The orbital tubercle, to which the lateral palpebral ligament, the check ligament of lateral rectus and the aponeurosis of levator palpebrae are all attached, lies just inside the midpoint of the lateral orbital margin. The lateral wall is the thickest wall of the orbit, especially posteriorly, where it separates the orbit from the middle cranial fossa. Anteriorly, the lateral wall separates the orbit and the infratemporal fossa. The lateral wall and roof are continuous anteriorly but are separated posteriorly by the superior orbital fissure, which lies between the greater wing (below) and lesser wing (above) of the sphenoid, and communicates with the middle cranial fossa. The fissure tapers laterally but widens at its medial end, its long axis descending posteromedially. Where the fissure begins to widen, its inferolateral edge shows a projection, often a spine, for the lateral attachment of the common tendinous ring (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 44.4</a>). An inferior orbital fissure, which runs from the superolateral end of the superior orbital fissure towards the orbital floor, is sometimes associated with an anastomosis between the middle meningeal and infraorbital arteries.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0040"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0045">Orbital fissures and foramina</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0050">Optic canal</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0045"/><div class="textfl" id="p0045">The lesser wing of the sphenoid is connected to the body of the sphenoid by a thin, flat anterior root and a thick, triangular posterior root.

The maxilla and sphenoid often meet at the anterior end of the fissure, excluding the zygomatic bone. The inferior orbital fissure connects the orbit with the pterygopalatine and infratemporal fossae and transmits the infraorbital and zygomatic branches of the maxillary nerve and accompanying vessels (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 44.4</a>), orbital rami from the pterygopalatine ganglion and a connection between the inferior ophthalmic vein and pterygoid venous plexus.

These foramina usually lie close to the superior orbital fissure, either in the frontal bone, or the greater wing of the sphenoid, or along the frontosphenoidal suture. They typically transmit the meningolacrimal artery (an orbital branch of the middle meningeal artery that supplies the lacrimal gland), but may also also transmit the anastomosis between the recurrent branch of the lacrimal artery and the middle meningeal artery.

The optic nerve and ophthalmic artery enter the orbit via the optic canal, and so lie within the common tendinous ring.

The trochlear nerve and the frontal and lacrimal branches of the ophthalmic nerve all enter the orbit through the superior orbital fissure but lie outside the common tendinous ring. Structures that enter the orbit through the inferior orbital fissure lie outside the common tendinous ring. The close anatomical relationship of the optic nerve and other cranial nerves at the orbital apex means that lesions in this region may lead to a combination of visual loss from optic neuropathy and ophthalmoplegia from multiple cranial nerve involvement (<a href="#bib72" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_72">Yeh and Foroozan 2004</a>).</div><section><a id="sf0025"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0025"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000446/main.assets/f44-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0025"/><a id="fspara0025"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 44.4</span> The common tendinous ring: muscle origins have been superimposed.

The sheath of superior oblique reaches the fibrous pulley (trochlea) associated with the muscle. The sheaths of the four recti are very thick anteriorly but are reduced posteriorly to a delicate perimysium. Just before they blend with the fascia bulbi, the thick sheaths of adjacent recti become confluent and form a fascial ring.</div><div class="text" id="p0130">Expansions from the muscular fascia are important for the attachments they make. Those from the medial and lateral recti are triangular and strong, and are attached to the lacrimal and zygomatic bones, respectively; since they may limit the actions of the two recti, they are termed the medial and lateral check ligaments (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 44.6</a>). Other extraocular muscles have less substantial check ligaments, and the capacity of any of them actually to limit movement has been questioned.</div><div class="text" id="p0135">The sheath of inferior rectus is thickened on its underside and blends with the sheath of inferior oblique. These two, in turn, are continuous with the fascial ring noted earlier and therefore with the sheaths of the medial and lateral recti. Since the latter are attached to the orbital walls by check ligaments, a continuous fascial band, the suspensory ligament of the eye, is slung like a hammock below the eye, providing sufficient support such that, even when the maxilla (forming the floor of the orbit) is removed, the eye will retain its position.</div><div class="text" id="p0140">The thickened fused sheath of inferior rectus and inferior oblique also has an anterior expansion into the lower eyelid, where, augmented by some fibres of orbicularis oculi, it attaches to the inferior tarsus as the inferior tarsal muscle; contraction of inferior rectus in downward gaze therefore also draws the lid downward. The sheath of levator palpebrae superioris is also thickened anteriorly, and just behind the aponeurosis it fuses inferiorly with the sheath of superior rectus. It extends forwards between the two muscles and attaches to the upper fornix of the conjunctiva.</div><div class="text" id="p0145">Other extensions of the fascia bulbi pass medially and laterally, and attach to the orbital walls, forming the transverse ligament of the eye. This structure is of uncertain significance, but presumably plays a part in drawing the fornix upwards in gaze elevation and may act as a fulcrum for levator movements. Other numerous finer fasciae form radial septa that extend from the fascia bulbi and the muscle sheaths to the periosteum of the orbit, and so provide compartments for orbital fat (<a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">Koornneef 1977</a>). They also prevent the gross displacement of orbital fat, which could interfere with the accurate positioning of the two eyes that is essential for binocular vision.</div><div class="text" id="p0150">The periosteum of the orbit is only loosely attached to bone. Behind, it is united with the dura mater surrounding the optic nerve and, in front, it is continuous with the periosteum of the orbital margin, where it gives off a stratum that contributes to the orbital septum. It also attaches to the trochlea and, as the lacrimal fascia, forms the roof and lateral wall of the fossa for the nasolacrimal sac.</div><section><a id="s0095"/><section><a id="s9095"/><h4 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0095">Orbital connective tissue pulleys</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0155">There is mounting evidence that challenges the traditional view that the recti are attached only at their origin and scleral insertion. The concept that orbital connective tissue sheaths elastically coupled to the orbital walls function as pulleys was initially proposed as an explanation for the observed orbital stability of rectus muscle paths (<a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_44">Miller 1989</a>). Each pulley consists of an encircling sleeve of collagen located within the fascia bulbi, near the equator of the globe. Elastic fibres and bundles of smooth muscle confer the required internal rigidity to the structure (<a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Demer 2002</a>). Although the original model described a passive pulley system, the current view is that fibres from the orbital surface of the muscle insert into the pulley sleeve to allow small longitudinal movements. This ‘active pulley hypothesis’ provides a better explanation for normal ocular kinematics (<a href="#bib45" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Miller 2007</a>, <a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Guo et al 2016</a>).</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0100"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0100">Orbital fat</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0160">The spaces between the main structures of the orbit are occupied by fat, particularly in the region between the optic nerve and the surrounding cone of muscles (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 44.5</a>; <a href="#f0050"><span class="bold">Fig. 44.7</span></a>).

Levator palpebrae superioris is an elevator of the upper eyelid, and the other six, i.e. four recti (superior, inferior, medial and lateral) and two obliques (superior and inferior), are capable of moving the eye in almost any direction.

It has a short narrow tendon at its posterior attachment and broadens gradually, then more sharply as it passes anteriorly above the eyeball. The muscle ends in front in a wide aponeurosis. Some of its tendinous fibres pass straight into the upper eyelid to attach to the anterior surface of the tarsus, while the rest radiate and pierce orbicularis oculi to pass to the skin of the upper eyelid. A thin lamina of smooth muscle, the superior tarsal muscle, passes from the underside of levator palpebrae superioris to the upper margin of the superior tarsus (see <a href="#f0120">Fig. 44.20</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0185">The connective tissue sheaths of the adjoining surfaces of levator palpebrae superioris and superior rectus are fused (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 44.5</a>). Where the two muscles separate to reach their anterior attachments, the fascia between them forms a thick mass to which the superior conjunctival fornix is attached; this is usually described as an additional attachment of levator palpebrae superioris. Traced laterally, the aponeurosis of the levator passes between the orbital and palpebral parts of the lacrimal gland to attach to the orbital tubercle of the zygomatic bone. Medially, it loses its tendinous nature as it passes closely over the reflected tendon of superior oblique, and continues on to the medial palpebral ligament as loose strands of connective tissue.</div><section><a id="s0135"/><section><a id="s0120"/><section><a id="s0125"/><section><a id="s0130"/><section><a id="s9135"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0115">Vascular supply</p><div class="textfl" id="p0190">Levator palpebrae superioris receives its arterial supply both directly from the ophthalmic artery and indirectly from its supraorbital branch.</div></section><section><a id="s0140"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0120">Innervation</p><div class="textfl" id="p0195">Levator palpebrae superioris is innervated by a branch of the superior division of the oculomotor nerve that enters the inferior surface of the muscle.

Elevation of the eyelid is opposed by the palpebral part of orbicularis oculi. Levator palpebrae superioris is linked to superior rectus by a check ligament, and so the upper eyelid elevates when the gaze of the eye is directed upwards.</div><div class="text" id="p0205">The position of the eyelids depends on reciprocal tone in orbicularis oculi and levator palpebrae superioris, and on the degree of ocular protrusion. In the opened position, the upper eyelid covers the upper part of the cornea, while the lower lid lies just below its lower margin. The eyes are closed by movements of both lids, produced by the contraction of the palpebral part of orbicularis oculi and relaxation of levator palpebrae superioris. In looking upwards, the levator contracts and the upper lid follows the ocular movement. At the same time, the eyebrows are usually raised by the frontal parts of occipitofrontalis to diminish their overhang. The lower lid lags behind ocular movement, so that more sclera is exposed below the cornea and the lid is bulged a little by the lower part of the elevated eye. When the eye is depressed, both lids move; the upper retains its normal relation to the eyeball and still covers about a quarter of the cornea, whereas the lower lid is depressed because the extension of the thickened fascia of inferior rectus and inferior oblique pull on its tarsus as the former contracts.</div><div class="text" id="p0210">The palpebral apertures are widened in states of fear or excitement by contraction of the superior and inferior tarsal muscles as a result of increased sympathetic activity.

In bright sunshine, the latter can be reduced by lowering the upper lid, so limiting glare. The role of the superior tarsal muscle is less clear. Its tonus is related to sympathetic activity, and since ptosis is a consequence of impairment of its sympathetic nerve supply, it may function as an accessory elevator of the upper eyelid.</div><div class="text" id="p0360">Six extraocular muscles rotate the eyeball in directions that depend on the geometrical relation between their bony and global (scleral) attachments (<a href="#f0070"><span class="bold">Fig. 44.10</span></a>), which are altered by the ocular movements themselves. For convenience, each muscle will be considered in isolation, but it must be appreciated that any movement of the eyeball alters the tension and/or length in all six muscles. It is useful to consider the four recti and two obliques as separate groups (remembering always that they act in concert) because they form more obvious groupings as antagonists or synergists. The extrinsic ocular muscles collectively position the eyeball in the orbital cavity and prevent its anteroposterior movements, other than a slight retraction during blinks, because the recti exert a posterior traction while the obliques pull the eyeball to some degree anteriorly.

Being approximately horizontal, when the visual axis is in its primary position, i.e. directed to the horizon, they rotate the eye medially (adduction) or laterally (abduction) about an imaginary vertical axis. They are antagonists. The visual axis can be swept through a horizontal arc by reciprocal adjustment of their lengths. When, as is usual, both eyes are involved, the medial and lateral recti of each eye either can adjust both visual axes in a conjugate movement from point to point at infinity (their axes remaining parallel), or they can converge or diverge the axes to or from nearer or more distant objects of attention in the visual field.</div><div class="text" id="p0370">The medial and lateral recti do not rotate the eye around its horizontal axis and so cannot elevate or depress the visual axes as gaze is transferred from nearer to more distant objects or the reverse. This movement requires the superior and inferior recti (aided by the two oblique muscles). It is important to remember that the orbital axis does not correspond with the visual axis in its primary position but diverges from it at an angle of approximately 23° (<a href="#f0070"><span class="bold">Fig. 44.10A</span></a>) (the value varies between individuals, and depends on the angle between the orbital axes and the median plane). Thus, the simple rotation caused by an isolated superior rectus, analysed with reference to the three hypothetical ocular axes, appears more complex, being primarily elevation (horizontal axis), and secondarily a less powerful medial rotation (vertical axis) and slight intorsion (anteroposterior axis) in which the midpoint of the upper rim of the cornea (often referred to as ‘12 o’clock’) is rotated medially. These actions, compounded as a single, simple rotation, are easily appreciated when it is seen that the direction of traction of superior rectus runs in a posteromedial direction from its attachment in front, which is anterior to the equator and superior to the cornea, to its bony attachment near the orbital apex (see <a href="#f0070">Fig. 44.10</a>). Inferior rectus pulls in a similar direction to superior rectus but rotates the visual axis downwards about the horizontal axis. It rotates the eye medially on a vertical axis but its action around the anteroposterior axis extorts the eye, i.e. rotates it so that the corneal ‘12 o’clock’ point turns laterally. The combined, equal contractions of the superior and inferior recti therefore rotate the eyeball medially, since their effects around the horizontal and anteroposterior axes are opposed. In binocular movements, they assist the medial recti in converging the visual axes, and by reciprocal adjustment can elevate or depress the visual axes. As the eyeball is rotated laterally, the lines of traction of the superior and inferior recti approach the plane of the anteroposterior ocular axis (see <a href="#f0070">Fig. 44.10</a>), and so their rotational effects about this and the vertical ocular axis diminish. In abduction to approximately 23°, they become almost purely an elevator and depressor, respectively, of the visual axis.</div><div class="text" id="p0375">Superior oblique acts on the eye from the trochlea and, since the attachment of inferior oblique is, for practical purposes, vertically below this, both muscles approach the eyeball at the same angle, being attached in approximately similar positions in the superior and inferior posterolateral ocular quadrants (see <a href="#f0070">Fig. 44.10</a>). Superior oblique elevates the posterior aspect of the eyeball, and inferior oblique depresses it, which means that the former rotates the visual axis downwards and the latter rotates it upwards, and both movements occur around the horizontal axis. When the eye is in the primary position, the obliquity of both muscles means that they pull in a direction posterior to the vertical axis and both therefore rotate the eye laterally around this axis. With regard to the anteroposterior axis, in isolation, superior oblique intorts the eye and inferior oblique extorts it. Like the superior and inferior recti, therefore, the two obliques have a common turning movement around the vertical axis but are opposed forces in respect of the other two. Acting in concert, they could therefore assist the lateral rectus in abducting the visual axis, as in divergence of the eyes in transferring attention from near to far. Again, like the superior and inferior recti, the directions of traction of the oblique muscles also vary with ocular position, such that they become more nearly a pure elevator and a depressor as the eye is adducted.</div><div class="text" id="p0380">Ocular rotations are, for the most part, under voluntary control, whereas torsional movements cannot be initiated at will. When the head is tilted in a frontal plane, reflex torsions occur. Any small lapse in the concerted adjustment of both eyes produces diplopia.</div></section><section><a id="s0365"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0275">Movements that shift or stabilize gaze</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0385">The role of eye movements is to bring the image of objects of visual interest on to the fovea of the retina and to hold the image steady in order to achieve the highest level of visual acuity. Several types of eye movement are required to ensure that these conditions are met. Moreover, the movements of both eyes must be near perfectly matched to achieve the benefits of binocularity. Both voluntary and reflex movements are involved and may be so classified. Alternatively, they may be grouped into those movements that shift gaze as visual interest changes, and those that stabilize gaze by maintaining a steady image on the retina. They have distinct characteristics, and are generated by different neural mechanisms in response to different stimuli, but share a common final motor pathway. Movements that shift or stabilize gaze include saccades, vergence, pursuit and vestibular-generated reflexes (<a href="#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_38">Leigh and Zee 2015</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0390">Saccadic activity is almost omnipresent in human vision. Thus, both visual axes are endlessly and rapidly transferred to new points of interest in any part of the visual field. Binocular gaze is frequently made to travel routes of the most variable complexity in examining objects of interest in the field, and both visual axes must be maintained with sufficient accuracy to avoid diplopia. In so-called ‘fixation’ of a focus of attention, whether uniocular or binocular, the visual axis is not ‘fixed’ in a perfectly steady manner but undergoes minute, but measurable, flicking (of a few minutes or even seconds of arc) across the true line of fixation. These microsaccades are rapid and surprisingly complex. When interest changes to another feature of the visual scene, the eyes execute a fast or saccadic movement to take up fixation. If the required rotation is small, the saccade is accurate, whereas small supplementary corrective saccades are needed if the shift is substantial. Saccades may also occur in response to other, i.e. non-visual, exteroceptive stimuli (e.g. auditory, tactile or centrally evoked). They may be volitional or reflex. As an example of the latter, in reading a line of print, the eyes make three or four jerky saccades rather than following the line smoothly; the line is usefully imaged only when the eye is stationary, which means that little of the line is seen by the centre of the fovea. In general, reaction times and movements are measured in microseconds, amplitude varies from seconds of arc to many degrees, with an accuracy of 0.2° or better, and the velocity of a large saccade may reach 500° sec<sup><span>−</span>1</sup>. The speed of saccades is assured by an initial, slightly excessive, contraction of the appropriate muscles to overcome orbital viscous resistance. The necessary deceleration when the target is fixated is largely dependent on the elasticity of the extraocular muscles and orbital soft tissues, and not on antagonistic muscular activity.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="776" id="pagebreak_776"/><a id="pg776"/></div><div class="text" id="p0395">Vergence is a relatively slow movement permitting maintenance of single binocular vision of close objects. The eyes converge towards the midline between the two eyes to achieve imagery of the object on both foveas. The view of the object at the two eyes is not quite the same and the disparity is used to assess depth. In addition, the pupils constrict and the eyes accommodate to achieve sharp, focused images. These three activities constitute the near reflex (<a href="../B9780702077050000458/B9780702077050000458.xhtml">Ch. 45</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0400">Pursuit eye movements are used to track a moving object of visual interest, maintaining the image approximately on the fovea. They are usually preceded by a saccade to capture the image but, unlike saccades, pursuit movements are slow and motivated by vision. If the angular shift required to track a moving object is large or the object is moving swiftly, the initial saccade is frequently inaccurate and one or more small corrective saccades are made before tracking begins. Because the stimulus is visual, the pursuit system response is subject to a relatively long latency (approximately 100<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>msec); the limitation in performance this imposes may be offset by a predictive capacity when object movement follows a regular pattern, and the eye movements adjust in anticipation of the speed and direction of the object. Smooth pursuit performance declines with age and is commonly impaired in cerebellar disease.</div><div class="text" id="p0405">The vestibular apparatus induces a variety of reflex eye movements to compensate for the potentially disruptive effects on vision caused by head and body movement (<a href="../B9780702077050000434/B9780702077050000434.xhtml">Ch. 43</a>). Receptors in the semicircular canals respond to active or passive rotational (angular) accelerations of the head. When the body makes substantial rotational movements, a vestibulo-ocular reflex generates a cycle of responses involving both the shifting and stabilizing of gaze. Body rotation is matched by counter-rotation of the eyes so that gaze direction is unaltered and clear vision is maintained. Physical constraint limits the rotation to 30° or less and is followed by a rapid saccadic movement of the eyes to another object in the visual scene and the cycle is repeated. Vision is therefore clear throughout most of the cycle while the image is stationary, but at the cost of no useful vision during the brief periods of the saccades. The reflex is efficient and rapid; this speed could not be generated by the visual system, which is slow relative to the short latency of vestibular receptors.</div><div class="text" id="p0410">Other reflexes generated by the vestibular system, which induce compensatory eye movements to stabilize gaze, are activated during brief head movements. When the head is sharply rotated in any direction, the eyeball rotates by an equal amount in the opposite direction in response to the stimulation of semicircular canal cristae (angular acceleration), and gaze is undisturbed. Brief rotational movements are commonly combined with translational movements (linear acceleration) that are monitored by otolith organs. For example, a linear displacement occurs in walking as the head bobs vertically with each stride, and a rotational displacement occurs as the head rolls, invoking otolith and canal responses, respectively, to stabilize the retinal image. Vestibular disease incurring the loss of the rapid, fine compensatory eye movements in locomotion destabilizes the retinal image, blurs vision and may render locomotion intolerable.</div><div class="text" id="p0415">The otoliths also respond to the pull of gravity, generating static vestibulo-ocular reflexes associated with head tilt. When static otolith orientation is changed, e.g. when the head is tilted upwards or downwards, the eyes counter-rotate to maintain fixation of the horizontal meridian. Lateral tilt towards a shoulder generates a torsional counter-rotation equal and in opposite direction by the two eyes, a movement that cannot be made voluntarily: because the foveal image is unaffected by torsional movements, there is no visual penalty.</div><div class="text" id="p0420">The optokinetic response is another visually mediated reflex that stabilizes retinal imagery when a visual scene is rotated about a stationary subject. As the scene changes, the eyes follow and hold the retinal image steady until the eyes shift rapidly in the opposite direction to another area of the visual scene. The stimulus is the full field of vision, rather than small objects within it, and the alternating slow and fast phases of movement that are generated describe optokinetic nystagmus. This reflex functions in collaboration with the rotational vestibulo-ocular reflex. In sustained rotations of the body, the vestibulo-ocular reflex fades because of the mechanical arrangements of the semicircular canals. In darkness, the reflex, which is initially compensatory, loses velocity, and after approximately 45 seconds the eyes become stationary. With a visual input, the reflex is sustained by the optokinetic response, and because the reflex is already initiated, the relative delay of visual input is overcome. The usual method of evoking optokinetic nystagmus in the laboratory or clinic is to present a horizontally moving pattern of vertical black-on-white stripes while the head of the subject is held stationary.</div></section><section><a id="s0370"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0280">Neural control of gaze</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0425">Although the detailed anatomical substrates for the different types of eye movement differ, they share common neural circuitry that lies mainly in the pons and midbrain, for horizontal and vertical gaze movements, respectively (<a href="#f0080"><span class="bold">Fig. 44.12</span></a>). The common element for all types of horizontal gaze movements is the abducens nucleus. It contains motor neurones that innervate the ipsilateral lateral rectus and interneurones that project via the medial longitudinal fasciculus to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus, which controls medial rectus. A lesion of the abducens nucleus leads to a total loss of ipsilateral horizontal conjugate gaze. A lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus produces slowed or absent adduction of the ipsilateral eye, usually associated with jerky movements (nystagmus) of the contralateral abducting eye, a syndrome called internuclear ophthalmoplegia (<a href="#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Leigh and Zee 2015</a>). The gaze motor command involves specialized areas of the reticular formation of the brainstem, which receive a variety of supranuclear inputs. The main region for the generation of horizontal saccades is the paramedian pontine reticular formation, located on each side of the midline in the central paramedian part of the tegmentum, and extending from the pontomedullary junction to the pontopeduncular junction. Each paramedian pontine reticular formation contains excitatory neurones (referred to as ‘burst’ neurones) that discharge at high frequencies just prior to and during ipsilateral saccades. Excitatory burst neurones make monosynaptic connections with the ipsilateral abducens nucleus. Omnipause neurones in the pontine nucleus raphe interpositus, located in the midline between the rootlets of the abducens nerves, discharge tonically during fixation but stop firing immediately prior to a saccade. They appear to exert an inhibitory influence on the burst neurones and act as a switch to change from fixation to saccadic mode (<a href="#bib54" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_54">Ramat et al 2007</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0080"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000446/main.assets/f44-12-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0050"/><a id="fspara0050"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 44.12</span> A summary of the control of eye movements.

The diagram on the left shows the brainstem pathways for horizontal gaze. Axons from the PPRF travel to the ipsilateral abducens nucleus innervating lateral rectus (LR).

These forces tend to move the eyeball back to looking straight ahead, i.e. the primary position, after a saccade. Vestibular nuclei and the perihypoglossal complex project directly to the abducens nuclei: these projections probably also carry smooth pursuit signals, via the cerebellum.</div><div class="text" id="p0440">The final common pathway for vertical gaze movements is formed by the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei. The rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus contains both excitatory burst neurones that discharge in relation to up-and-down vertical saccadic movements and project to motor neurones involved in vertical gaze, and omnipause neurones that act similarly to those for horizontal gaze. The rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus projects through the posterior commissure to its equivalent on the other side of the mesencephalon for upgaze, as well as directly to the ipsilateral <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="778" id="pagebreak_778"/><a id="pg778"/>oculomotor and trochlear nuclei for downgaze (see <a href="#f0080">Fig. 44.12</a>). Neurones in and around the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, which lies slightly caudal to the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, provide signals for vertical gaze holding. Vertical gaze palsies can affect upgaze, downgaze or both. Lesions within the posterior commissure predominantly give rise to disturbances in upgaze, associated with other signs of dorsal midbrain syndrome, e.g. pupillary abnormalities (light–near dissociation). Discrete lesions placed more ventrally in the region of the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus may cause mixed up-and-down, or mainly downgaze disturbances (<a href="#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Leigh and Zee 2015</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0445">The cerebellum and cerebral hemispheres play important roles in the control of eye movements. The vestibulocerebellum (flocculus and nodule) is involved in gaze holding, smooth pursuit and the vestibulo-ocular reflex (<a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X.xhtml#c0029">Ch. 29</a>). The dorsal vermis and fastigial nucleus are involved in programming accurate saccades and smooth pursuit. The cerebral hemispheres are also involved in the programming and coordination of saccadic and pursuit conjugate eye movements. The frontal eye field, the supplementary eye field, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the parietal eye field are all involved in eye movement control: these areas are interconnected and send projections to the superior colliculus and other brainstem ocular motor centres. Although the anatomical location of cortical gaze control areas has been well characterized in non-human primates, their precise location in the human brain is yet to be definitively established and appears to vary depending on the method used (<a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_1">Amiez and Petrides 2009</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0450">Two parallel pathways are involved in the cortical generation of saccades. An anterior system originates in the frontal eye field and projects, both directly and via the superior colliculus, to the brainstem saccadic generators. This pathway also passes indirectly via the basal ganglia to the superior colliculus. Projections from the frontal cortex influence cells in the pars reticularis of the substantia nigra, via a relay in the caudate nucleus. An inhibitory pathway from the pars reticulata projects directly to the superior colliculus. This may be a gating circuit related to voluntary saccades, especially of the memory-guided type. A posterior pathway originates in the parietal eye field and passes to the brainstem saccadic generators via the superior colliculus. This pathway is important for triggering reflexive saccades.</div><div class="text" id="p0455">The smooth pursuit system has developed relatively independently of the saccadic oculomotor system to maintain foveation of a moving target, although there are inevitable interconnections between the two. The first task is to identify and code the velocity and direction of a moving target. This is largely performed by secondary visual areas at the parietal–occipital–temporal lobe junction (human homologue of the middle temporal visual area (V5) and medial superior temporal visual area of monkeys). Descending pathways from these posterior cortical areas project to a group of nuclei that lie in the basal part of the pons, which in turn transfer the pursuit signal bilaterally to the cerebellum and ultimately to ocular motor neurones.</div><div class="text" id="p0460">The vestibulo-ocular reflex maintains coordination of vision during movement of the head and results in a compensatory conjugate eye movement that is equal but opposite to the movement of the head. This essentially three-neurone arc consists of primary vestibular neurones that project to the vestibular nuclei; secondary neurones that project from these nuclei directly to the abducens and oculomotor nuclei; and tertiary neurones that innervate the extraocular muscles. Vestibular neurones responding to head rotation also respond to optokinetic stimuli, which means that the neural substrate is likely to include both the visual and vestibular systems.</div><div class="text" id="p90465">Several cortical areas contribute to vergence movements. Posterior visual areas are responsible for sensory processing and generating reflexive, stimulus-linked movements, whereas the frontal cortex (frontal and supplementary eye fields) is more concerned with volitional, self-initiated movements (<a href="#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Leigh and Zee 2015</a>). These cortical regions project to the midbrain supraocular motor area, which encodes vergence eye movements and sends excitatory projections to medial rectus and lateral rectus motoneurones that generate convergence and divergence, respectively.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0375"/><hgroup><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0285">Vascular Supply and Lymphatic Drainage</h2><h3 class="h2after1" id="cesectitle0290">Arteries</h3></hgroup><section><a id="s0380"/><div class="textfl" id="p0470">Orbital vascular anatomy displays noteworthy inter-individual variation (<a href="#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Hayreh 2006</a>): the usual pattern and more common variations are presented below.

The intracanalicular part passes through the optic canal together with the ophthalmic artery. This is the weakest point of the anterior visual pathway because the nerve is fixed to its bony surroundings by fibrous adhesions. The intraorbital part passes forwards, laterally and downwards, and pierces the sclera at the lamina cribrosa, slightly medial to the posterior pole. It has a somewhat tortuous course within the orbit to allow for movements of the eyeball (<a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Demer 2016</a>).

It is closely related to the origins of the four recti, whereas more anteriorly, where the muscles diverge, it is separated from them by a substantial amount of orbital fat. Just beyond the optic canal, the ophthalmic artery and the nasociliary nerve cross the optic nerve to reach the medial wall of the orbit.

Ectropion describes the rolling out of the lower eyelid so that it is no longer in contact with the cornea, leading to epiphora (watering). Entropion describes the inversion of the eyelid with corresponding inturning of the eyelashes (trichiasis), which contact the cornea and cause irritation.</div><div class="text" id="p0740">Each eyelid margin is 2–3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm from front to back.

It is an important surgical landmark, since an incision at this point affords a relatively bloodless plane along which the eyelid can be split into anterior and posterior lamellae. The eyelashes lie in front of the grey line, and the circular openings of the tarsal (Meibomian) glands lie behind it. The tarsal glands are often visible through the palpebral conjunctiva, when the eyelids are everted, as a series of parallel, faint yellow lines arranged perpendicular to the lid margins.</div><div class="text" id="p0745">Eyelashes are short, thick, curved hairs, arranged in double or triple rows.

Various skin folds or furrows are of topographical interest. A prominent superior palpebral furrow or fold lies approximately opposite the upper margin of the tarsal plate and is deeply recessed when the lids are open. A prominent feature of Asian eyes is an absent or very low eyelid skin fold, which together with an inferior extension of the pre-aponeurotic fat pad gives rise to a fuller upper eyelid appearance and a narrower palpebral fissure (<a href="#bib60" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_60">Saonanon 2014</a>). Furthermore, Asians typically have a skin flap, the epicanthus, which begins laterally in the superior palpebral fold and progresses medially to cover the medial canthus. Infant Caucasians frequently have a transient epicanthus that sometimes persists in the adult. A less prominent inferior palpebral furrow occupies a similar position in the skin of the lower lid and deepens on downward gaze. A nasojugal furrow extends obliquely from the medial lower margin of the bony orbit to the cheek, and a malar furrow may be seen laterally along the inferior orbital rim in middle age, but only infrequently and faintly in the young.</div><div class="text" id="p0755">The palpebral fissure undergoes complex changes during infancy (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Fox 1966</a>, <a href="#bib49" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_49">Paiva et al 2001</a>).

The conjunctiva is conventionally divided into five regions: marginal, tarsal, orbital, bulbar and limbal): the marginal, tarsal and orbital regions are collectively referred to as the palpebral conjunctiva (see <a href="#f0135">Fig. 44.23</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0830">The marginal zone extends from a line immediately posterior to the openings of the tarsal glands and passes around the eyelid margin to continue on the inner surface of the lid as far as the subtarsal groove (a shallow sulcus that marks the marginal border of the tarsus). The tarsal conjunctiva is highly vascular and is firmly attached to the underlying tarsal plate. The orbital zone extends as far as the fornices, which mark the line of reflection of the conjunctiva from the lids on to the eyeball. The conjunctiva is more loosely attached to underlying tissues over the orbital zone and so folds readily. Elevations of the conjunctival surface in the form of papillae and lymphoid follicles (part of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, MALT) are commonly observed in this region (<a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Knop and Knop 2002</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0835">Ducts of the lacrimal gland open into the lateral part of the superior fornix. The bulbar conjunctiva is loosely connected to the eyeball over the exposed sclera; it is thin and transparent, and readily permits the visualization of conjunctival and episcleral blood vessels. The loose attachment of the conjunctiva to the fascial sheath of the globe (Tenon’s capsule) in this region means that the conjunctiva is freely movable here, but as the bulbar conjunctiva approaches the cornea, its surface becomes smoother and its attachment to the sclera increases.

The type of the epithelium and the thickness of the substantia propria vary with location. At the margin of the lids, the epithelium is non-keratinized stratified squamous and 10–12 cells thick. The epithelium of the tarsal conjunctiva thins to two or three layers and consists of columnar and flat surface cells. Near the fornices, the cells are taller, and a trilaminar conjunctival epithelium covers much of the bulbar conjunctiva. It thickens closer to the corneoscleral junction and then changes to stratified squamous epithelium typical of the cornea. A proportion of limbal conjunctival epithelial cells serve as stem cells for the corneal epithelium, which means that this region of the conjunctiva is essential for maintaining corneal integrity.</div><div class="text" id="p0845">Mucous-secreting goblet cells are scattered within the conjunctival epithelium.

With the exception of the tarsal conjunctiva, the substantia propria adjacent to the epithelium is mainly loose. It merges with the fibrous fascia bulbi and episclera in the limbal and bulbar regions, and is loosely attached to the sheaths of the recti. At the fornix, it is continuous with orbital fascial tissues and has loose attachments to the overlying tendon of levator palpebrae superioris and the superior tarsal muscle fascia superiorly, an arrangement that provides support for the fornix during eyeball rotation.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="787" id="pagebreak_787"/><a id="pg787"/></div></section><section><a id="s0650"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0530">Vascular supply and lymphatic drainage</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0855">The arteries of the palpebral conjunctiva are derived from the vascular arcades of the eyelids.

The substantia propria of the tarsal and orbital conjunctiva is richly vascular. A dense capillary network is arranged in a single subepithelial lamina, a distribution that meets the metabolic requirement of the cornea during sleep, when oxygen is available to the cornea only through this vascular system. The bulbar conjunctiva receives blood from the palpebral arcades and from the anterior ciliary arteries that reach the conjunctiva on the orbital surface of the recti.

It contains several proteins that play key roles in protecting the ocular surface from microbial infection (e.g. lysozyme, lactoferrin, immunoglobulin A (IgA)) and in maintaining ocular surface epithelial integrity.</div><div class="text" id="p0885">The lacrimal gland consists of orbital and palpebral parts that are continuous posterolaterally around the concave lateral edge of the aponeurosis of levator palpebrae superioris. The orbital part, about the size and shape of an almond, lodges in a shallow fossa on the medial aspect of the zygomatic process of the frontal bone, just within the orbital margin. It lies above levator palpebrae superioris and, laterally, above lateral rectus. Its lower surface is connected to the sheath of levator palpebrae superioris and its upper surface is connected to the orbital periosteum. Its anterior border is in contact with the orbital septum and its posterior border attached to the orbital fat. The palpebral part, about one-third the size of the orbital part, is subdivided into two or three lobules and extends below the aponeurosis of levator palpebrae superioris into the lateral part of the upper lid, where it is attached to the superior conjunctival fornix and is visible through the conjunctiva when the lid is everted.

By smoothing out irregularities of the corneal epithelium, it creates an even surface of good optical quality that is reformed with each blink. The air–tear interface forms the principal refractive surface of the optical system of the eye. Since the cornea is avascular, it is dependent on the tear film for its oxygen provision. When the eye is open, the tear film is in a state of equilibrium with the oxygen in the atmosphere, and gaseous exchange takes place across the tear–epithelial interface. The constant turnover of the tear film also provides a mechanism for the removal of metabolic waste products. Tears play a major role in the defence of the eye against microbial colonization; the washing action of the tear fluid reduces the likelihood of microbial adhesion to the ocular surface, and the tears contain a host of protective antimicrobial proteins. There is clinical evidence that tear fluid secretion may increase as a compensatory response to the loss of tear film stability caused by deficiency of the oily layer (<a href="#bib2" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Arita et al 2017</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0695"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0575">Lacrimal drainage pathway</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0930">There is a constant turnover of tears; their production is matched by elimination. Some tears are lost by evaporation or absorption across the conjunctiva, but the majority are eliminated via the nasolacrimal drainage system (see <a href="#f0140">Fig. 44.24</a>). Tears collect at the medial canthal angle, where they drain into the puncta of the upper and lower lids. The puncta drain into lacrimal canaliculi running just below the margins of the eyelids. Each lid contains one canaliculus, approximately 10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm long, that passes vertically from its punctum for about 2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm, then widens to form an ampulla, before passing medially (horizontally) towards the lacrimal sac: the superior canaliculus is smaller and shorter than its inferior counterpart.
