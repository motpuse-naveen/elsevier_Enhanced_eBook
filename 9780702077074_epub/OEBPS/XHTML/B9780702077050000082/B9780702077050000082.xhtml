The embryonic period covers the first 8 weeks of development (weeks following ovulation and fertilization resulting in pregnancy). The ages and stages of early human embryos were initially estimated by comparing their development with that of other embryos or with those of monkey embryos of known postovulatory ages. Because the external and internal development of embryos at any specified time may be different, a classification of human embryo development into 23 stages based on the internal and external features of embryos was developed by <a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Streeter (1942)</a>, and continued by <a href="#bib27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_27">O'Rahilly and Müller (1987)</a>, from detailed histological study of approximately 600 sectioned embryos in the Carnegie collection.

In humans, the male gametes are spermatozoa, which are produced from puberty onwards. Female gametes are released as secondary oocytes in the second meiotic metaphase, usually singly, in a cyclical fashion. The signal for the completion of the second meiotic division is fertilization, which stimulates the cell division cycle to resume, completing meiosis and extruding the second polar body (the second set of redundant meiotic chromosomes).</div><div class="text" id="p9035">Fertilization normally occurs in the ampullary region of the uterine tube, probably within 24 hours of ovulation. Very few spermatozoa reach the ampulla to achieve fertilization. They must undergo capacitation, a process that is still incompletely understood, and that may involve modifications of membrane sterols or surface proteins. They traverse the cumulus oophorus and corona radiata, then bind to specific glycoprotein receptors on the zona pellucida, ZP3 and ZP2. Interaction of ZP3 with the sperm head induces the acrosome reaction, in which fusion of membranes on the sperm head releases enzymes, such as acrosin, that help to digest the zona around the sperm head, allowing the sperm to reach the perivitelline space. In the perivitelline space, the spermatozoon fuses with the oocyte microvilli, possibly via two disintegrin peptides in the sperm head and integrin in the oolemma (<span class="bold"><a href="#f0025">Figs 8.4</a>, <a href="#f0030">8.5A</a></span>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0025"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000082/main.assets/f08-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0025"/><a id="fspara0025"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 8.4</span> The fertilization pathway: a succession of steps. After a sperm binds to the zona pellucida, the acrosome reaction takes place (see detail at top). The outer acrosomal membrane (blue), an enzyme-rich organelle in the anterior of the sperm head, fuses at many points with the plasma membrane surrounding the sperm head. Then those fused membranes form vesicles, which are eventually sloughed off from the head, exposing the acrosomal enzymes (red). The enzymes digest a path through the zona pellucida, enabling the sperm to advance. Eventually, the sperm meets and fuses with the secondary oocyte plasma membrane and this triggers cortical and zona reactions. First, enzyme-rich cortical granules in the oocyte cytoplasm release their contents (yellow) into the zona pellucida, starting at the point of fusion and progressing right and left. Next, in the zona reaction, the enzymes modify the zona pellucida, transforming it into an impenetrable barrier to sperm as a guard against polyspermy (multiple fertilization).</figcaption></figure></div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0030"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000082/main.assets/f08-05-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0030"/><a id="fspara0030"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 8.5</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, An unfertilized human secondary oocyte surrounded by the zona pellucida; the first polar body can be seen.

The calcium wave amplifies the local signal at the site of sperm–oocyte interaction and distributes it throughout the oocyte cytoplasm. The increase in calcium concentration is the signal that causes the oocyte to resume cell division, initiating the completion of meiosis II and setting off the developmental programme that leads to embryogenesis. The pulses of intracellular calcium that occur every few minutes for the first few hours of development also trigger the fusion of cortical granules with the oolemma. The cortical secretory granules release an enzyme that hydrolyses the ZP3 receptor on the zona pellucida and so prevents other sperm from binding and undergoing the acrosome reaction, thus establishing the block to polyspermy. The same cortical granule secretion may also modify the vitelline layer and oolemma, making them less susceptible to sperm–oocyte fusion and providing a further level of polyspermy block.</div><div class="text" id="p9045">The sperm head undergoes its protamine to histone transition as the second polar body is extruded. The two pronuclei form, the female one cortically near the site of emission of the second polar body. They move together and are juxtaposed prior to pronuclear membrane breakdown/syngamy and cleavage after approximately 24 hours after sperm and oocyte association (<a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Coticchio et al 2018</a>) (<a href="#f0030"><span class="bold">Fig. 8.5B</span></a>). Pronuclear fusion as such does not occur; no true zygote containing a membrane-bound nucleus forms. The two pronuclear envelopes disappear and the two chromosome groups move together to assume positions on the first cleavage spindle. Nucleolar ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA), and perhaps some messenger RNA (mRNA), are synthesized in pronuclei. A succeeding series of cleavage divisions produces eight even-sized blastomeres by approximately 55 hours, when embryonic mRNA is transcribed.</div><div class="text" id="p9050">The presence of the pronuclei from both parental origins is crucial for spatial organization and the controlled growth of cells, tissues and organs. In the mouse, embryos in which the paternal pronucleus has been removed and replaced with a second maternal pronucleus develop to a relatively advanced state (25 somites), but with limited development of the trophoblast and extraembryonic tissues. In contrast, embryos in which the maternal pronucleus has been replaced by a second paternal pronucleus develop very poorly, forming embryos of only six to eight somites, but with extensive trophoblast. Thus, it seems that the maternal genome is relatively more important for the development of the embryo, whereas the paternal genome is essential for the development of the extraembryonic tissues that would lead to placental formation.</div><div class="text" id="p9055">This functional inequivalence of homologous parental chromosomes is called parental imprinting. It occurs during the maturational phase of production of the haploid gametes in mammals and silences one allele by DNA methylation without changing the DNA sequence (<a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_26">Moore et al 2015</a><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="171" id="pagebreak_171"/>). Imprinted genes are heritable but in the next generation may be unmethylated during gametogenesis and re-established in the new germline. Between 50 and 90 imprinted genes expressed in the placenta and embryo have been identified, many concerned with embryogenesis and growth (<a href="../B9780702077050000082/B9780702077050000082.xhtml#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_22">Hanna et al 2018</a>). Although imprinted genes represent a small proportion of the genome, they are particularly important in blastocyst implantation, placentation, developmental growth rates and the embryonic nervous system. Some epigenetic modifications can lead to congenital anomalies and syndromes (<a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Butler 2009</a>, <a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_14">Batcheller et al 2011</a>, <a href="#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_19">Fauque 2013</a>
). For example, changes to the 15q11-13 domain if paternally imprinted lead to Prader–Willi syndrome (a disorder of growth) and if maternally imprinted cause Angelman syndrome (a neurological disorder); changes to the domain 11p15 affect IGF2 if paternally expressed and H19 if maternally expressed; both of these imprinted conditions affect growth regulation and trajectory in early development, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome results if the region is maternally imprinted (<a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Moore et al 2015</a>). Generally, paternally expressed genes enhance growth and maternally expressed genes suppress growth (<a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Butler 2009</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><section><a id="s0025"/><section><a id="s0030"/><h3 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0030"><span class="italic">In vitro</span> fertilization</h3><div class="textfl" id="p9060"><span class="italic">In vitro</span> fertilization (IVF) of human gametes is a successful way of overcoming most forms of infertility (<span class="bold">Video 8.1</span>). Controlled stimulation of the ovaries (e.g. pituitary downregulation using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone superactive analogues, followed by stimulation with purified, or recombinant, follicle stimulating hormone or urinary menopausal gonadotrophins) enables many preovulatory oocytes (often 10 or more) to be recruited and matured, and then aspirated transvaginally using ultrasound guidance, 34–38 hours after injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin (which is given to mimic the luteinizing hormone surge). These oocytes are then incubated overnight with motile spermatozoa in a specially formulated culture medium, in an attempt to achieve successful <span class="italic">in vitro</span> fertilization. In cases of severe male-factor infertility, in which there are insufficient normal spermatozoa to achieve conventional <span class="italic">in vitro</span> fertilization, individual spermatozoa can be directly injected into the oocyte in a process known as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), which is as successful as routine IVF. In cases in which there are no spermatozoa in the ejaculate, suitable material can sometimes be directly aspirated from the epididymis or surgically retrieved from the testes, and the extracted sperm are then used for intracytoplasmic injection.</div><div class="text" id="p9070">It is also now sometimes possible to assess embryos by preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) for the presence of monogenic/single gene diseases (PGT-M) or for structural chromosomal rearrangements (PGT-SR). A sample (biopsy) is removed from either the oocyte (polar bodies), the early cleavage stage embryo (a blastomere) or the blastocyst (small piece of trophectoderm), and subjected to specific genetic testing. Oocytes and embryos can also be biopsied and screened for errors in chromosome copy numbers using preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A). Unaffected embryos can then be identified for transfer to the recipient. Although increasingly utilized across all ages of IVF patients, there is debate over the efficacy of PGT-A. It is considered most clinically appropriate for women over 37 years of age due to increased aneuploidy levels in their oocytes. Embryos that are surplus to immediate therapeutic requirements can also be cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for later use. Propanediol or dimethylsulphoxide are commonly used as cryoprotectants for human embryos at all stages. Conception rates per cycle using ovarian stimulation, IVF and successive transfers of fresh and cryopreserved embryos exceed those obtained during non-assisted, or natural, conception.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="172" id="pagebreak_172"/><a id="pg172"/></div><div class="text" id="p9075">In 2014, some 40 years after the first IVF infant was born, more than 200,000 assisted reproductive technologies (ART) cycles were performed in the United States leading to nearly 60,000 live births. World-wide the prevalence of ART is now extensive.

It is now appreciated that the temporal conversations between oocyte/zygote/blastocyst and the mother are informed by dynamic exchange of environmental information some days before the close juxtaposition of the tissues seen in implantation, and that their effects extend into fetal growth and postnatal life (<a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml">Ch. 23</a>).

Cell division can be asynchronous and daughter cells may retain a cytoplasmic link through much of the immediately subsequent cell cycle via a midbody, as a result of the delayed completion of cytokinesis.

Thereafter, experimental inhibition of transcription blocks further division and development, indicating that activation of the embryonic genome is required. There is also direct evidence for the synthesis of embryonically encoded proteins at this time. As the genes of the embryo first become both active and essential, the previously functional maternally derived mRNA is destroyed, although protein made on these maternal templates does persist at least during blastocyst growth. Spontaneous developmental arrest of embryos cultured <span class="italic">in vitro</span> seems to occur during the cell cycle of gene activation, but it is not caused by total failure of that activation process. Early cleavage, up to the formation of eight cells, requires pyruvate or lactate as metabolic substrates, but thereafter more glucose is metabolized and may be required. Pyruvate availability in maternal uterine tube secretions may function as an extrinsic mechanism for embryonic genome activation (<a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_31">Pfeffer 2018</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p9095">The earliest time at which different types of cells can be identified within the cleaving embryo is when 8–16 cells are present. Before that time cells are essentially spherical, touch each other loosely, have no specialized intercellular junctions or significant extracellular matrix and the cytoplasm in each cell is organized in a radially symmetric manner around a centrally located nucleus. Once eight cells have formed, a process of compaction occurs that creates tension between adjacent cells. Cells flatten on each other maximizing intercellular contact, this initiates the formation of gap and focal tight junctions, and radically reorganizes their cytoplasmic conformation from a radially symmetric to a highly asymmetric phenotype. This latter process includes the migration of nuclei towards the centre of the blastocyst, <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="173" id="pagebreak_173"/><a id="pg173"/>the redistribution of surface microvilli and an underlying mesh of microfilaments and microtubules to the exposed surface, and the localization of endosomes beneath the apical cytoskeletal mesh. In the mouse, blastomeres extend filopodia onto the apical surfaces of neighbouring cells between cell divisions (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Fierro-González et al 2013</a>). As a result of the process of compaction, the embryo forms a primitive proto-epithelial cyst consisting of eight polarized cells, in which the apices face outwards and basolateral surfaces face internally. The focal tight junctions, which align to become increasingly linear, are localized to the boundary between the apical and basolateral surfaces. Gap junctions form between apposed basolateral surfaces and become functional.</div><div class="text" id="p9100">The process of compaction involves the cell surface and the calcium dependent cell–cell adhesion glycoprotein, E-cadherin (also called L-CAM or uvomorulin). Neutralization of its function disturbs all three elements of compaction. The entire process can function in the absence of both mRNA and protein synthesis. Post-translational controls are sufficient and seem to involve regulation through protein phosphorylation. Significantly, although E-cadherin is not synthesized and present on the surface of cleaving blastomeres, it first becomes phosphorylated when eight cells are visible, at the initiation of compaction.</div><div class="text" id="p9105">Compaction is important for the generation of cell diversity in the early embryo. As each polarized cell divides, it retains significant elements of its polar organization, so that its daughter cells inherit cytocortical domains, their nature reflecting their origin and organization in the original parent cell in the eight-celled embryo. Thus, if the axis of division is aligned approximately at right-angles to the axis of cell polarity, the more superficially placed daughter cell inherits all the apical cytocortex and some of the basolateral cytocortex and is polar, whereas the more centrally placed cell inherits only basolateral cytocortex and is apolar. In contrast, if the axis of division is aligned approximately along the axis of the cell polarity, two polar daughter cells are formed. In this way, two-cell populations are formed in the 16-cell embryo that differ in phenotype (polar, apolar) and position (superficial, deep). The number of cells in each population in an individual embryo will be determined by the ratio of divisions along, and at right-angles to, the axis of eight-cell polarity. The theoretical and observed limits of the polar to apolar ratio are 16<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>:<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>0 and 8<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>:<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>8 respectively. The outer polar cells contribute largely to the trophectoderm, whereas the inner apolar cells contribute almost exclusively to the inner cell mass in most embryos.</div><div class="text" id="p9110">In cleavage, the generation of cell diversity and commitment to either trophectoderm or inner cell mass, occurs in the 16-cell morula and precedes the formation of the blastocyst. During the 16-cell cycle, the outer polar cells continue to differentiate an epithelial phenotype, and display further aspects of polarity and intercellular adhesion typical of epithelial cells, while the inner apolar cells remain symmetrically organized. During the next cell division (16–32 cells), a proportion of polar cells again divide asymmetrically, as in the previous cycle, each yielding one polar and one apolar daughter cell displaying differentiation of the phenotype of the trophectoderm and inner cell mass respectively. Although such differentiative division at this time is less common than at the 8- to 16-cell transition, it has the important function of regulating an appropriate number of cells in the two cell phenotypes of the blastocyst. Thus, if differentiative divisions were relatively infrequent at the 8- to 16-cell transition, they will be more frequent at the 16- to 32-cell transition, and <span class="italic">vice versa</span>.</div><div class="text" id="p9115">After division to 32 cells, the outer polar cells complete their differentiation into a functional epithelium, display structurally complete zonular tight junctions and begin to form desmosomes.

Uterine implantations are often ipsilateral to the ovarian corpus luteum. Previous pelvic inflammatory disease, salpingitis or tubal surgery may predispose to blastocyst delay in tubal transport. The presence of an intrauterine contraceptive device or the use of progesterone-based oral contraceptives may also predispose to ectopic pregnancy, probably because of alteration in the normal tubal transport mechanisms.</div><div class="text" id="p9160">Ovarian or abdominal pregnancies are exceptionally rare. Apart from their important clinical implications, these conditions emphasize the fact that the blastocyst can implant successfully into tissues other than a normal progestational endometrium. Prolonged development can occur in such sites and is usually terminated by a mechanical or vascular accident and not by a fundamental nutritive or endocrine insufficiency or by an immune maternal response. Abdominal implantation may occur on any organ, e.g. bowel, liver or omentum. If such a pregnancy continues, this makes removal of the placenta at delivery or abortion hazardous as a result of haemorrhage and so the placenta is usually left <span class="italic">in situ</span> to degenerate spontaneously.</div><div class="text" id="p9165">Most ectopic pregnancies are anembryonic.

Monozygotic twins arise from a single ovum fertilized by a single sperm. At some stage up to the establishment of the axis of the embryonic area and the development of the primitive streak, the embryonic tissues separate into two parts, each of which gives rise to a complete embryo. The process of hatching of the blastocyst from the zona pellucida may result in constriction of the emerging cells and separation into two discrete entities. There is a gradual decrease in the average thickness of the zona pellucida with increasing maternal age, that may be causally related to the increase in frequency of monozygotic twinning with increased maternal age. The resultant twins have the same genotype but the description ‘identical twins’ is best avoided, since most monozygotic twins have differences in phenotypes. Late separation of twins from a single conceptus may result in conjoined twins; these may be equal or unequal, as in acardia. After twinning, monozygotic embryos enter a period of intense catch-up growth. Despite starting out at half the size, each twin embryo or fetus is of a size comparable to a singleton fetus in the second trimester of pregnancy, but declines in relative size in the last 10 weeks of pregnancy. The sex of monozygotic twins will be the same. Monoamniotic, monochorionic, monozygotic twins are most likely to be female, as are acardiac twins. The male to female ratio for all monozygotic twins is 0.487, and for monoamniotic, monochorionic twins it is 0.231.</div><div class="text" id="p9180">Dizygotic twins represent the most frequent form of twinning. They result from multiple ovulations, which can be induced by gonadotrophins or drugs commonly used in patients with infertility. Dizygotic twins may be different sexes; like-sex pairs are more common. The male to female ratio is 0.518. The presence of two gestation sacs can be <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="176" id="pagebreak_176"/><a id="pg176"/>identified on ultrasound examination at 4.5–5 postmenstrual weeks, but amniotic cavities cannot be seen clearly until 8 postmenstrual weeks. Multiple births greater than twinning, such as triplets or quadruplets, can arise from multiple ovulations, or from a single ovum, or both. It is most likely to be seen in women treated with drugs to stimulate ovulation.</div><div class="text" id="p9185">The range of separation of twin embryos is reflected in the separation of the extraembryonic membranes. The types of placentation that can occur are shown in <a href="#f0050"><span class="bold">Fig. 8.9</span></a>. Monoamniotic, monochorionic placentae are associated with the greatest perinatal mortality (50%), caused both by entanglement of the umbilical cords impeding the blood supply and by various vascular shunts between the placentae, which may divert blood from one fetus to the other. Artery–artery anastomoses are the most common, followed by artery–vein anastomoses. If the shunting of blood across the placentae from one twin to the other is balanced by more than one vascular connection, development may proceed unimpaired. However, if this is not the case, one twin may receive blood from the other, leading to cardiac enlargement, increased urination and polyhydramnios in the recipient, and anaemia, oligohydramnios and atrophy in the donor.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0050"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000082/main.assets/f08-09-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0050"/><a id="fspara0050"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 8.9</span> Relationships of the extraembryonic membranes in different types of twinning. <span class="bold">A</span>, Diamnionic, dichorionic separated; i.e. separation of the first two blastomeres results in separate implantation sites. <span class="bold">B</span>, Diamnionic, dichorionic fused; here the chorionic membranes are fused but the fetuses occupy separate choria. <span class="bold">C</span>, Diamnionic, monochorionic; reduplication of the inner cell mass can result in a single placenta and chorionic sacs but separate amniotic cavities. <span class="bold">D</span>, Monoamnionic, monochorionic; duplication of the embryonic axis results in two embryos sharing a single placenta, chorion and amnion. <span class="bold">E</span>, Incomplete separation of the embryonic axis results in conjoined twins. <span class="bold">F</span>, Unequal division of the embryonic axis or unequal division of the blood supply may result in an acardiac monster.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p9190">Dizygotic twins have either completely separate chorionic sacs or sacs that have fused.

They are arranged in a radial manner with extensive junctions near the centre of the mass of cells, supported by supranuclear organelles. A few epiblast cells are contiguous with cytotrophoblast cells: apart from this contact, a basal lamina surrounds what is initially a spherical cluster of epiblast cells isolating them from all other cells. Those epiblast cells adjacent to the hypoblast become taller and more columnar than those adjacent to the trophoblast, causing the epiblast sphere to flatten and shifting the centre of the sphere towards the polar trophoblast. Amniotic fluid accumulates at the eccentric centre of the now lenticular epiblast mass, which is bordered by apical junctional complexes and microvilli. As further fluid accumulates, an amniotic cavity forms, roofed by low cuboidal cells that possess irregular microvilli. The cells share short apical junctional complexes and associated desmosomes, and rest on an underlying basal lamina. The demarcation between true amnion cells and those of the remaining definitive epiblast is clear. The columnar epiblast cells are arranged as a pseudostratified layer with microvilli, frequently a single cilium, clefted nuclei and large nucleoli, and they have a distinct, continuous basal lamina. Cell division in the epiblast tends to occur near the apical surface, causing this region to become more crowded than the basal region. At the margins of the embryonic disc, the amnion cells are contiguous with the epiblast: there is a gradation in cell size from columnar to low cuboidal within a two- to three-cell span (<a href="#f0055"><span class="bold">Fig. 8.10</span></a>; see <a href="../B9780702077050000094/B9780702077050000094.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 9.1</a>).

Just before implantation, the hypoblast consists of a layer of squamous cells that is only slightly more extensive than the epiblast. The cells exhibit polarity, in that they show apical junctional complexes and apical microvilli that face the cavity of the blastocyst, but they lack a basal lamina. During early implantation, the hypoblast extends beyond the edges of the epiblast and can be subdivided into visceral hypoblast (cells contact the epiblast basal lamina), and parietal hypoblast (cells contact the mural trophoblast). Parietal hypoblast cells are squamous, may share adhesion junctions with the mural trophoblast and, rarely, may also share gap junctions. Visceral hypoblast cells are cuboidal, and have a uniform apical surface towards the blastocyst cavity but irregular basal and lateral regions, with flanges and projections underlying one <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="177" id="pagebreak_177"/><a id="pg177"/>another and extending into intercellular spaces. There is no basal lamina subjacent to the visceral hypoblast. The distance between the hypoblast cells and the epiblast basal lamina is variable.</div><div class="text" id="p9210">A series of modifications of the original blastocystic cavity develops beneath the hypoblast later than those developing above the epiblast. While the amniotic cavity is enlarging within the sphere of epiblast cells, the parietal hypoblast cells are proliferating and spreading along the mural trophoblast until they extend most of the way around the circumference of the blastocyst, converging towards the abembryonic pole. At the same time, a space appears between the parietal hypoblast and the mural trophoblast that limits the circumference of the hypoblastic cavity. A variety of terms have been applied to the parietal hypoblast layer: extraembryonic hypoblast, extraembryonic endoderm and exocoelomic (Heuser's) membrane. The cavity that the layer initially surrounds is the primary yolk sac (primary umbilical vesicle), and the resultant smaller cavity lined by hypoblast is the secondary yolk sac, seen from stage 6. The method of secondary yolk sac formation may involve: cavitation of visceral hypoblast (a method similar to formation of the amnion); rearrangement of proliferating visceral hypoblast; or folding of the parietal layer of the primary yolk sac into the secondary yolk sac. Further development of the yolk sac is described in <a href="../B9780702077050000094/B9780702077050000094.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>.</div><div class="text" id="p9215">Visceral hypoblast cells are thought to be important in many aspects of the early specification of cell lines and control of the timing of early development. They induce the formation and position of the primitive streak in the midline of the embryo, thus establishing the first axis of the embryonic disc, and they influence the timing of epiblast epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition at the primitive streak. The cells remain beneath the primitive streak: their experimental removal in avian embryos causes multiple embryonic axes to form. Visceral hypoblast cells are thought to be necessary for successful induction of the head region and for the successful specification of the primordial germ cells. With the later formation of the embryonic cell layers from the epiblast, the visceral hypoblast appears to be sequestered into the secondary yolk sac wall by the expansion of the newly formed embryonic endoderm beneath the epiblast, although there is now evidence that some hypoblast cells may remain in the final endoderm layer and contribute to the gut, and that they may also play a role in the induction of cardiogenesis.

A feature of this stage is the first formation of extraembryonic mesoblast, which will eventually cover the amnion, secondary yolk sac and the internal wall of the mural trophoblast, and will form the connecting stalk of the embryo containing the allantoenteric diverticulum. The origin of this first mesoblastic extraembryonic layer has yet to be established: several sources have been proposed, including the caudal region of the epiblast, the parietal hypoblast and subhypoblastic cells. A trophoblastic origin seems unlikely because there is always a complete basal lamina underlying the trophoblast and the migration of cells out of an epithelium is usually associated with previous disruption of the basal lamina. The origin of extraembryonic cells changes over time as new germinal populations are established.</div><div class="text" id="p9230">The first mesoblastic extraembryonic layer gives rise to the layer known as extraembryonic mesoblast, arranged as a mesothelium with underlying extraembryonic mesenchymal cells between the mural trophoblast and the primary yolk sac in stage 5.

Continued development and expansion of the extraembryonic coelom means that this attachment becomes increasingly restricted until it becomes a connecting stalk between the future caudal end of the embryonic disc and the chorion, forming a permanent pathway along which vascular anastomoses around the allantois establish communication with those of the chorion.</div></section></section></section></section><footer><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebib0010"/><h2 class="reftitle" id="s8010">References</h2><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebibsec9010"/><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib13"><!--<a hreef="#bib_13">13</a>. --><a id="ref2010"/><a href="#bib_13">Baltarowich</a> O.H, Scoutt L.M. <cite>Ectopic pregnancy</cite>. In: Norton M.E, Scoutt L.M, Feldstein V.A, eds. <cite><i>Callen’s Ultrasonography in Obstetrics and Gynecology</i></cite>. 6th ed. Elsevier; 2017 Ch 33.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib14"><!--<a hreef="#bib_14">14</a>. --><a id="ref3015"/><a href="#bib_14">Batcheller</a> A, Cardozo E, Maguire M, et al. <cite>Are there subtle genome-wide epigenetic alterations in normal offspring conceived by assisted reproductive technologies?</cite> <cite><i>Fertil Steril</i></cite>. 2011;96:616–623.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib15"><!--<a hreef="#bib_15">15</a>. --><a id="ref3020"/><a href="#bib_15">Brosens</a> J.J, Walker M.S, Teklenburg G. <cite>Uterine selection of human embryos at implantation</cite>. <cite><i>Sci Reports</i></cite>. 2014;4:3894.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib16"><!--<a hreef="#bib_16">16</a>. --><a id="ref3025"/><a href="#bib_16">Butler</a> M.G. <cite>Genomic imprinting disorders in humans: a mini review</cite>. <cite><i>J Assist Reprod Genet</i></cite>. 2009;26:477–486.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib17"><!--<a hreef="#bib_17">17</a>. --><a id="ref3130"/><a href="#bib_17">Coady</a> A.M. <cite>The first trimester gynaecological aspects</cite>. In: Allan P.L, Baxter G.M, Weston M.J, eds. <cite><i>Clinical Ultrasound</i></cite>. 3rd ed. Elsevier; 2011 Ch 39.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib18"><!--<a hreef="#bib_18">18</a>. --><a id="ref4435"/><a href="#bib_18">Coticchio</a> G, Mignini Renzini M, et al. <cite>Focused time-lapse analysis reveals novel aspects of human fertilization and suggests new parameters of embryo viability</cite>. <cite><i>Hum Reprod</i></cite>. 2018;33:23–31.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib19"><!--<a hreef="#bib_19">19</a>. --><a id="ref2340"/><a href="#bib_19">Fauque</a> P. <cite>Ovulation induction and epigenetic anomalies</cite>. <cite><i>Fertil Steril</i></cite>. 2013;99:1306–1311.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib20"><!--<a hreef="#bib_20">20</a>. --><a id="ref1145"/><a href="#bib_20">Fierro-González</a> J.C, White M.D, Silva J.C, et al. <cite>Cadherin-dependent filopodia control preimplantation embryo compaction</cite>. <cite><i>Nat Cell Biol</i></cite>. 2013;15:1424–1433.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib21"><!--<a hreef="#bib_21">21</a>. --><a id="ref5550"/><a href="#bib_21">Fleming</a> T.P, Watkins A.J, Velazquez M.A, et al. <cite>Origins of lifetime health around the time of conception: causes and consequences</cite>. <cite><i>Lancet</i></cite>. 2018;391:1842–1852.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib22"><!--<a hreef="#bib_22">22</a>. --><a id="ref4055"/><a href="#bib_22">Hanna</a> C.W, Demond H, Kelsey G. <cite>Epigenetic regulation in development: is the mouse a good model for the human?</cite> <cite><i>Hum Reprod Update</i></cite>. 2018;24:556–576.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib23"><!--<a hreef="#bib_23">23</a>. --><a id="ref6060"/><a href="#bib_23">Kaser</a> D.J, Ginsburg E.S, Carrell D.T, et al. <cite>Assisted reproduction</cite>. In: Strauss J, Barbieri R, Gargiulo A, eds. <cite><i>Yen &amp;
