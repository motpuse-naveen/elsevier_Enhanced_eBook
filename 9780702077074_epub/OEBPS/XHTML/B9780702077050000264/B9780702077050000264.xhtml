An anterior communicating artery unites both carotid arteries, by uniting both anterior cerebral arteries. Both the anterior and the posterior system, and the anterior and posterior communicating arteries form the circulus arteriosus of Willis. Roughly, the carotid system irrigates most of the brain, except the occipital lobe and part of the temporal lobe.

It has a high metabolic rate that reflects the energy requirements of constant neural activity. It receives about 15% of the cardiac output and utilizes 25% of the total oxygen consumption of the body. The brain is supplied by two internal carotid arteries and two vertebral arteries that form a complex anastomosis (circulus arteriosus cerebri, circle of Willis) on the base of the brain. Vessels diverge from this anastomosis to supply the various cerebral regions. In general, the internal carotid arteries and the vessels arising from them supply the forebrain, with the exception of the occipital lobe of the cerebral hemisphere, and the vertebral arteries and their branches supply the occipital lobe, the brainstem and the cerebellum. Venous blood from the brain drains into sinuses within the dura mater. Acute interruption of the blood supply to the brain for more than a few minutes causes permanent neurological damage.

Further anteriorly, it is separated from the trigeminal ganglion by the thin roof of the carotid canal, although this is often deficient. The artery is surrounded by a venous plexus and by the carotid autonomic plexus, derived from the internal carotid branch of the superior cervical ganglion.

The <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="416" id="pagebreak_416"/><a id="pg416"/>caroticotympanic artery is a small, occasionally double, vessel that enters the tympanic cavity by a foramen in the carotid canal and anastomoses with the anterior tympanic branch of the maxillary artery and the stylomastoid artery.

It turns anteriorly to the side of the body of the sphenoid within the cavernous sinus and then curves superiorly and medial to the anterior clinoid process, to emerge through the dural roof of the sinus. The oculomotor, trochlear, ophthalmic and abducens nerves are lateral to it within the cavernous sinus. The abducens nerve is closely related to the lateral wall of the internal carotid artery, whilst the oculomotor and trochlear nerves are situated in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus (see <a href="../B9780702077050000252/B9780702077050000252.xhtml#f0035">Figs 25.8</a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000252/B9780702077050000252.xhtml#f0040">25.9</a>). This explains the higher risk of abducens nerve injury secondary to pathology such as aneurysms of the cavernous part of the carotid artery. Occasionally, the caroticoclinoid ligament between the anterior and middle clinoid processes becomes ossified, forming a bony ring (caroticoclinoid foramen) around the artery (<a href="#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Ray and Gupta 2006</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0045">The cavernous part of the artery gives off a number of small vessels.

A minute meningeal branch passes over the lesser wing of the sphenoid to supply the dura mater and bone in the anterior cranial fossa, and also anastomoses with a meningeal branch of the posterior ethmoidal artery. Numerous small hypophysial branches supply the neurohypophysis, and are of particular importance because they form the pituitary portal system (see <a href="../B9780702077050000306/B9780702077050000306.xhtml#f0055">Fig. 30.11</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0040">Intracranial part</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0050">After piercing the dura mater, the internal carotid artery turns back below the optic nerve to run between it and the oculomotor nerve.

The ophthalmic artery arises from the anterior part of the internal carotid as it leaves the cavernous sinus, often at the point of piercing the dura, and enters the orbit through the optic canal. The posterior communicating artery (<a href="#f0020">Fig. 26.3</a>) runs back from the internal carotid above the oculomotor nerve, and anastomoses with the posterior cerebral artery (a terminal branch of the basilar artery), thereby contributing to the circulus arteriosus around the interpeduncular fossa. The posterior communicating artery is usually very small. However, sometimes it is so large that the posterior cerebral artery is supplied via the posterior communicating artery rather than from the basilar artery (‘fetal posterior communicating artery’, <a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Lambert et al 2016</a>); it is often larger on one side only. Small branches from its posterior half pierce the posterior perforated substance together with branches from the posterior cerebral artery. Collectively they supply the medial thalamic surface and the walls of the third ventricle. The anterior choroidal artery leaves the internal carotid just distal to its posterior communicating branch and passes back above the medial part of the uncus. It crosses the optic tract to reach and supply the crus cerebri of the midbrain, then turns laterally, recrosses the optic tract, and gains the lateral side of the lateral geniculate body, which it supplies with several branches. It finally enters the temporal (inferior) horn of the lateral ventricle via the choroidal fissure and ends in the choroid plexus. This small, but important, vessel also contributes to the blood supply of the globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, amygdala, hypothalamus, tuber cinereum, red nucleus, substantia nigra, posterior limb of the internal capsule, optic radiation, optic tract, hippocampus and the fimbria of the fornix.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0020"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000264/main.assets/f26-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0020"/><a id="fspara0020"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 26.3</span> The circulus arteriosus on the base of the brain. <span class="bold">A</span>, Volumetric reconstruction from real subject data showing the anatomical relations of the circulus arteriosus at the base of the brain. <span class="bold">B</span>, The distribution of central (perforating or ganglionic) branches.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0060">The combination of the petrous, cavernous and intracranial parts of the internal carotid artery is called the ‘carotid siphon’ because of its sigmoid course (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 26.1</a> and <span class="bold">Video 26.1</span>).

It lies in the subarachnoid space within the basal cisterns that surround the optic chiasma and infundibulum.

Although a complete circular channel almost always exists, one vessel is usually sufficiently narrowed to reduce its role as a collateral route and the circle is rarely functionally complete. Individual cerebral and communicating arteries may be absent, variably hypoplastic, double or even triple. The haemodynamics of the circle are influenced by variations in the calibre of communicating arteries and in the segments of the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries that lie between their origins and their junctions with the corresponding communicating arteries. The greatest variation in calibre occurs in the posterior communicating artery, which is normally very small, so that only limited flow is possible between the anterior and posterior circulations. Commonly, the diameter of the pre-communicating part of the posterior cerebral artery is larger than that of the posterior communicating artery, which means that the blood supply to the occipital lobes is mainly from the vertebrobasilar system. When the diameter of the pre-communicating part of the posterior cerebral artery is smaller than that of the posterior communicating artery, the blood supply to the occipital lobes is mainly from the internal carotid arteries via the posterior communicating arteries. The primary purpose of the vascular circle is to provide anastomotic channels if one vessel is occluded, but a normal-sized posterior communicating artery cannot usually fulfil this role. Agenesis or hypoplasia of the initial segment of the anterior cerebral artery are more frequent than anomalies in the anterior communicating artery and contribute to defective circulation in about one-third of individuals (<span class="bold">Video 26.1</span>).</div></section><section><a id="s0070"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0075">Central or perforating arteries</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0195">Numerous small central (perforating or ganglionic) arteries arise from the circulus arteriosus or from vessels near it (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 26.3</a>), and many enter the brain through the anterior and posterior perforated substances. Central branches supply nearby structures on or near the base of the brain together with the interior of the cerebral hemisphere, including the internal capsule, basal ganglia and thalamus. These branches form four principal groups (antero- and posteromedial and antero- and posterolateral). Arteries in the anteromedial group arise from the anterior cerebral and anterior communicating arteries, and pass through the medial part of the anterior perforated substance. They supply the optic chiasma, lamina terminalis, anterior, preoptic and supraoptic areas of the hypothalamus, septum, para-olfactory areas, anterior columns of the fornix, cingulate gyrus, rostrum of the corpus callosum and the anterior part of the putamen and the head of the caudate nucleus. Arteries in the posteromedial group arise from the entire length of the posterior communicating artery and from the proximal portion of the posterior cerebral artery. Anteriorly, they supply the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, and the anterior and medial parts of the thalamus via thalamo-perforating arteries. Caudally, they supply the mammillary bodies, subthalamus, the lateral wall of the third ventricle, including the medial thalamus, and the globus pallidus. Arteries in the anterolateral group are mainly branches from the proximal part of the middle cerebral artery; they are also known as striate, lateral striate or lenticulostriate arteries. They enter the brain through the anterior perforated substance and supply the posterior striatum, lateral globus pallidus and the anterior limb, genu and posterior limb of the internal capsule. The medial striate artery, derived from the middle or anterior cerebral arteries, supplies the rostral part of the caudate nucleus and putamen, and the anterior limb and genu of the internal capsule. Arteries in the posterolateral group arise from the posterior cerebral artery distal to its junction with the posterior communicating artery, and supply the cerebral peduncle, colliculi, pineal gland and, via thalamogeniculate branches, the posterior thalamus and medial geniculate body.</div></section><section><a id="s0075"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0080">Regional arteries of the brain</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0085">Brainstem</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0080"/><div class="textfl" id="p0200">The medulla oblongata is supplied by branches of the vertebral, anterior and posterior spinal, posterior inferior cerebellar and basilar arteries, which enter along the ventral median fissure and the dorsal median sulcus.

This has been demonstrated for many brain areas, including the motor and sensory cortical regions, areas involved in convulsive activity and cortical areas involved in complex thought processes. The principal local factors affecting regional blood flow are the local hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>) or carbon dioxide concentrations, which cause arterial dilation both by a direct action on the endothelium and through indirect mediators, such as nitric oxide.</div><div class="text" id="p0265">Not all substances circulating in arterial blood have access to the brain parenchyma: particulate matter, such as bacteria, is excluded.

The lack of blood flow can be due to pathology in the vessel lumen, such as thrombosis or embolus (common); pathology outside the blood vessel, such as occlusion from the mass effect of a tumour or haematoma (rare); or pathology of the vessel wall, such as inflammatory or infective arteritides (rare). The symptoms and signs of ischaemic stroke depend on the location and extent of the arterial infarction (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">Bogousslavsky and Caplan 2002</a>).

The primary role of the circulus arteriosus is to allow for this eventuality by redirecting blood from other sources, such as the contralateral internal carotid artery and vertebrobasilar system. If the circulus arteriosus is complete, two or even three of the four major arteries supplying the brain can be occluded without producing an ischaemic stroke. Unfortunately, the circulus arteriosus is rarely haemodynamically complete and ischaemic stroke often occurs because the collateral supply is inadequate.</div><div class="text" id="p0280">For example, an individual in whom neither anterior nor posterior communicating arteries are patent will suffer an ischaemic stroke if there is occlusion of one internal carotid artery because the proximal anterior and middle cerebral arteries cannot receive collateral flow via the incomplete circulus arteriosus. Some collateral flow may be available from anastomoses between distal branches of the external carotid artery (e.g. middle meningeal artery) but invariably this is not sufficient to supply the whole hemisphere.</div><div class="text" id="p0285">Somewhat paradoxically, the more distally an occlusion occurs in the cerebral vasculature, the more likely it is to cause an ischaemic stroke (although the volume of infarcted tissue will be less). This is because the major capacity to form collateralization is proximal, mainly at the circulus arteriosus. For example, an embolus formed in the proximal internal carotid artery may travel to the M1 portion of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery and occlude the vessel. There is very little scope for collateralization at this site and an ischaemic stroke is unavoidable, unless the embolus can be cleared and flow restored in good time.</div><section><a id="s0130"/><section><a id="s0135"/><section><a id="s0140"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0130">Watershed areas</p><div class="textfl" id="p0290">Regions of the brain lying at the extreme edges of the major cerebral arterial territories are called watershed areas and are the first to be deprived of sufficient blood flow in the event of cerebral hypoperfusion.

The basal veins pass back alongside the interpeduncular fossa and midbrain, receiving tributaries from this vicinity, and join the great cerebral vein.</div><div class="text" id="p0350">Inferior cerebral veins on the orbital surface of the frontal lobe join the superior cerebral veins and thus drain to the superior sagittal sinus. Those on the temporal lobe anastomose with basal veins and middle cerebral veins, and drain to the cavernous, superior petrosal and transverse sinuses.</div><div class="text" id="p0355">The basal vein is formed at the anterior perforated substance by the union of several vessels: a small anterior cerebral vein, which accompanies the anterior cerebral artery; a deep middle cerebral vein, which receives tributaries from the insula and neighbouring gyri, and runs in the lateral cerebral fissure; and striate veins, which emerge from the anterior perforated substance. The basal vein passes back round the cerebral peduncle to the great cerebral vein and receives tributaries from the interpeduncular fossa, temporal horn of the lateral ventricle, parahippocampal gyrus and midbrain.</div><div class="text" id="p0360">The internal cerebral vein drains the deep parts of the hemisphere and the choroid plexuses of the third and lateral ventricles (<a href="#f0060">Fig. 26.12</a>). It is formed behind the column of the fornix, near the interventricular foramen, primarily by union of the thalamostriate and choroidal veins, although numerous smaller veins from surrounding structures also converge here. The thalamostriate vein runs anteriorly, between the caudate nucleus and thalamus, and receives many tributaries from both. The choroidal vein runs a convoluted course along the whole choroid <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="423" id="pagebreak_423"/><a id="pg423"/>plexus, and receives veins from the hippocampus, fornix, corpus callosum and adjacent structures. After their formation, the two internal cerebral veins travel back parallel to one another beneath the splenium of the corpus callosum, where they unite to form the great cerebral vein (<a href="#f0065">Fig. 26.13</a>). The great cerebral vein is a short median vessel that curves sharply up around the splenium of the corpus callosum and opens into the anterior end of the straight sinus after receiving the right and left basal veins (<span class="bold">Video 26.2</span>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0060"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000264/main.assets/f26-11-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0060"/><a id="fspara0060"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 26.12</span> The internal (deep) cerebral veins, viewed from above after removal of the central portion of the corpus callosum.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0065"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000264/main.assets/f26-12-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0065"/><a id="fspara0065"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 26.13</span> Phase contrast magnetic resonance venograms taken at 3.0T in lateral (<span class="bold">A</span>), frontal (<span class="bold">B</span>) and superior (<span class="bold">C</span>) projections. <span class="bold">D</span>, A CT venogram, sagittal section in the midline.</figcaption></figure></div><section><a id="s0175"/><section><a id="s0180"/><section><a id="s0185"/><section><a id="s0190"/><section><a id="s0195"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0165">Intracranial venosinus thrombosis</p><div class="textfl" id="p0365">One of the most potentially serious pathologies affecting the intracranial venous system is venosinus thrombosis (<a href="#f0075">Fig. 26.14</a>).

Conditions that increase the coagulability of the blood, such as the oral contraceptive pill, pregnancy, dehydration and inborn abnormalities of the coagulation pathways, are also risk factors.</div><div class="text" id="p0375">Individuals with intracranial venosinus thrombosis at its most severe present moribund, in coma or with major seizure activity, and in these situations the prognosis is poor. The clot within the dural sinuses and/or cortical veins obstructs the drainage of venous blood from the brain and causes venous hypertension. As the pressure in the venous system approaches the arterial pressure, the blood flow perfusing the affected parts of the brain decreases. If it dips below a critical level, the brain tissue will become ischaemic and may die (venous infarction). As the arterial supply to the brain is still present, the infarcted areas of the brain frequently undergo major haemorrhage and this is often the factor that kills the patient.</div><div class="text" id="p0380">Clinicians distinguish between thrombosis that affects the ‘superficial’ and ‘deep’ venous systems, although they may occur together. Superficial thrombosis usually occurs in the superior sagittal sinus (with or without involvement of the cortical veins). Deep intracranial thrombotic disease usually affects the great cerebral vein and the straight sinus. The parts of the cerebral hemispheres affected are different in the two situations: superficial thrombosis affects the cerebral hemispheres (particularly the white matter) and deep thrombosis affects the thalami and basal ganglia. A common feature is the tendency for bilateral involvement because all of the main draining venous channels are in the midline and accept venous drainage from both hemispheres. If the extent of the intracranial venosinus thrombosis is less severe, or if alternative venous drainage has been accommodated by reasonable collateral channels, the patient may have more modest symptoms such as headaches or visual disturbance. Those symptoms are due to raised intracranial pressure and, if untreated, may become chronic.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="424" id="pagebreak_424"/><a id="pg424"/></div></section></section></section></section></section></section></section></section><footer><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="424.e1" id="pagebreak_424.e1"/><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebib0010"/><h2 class="reftitle" id="s0200">References</h2><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebibsec0010"/><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib10"><!--<a hreef="#bib_10">10</a>. --><a id="ref0055"/><a href="#bib_10">Andeweg</a> J. <cite>The anatomy of collateral venous flow from the brain and its value in aetiological interpretation of intracranial pathology</cite>. <cite><i>Neurorad</i></cite>. 1996;38:621–628.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib11"><!--<a hreef="#bib_11">11</a>. --><a id="nspara0010"/>A brief historical review is included.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib12"><!--<a hreef="#bib_12">12</a>. --><a id="ref0060"/><a href="#bib_12">Bogousslavsky</a> J, Caplan L. <cite><i>Stroke Syndromes</i></cite>. 2nd ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; 2002.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib13"><!--<a hreef="#bib_13">13</a>. --><a id="nspara0015"/>A classic textbook encompassing all aspects of stroke.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib14"><!--<a hreef="#bib_14">14</a>. --><a id="ref0065"/><a href="#bib_14">Duvernoy</a> H.M, Delon S, Vannson J.L. <cite>Cortical blood vessels of the human brain</cite>. <cite><i>Brain Res Bull</i></cite>. 1981;7:519–579.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib15"><!--<a hreef="#bib_15">15</a>. --><a id="nspara0020"/>A detailed study of pial and intracortical vessels of the cerebellar cortex.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib16"><!--<a hreef="#bib_16">16</a>. --><a id="ref0070"/><a href="#bib_16">Duvernoy</a> H, Delon S, Vannson J.L. <cite>The vascularization of the human cerebellar cortex</cite>. <cite><i>Brain Res Bull</i></cite>. 1983;11:419–480.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib17"><!--<a hreef="#bib_17">17</a>. --><a id="nspara0025"/>A detailed study of pial and intracortical vessels of the cerebral cortex.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib18"><!--<a hreef="#bib_18">18</a>. --><a id="ref0075"/><a href="#bib_18">Kaplan</a> H.A, Ford D.H. <cite><i>The Brain Vascular System</i></cite>. Amsterdam: Elsevier; 1966.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib20"><!--<a hreef="#bib_20">20</a>. --><a id="ref0080"/><a href="#bib_20">Lambert</a> S.L, Williams F.J, Oganisyan Z.Z, et al. <cite>Fetal-type variants of the posterior cerebral artery and concurrent infarction in the major arterial territories of the cerebral hemisphere</cite>. <cite><i>J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep</i></cite>. 2016;4 doi: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2324709616665409">10.1177/2324709616665409</a> 2324709616665409.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib21"><!--<a hreef="#bib_21">21</a>. --><a id="ref0085"/><a href="#bib_21">Plets</a> C, De Reuck J, Vander Eecken H, et al. <cite>The vascularization of the human thalamus</cite>. <cite><i>Acta Neurol Belg</i></cite>. 1970;70:687–770.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib23"><!--<a hreef="#bib_23">23</a>. --><a id="ref0090"/><a href="#bib_23">Puchades-Orts</a> A, Nombela-Gomez M, Ortu-o-Pacheco G. <cite>Variation in form of the circle of Willis.
