It communicates with the temporal fossa superiorly deep to the zygomatic arch; the orbit anteriorly through the inferior orbital fissure; the pterygopalatine fossa medially through the pterygomaxillary fissure; the middle fossa through the foramina ovale and spinosum. It contains lateral and medial pterygoid, the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, the chorda tympani (facial nerve), the otic ganglion, the maxillary artery and the pterygoid venous plexus.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">The infratemporal fossa has a roof and anterior, lateral and medial walls, and is open to the neck posteroinferiorly, which means that it has no anatomical floor. Approximately 80% of the roof is formed by the infratemporal surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid. The remainder is formed by the infratemporal surface of the temporal bone, ending at the articular eminence of the temporomandibular joint and the spine of the sphenoid on the deep medial aspect. The roof contains the foramina ovale and spinosum. The anterior wall is formed by the posterior surface of the maxilla, ending inferiorly at the maxillary tuberosity. The inferior orbital fissure forms the upper limit of the anterior wall, meeting the pterygomaxillary fissure at right-angles. The medial wall is formed anteriorly by the lateral pterygoid plate of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid, and more posteromedially by the pharynx and tensor and levator veli palatini. It contains the pterygomaxillary fissure, across which structures pass between the infratemporal and pterygopalatine fossae (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 38.1</span></a>).

This muscle lies in the roof of the fossa and runs anteroposteriorly in a more or less horizontal plane from the region of the pterygoid plates to the mandibular condyle. Branches of the mandibular nerve and the main origin of medial pterygoid are deep relations and the maxillary artery is superficial. The buccal branch of the mandibular nerve passes between the two heads of lateral pterygoid. Medial pterygoid and the lingual and inferior alveolar nerves emerge below its inferior border, and the deep temporal nerves and vessels emerge from its upper border. The pterygoid venous plexus lies around and within lateral pterygoid and is important in the spread of infection.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">There is a lack of consensus in the surgical literature with regard to both the boundaries and contents of the infratemporal fossa. Thus, the fossa is sometimes defined as the anatomical space beneath the floor of the middle fossa, incorporating the remainder of the subcranial temporal bone as part of the roof, with the exception of the glenoid fossa of the temporomandibular joint. In this description, the fossa is limited posteriorly by the prevertebral fascia and includes the internal carotid artery, the internal jugular vein, the lower cranial nerves, the cervical sympathetic trunk, and the styloid process with its attached muscles and ligaments. Alternatively, the ‘extended’ infratemporal fossa is said to consist of the parapharyngeal and masticator spaces (<a href="#f0090"><span class="bold">Fig. 38.2</span></a>) (<a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Bejjani et al 1998</a>, <a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_28">Falcon et al 2010</a>, <a href="#bib39" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_39">Hosseini et al 2012</a>, <a href="#bib45" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_45">Joo et al 2013</a>).</div><div id="p0030"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0090"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000380/main.assets/on38-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0090"/><a id="fspara0090"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 38.2</span> The ‘extended’ infratemporal fossa.

It contains two air sinuses separated by a septum. Its cerebral (superior) surface articulates anteriorly with the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone via the smooth jugum sphenoidale, which is related to the overlying gyri recti and olfactory tracts. The jugum is bounded behind by the anterior border of the sulcus chiasmaticus leading laterally to the optic canals. The tuberculum sellae is posterior; behind it is the deeply concave sella turcica that houses the hypophysis cerebri within the hypophysial fossa. The anterior edge of the sella turcica is completed laterally by two middle clinoid processes. Posteriorly, the sella turcica is bounded by a square dorsum sellae with superior angles that bear variable posterior clinoid processes. The diaphragma sella and the tentorium cerebelli are attached to the clinoid processes. On each side, below <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="665" id="pagebreak_665"/><a id="pg664.e1"/>the dorsum sellae, a small petrosal process articulates with the apex of the petrous part of the temporal bone. The body of the sphenoid slopes directly into the basilar part of the occipital bone posterior to the dorsum sellae and together these bones form the clivus. In the growing child, this is the site of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis: premature closure of this joint gives rise to the skull appearances seen in achondroplasia.</div><div class="text" id="p0050">The lateral surfaces of the body are united with the greater wings and the medial pterygoid plates. A broad carotid sulcus accommodates both the internal carotid artery and the cranial nerves associated with the cavernous sinus above the root of each wing. The sulcus is deepest posteriorly and is overhung medially by the petrosal part of the temporal bone. Its sharp lateral margin, the lingula, continues back over the posterior opening of the pterygoid canal.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="666" id="pagebreak_666"/><a id="pg666"/></div><div class="text" id="p0055">A median triangular bilaminar sphenoidal crest on the anterior surface of the body of the sphenoid makes a small contribution to the nasal septum. The anterior border of the crest articulates with the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone, and a sphenoidal sinus opens on either side of it. In the articulated state, the sphenoidal sinuses are closed anteroinferiorly by the sphenoidal conchae that are almost inevitably destroyed when disarticulating a dried skull. Each half of the anterior surface of the body of the sphenoid possesses a superolateral depressed area joined to the ethmoidal labyrinth that completes the posterior ethmoidal sinuses; a lateral margin that articulates with the orbital plate of the ethmoid above and the orbital process of the palatine bone below; and an inferomedial, smooth, triangular area that forms the posterior nasal roof. The orifice of a sphenoidal sinus lies near the superior angle of this triangular area.</div><div class="text" id="p0060">The inferior surface of the body of the sphenoid bears a median triangular sphenoidal rostrum, embraced above by the diverging lower margins of the sphenoidal crest. The narrow anterior end of the rostrum fits into a fissure between the anterior parts of the alae of the vomer, and the posterior ends of the sphenoidal conchae flank the rostrum, articulating with its alae. A thin vaginal process projects medially from the base of the medial pterygoid plate on each side of the posterior part of the rostrum, behind the apex of the sphenoidal concha.</div></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0040">Greater wings</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0065">The greater wings of the sphenoid curve broadly superolaterally from the body. Posteriorly, each is triangular, fitting the angle between the petrous and squamous parts of the temporal bone at a sphenosquamosal suture. The cerebral surface contributes to the anterior part of the middle cranial fossa. Deeply concave, its undulating surface is adapted to the anterior gyri of the temporal lobe of the cerebral hemisphere. The foramen rotundum lies anteromedially and transmits the maxillary nerve. The foramen ovale, posterolateral to the foramen rotundum, transmits the mandibular nerve, accessory meningeal artery and sometimes the lesser petrosal nerve, although the latter nerve may have its own canaliculus innominatus medial to the foramen spinosum. When present, a small emissary sphenoidal foramen (foramen of Vesalius) transmits a small vein from the cavernous sinus, and can lie medial to the foramen ovale (on one or both sides). The foramen spinosum lies behind the foramen ovale and transmits the middle meningeal artery and meningeal branch of the mandibular nerve.</div><div class="text" id="p0070">The lateral surface is vertically convex and divided by a transverse infratemporal crest into temporal (upper) and infratemporal (lower) surfaces. Temporalis is attached to the temporal surface. The infratemporal surface is directed downwards and, with the infratemporal crest, is the site of attachment of the upper fibres of lateral pterygoid. It contains the foramen ovale and foramen spinosum. The small downward-projecting spine of the sphenoid lies posterior to the foramen spinosum; the sphenomandibular ligament is attached to its tip. The medial side of the spine bears a faint anteroinferior groove for the chorda tympani nerve and appears in the lateral wall of the sulcus for the pharyngotympanic tube. A ridge passes downwards to the front of the lateral pterygoid plate, medial to the anterior end of the infratemporal crest, and forms a posterior boundary of the pterygomaxillary fissure.</div><div class="text" id="p0075">The quadrilateral orbital surface of the greater wing faces anteromedially and forms the posterior part of the lateral wall of the orbit. It has a serrated upper edge that articulates with the orbital plate of the frontal bone, and a serrated lateral margin that articulates with the zygomatic bone. Its smooth inferior border is the posterolateral edge of the inferior orbital fissure, and its sharp medial margin forms the inferolateral edge of the superior orbital fissure, on which a small tubercle gives partial attachment to the common anular ocular tendon. Below the medial end of the superior orbital fissure, a grooved area forms the posterior wall of the pterygopalatine fossa that is pierced by the foramen rotundum.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">The irregular margin of the greater wing, from the body of the sphenoid to the spine, is an anterior limit of the medial half of the foramen lacerum. It contains the posterior aperture of the pterygoid canal and its lateral half articulates with the petrous part of the temporal bone at a sphenopetrosal synchondrosis. The sulcus tubae inferior to the synchondrosis contains the cartilaginous pharyngotympanic (auditory) tube. Anterior to the spine of the sphenoid the concave squamosal margin is serrated, bevelled internally below and externally above, for articulation with the squamous part of the temporal bone. The tip of the greater wing, bevelled internally, articulates with the sphenoidal angle of the parietal bone at the pterion. Medial to this, a triangular rough area articulates with the frontal bone; its medial angle is continuous with the inferior boundary of the superior orbital fissure, and its anterior angle joins the zygomatic bone by a serrated articulation. Fractures of the zygomatic bone preferentially pass through this articulation with the greater wing because it is a line of weakness in the lateral orbit.</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0045">Lesser wings</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0085">The lesser wings of the sphenoid are triangular pointed plates that protrude laterally from the anterosuperior regions of the body. The superior surface of each wing is smooth and related to the frontal lobe of the cerebral hemisphere. The inferior surface is a posterior part of the orbital roof and upper boundary of the superior orbital fissure and overhangs the middle cranial fossa. The posterior border projects into the lateral fissure of the cerebral hemisphere. The medial end of the lesser wing forms the anterior clinoid process: the anterior and middle clinoid processes are sometimes united to form a caroticoclinoid foramen. The lesser wing is connected to the body by a thin, flat anterior root and a thick, triangular posterior root (the optic strut), between which lies the optic canal. The optic strut extends from the base of the anterior clinoid process to the body and separates the optic canal from the superior orbital fissure. The optic canal is bounded by the body of the sphenoid medially, the lesser wing superiorly, and the optic strut inferiorly and laterally.</div></section><section><a id="s0040"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0050">Superior orbital fissure</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0090">The superior orbital fissure connects the cranial cavity with the orbit. It is bounded medially by the body of the sphenoid; above by the lesser wing of the sphenoid; below by the medial margin of the orbital surface of the greater wing; and laterally, between the greater and lesser wings, by the frontal bone. The contents of the superior orbital fissure are described in <a href="../B9780702077050000446/B9780702077050000446.xhtml">Chapter 44</a> (see <a href="../B9780702077050000446/B9780702077050000446.xhtml#f0025">Fig. 44.4</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0045"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0055">Pterygoid processes</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0095">The pterygoid processes descend perpendicularly from the junctions of the greater wings and body. Each consists of a medial and lateral plate with upper parts that are fused anteriorly. The plates are separated below by the angular pterygoid fissure: the margins of the fissure articulate with the pyramidal process of the palatine bone and diverge behind. Medial pterygoid lies in the cuneiform pterygoid fossa between the plates. Above is the small, oval, shallow scaphoid fossa, formed by division of the upper posterior border of the medial plate. Part of tensor veli palatini is attached to the fossa. The anterior surface of the root of the pterygoid process is broad and triangular: it forms the posterior wall of the pterygopalatine fossa and is pierced by the anterior opening of the pterygoid canal.</div><section><a id="s0050"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0060">Lateral pterygoid plate</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0100">The lateral pterygoid plate is broad, thin and everted. The lateral surface forms part of the medial wall of the infratemporal fossa and the lower part of lateral pterygoid is attached to it. The medial surface is the lateral wall of the pterygoid fossa and most of the deep head of medial pterygoid is attached to it. The upper part of its anterior border is a posterior boundary of the pterygomaxillary fissure, and the lower part articulates with the palatine bone. The posterior border is free.</div></section><section><a id="s0055"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0065">Medial pterygoid plate</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0105">The medial pterygoid plate is narrower and longer than the lateral. Its lower end is continued into an unciform projection, the pterygoid hamulus, which curves laterally. The pterygomandibular raphe is attached to the hamulus, and the tendon of tensor veli palatini winds around the hamulus. The lateral surface forms the medial wall of the pterygoid fossa and the medial surface provides a lateral boundary for the posterior nasal aperture. The medial plate is prolonged above on the inferior aspect of the body of the sphenoid as a thin vaginal process that articulates anteriorly with the sphenoidal process of the palatine bone and medially with the ala of the vomer. The plate articulates with the posterior border of the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone in the lower part of its anterior margin. Inferiorly, it bears a furrow that is converted anteriorly into the palatovaginal canal by the sphenoidal process of the palatine bone. The palatovaginal canal transmits pharyngeal branches of the maxillary artery and pterygopalatine ganglion. The pharyngobasilar fascia is attached to the whole of the posterior margin of the medial plate, and the superior pharyngeal constrictor is attached to its lower end. The small pterygoid tubercle is found at the upper end of the plate, just below the posterior opening of the pterygoid canal. The processus tubarius, which supports the cartilaginous pharyngeal end of the pharyngotympanic tube, projects back near the midpoint of the margin of the medial pterygoid plate.</div><div class="text" id="p0110">Though adjacent, the medial and lateral pterygoid plates have distinct roles. The lateral plate is the province of the infratemporal fossa and masticator space, forming part of the medial boundary of the infratemporal fossa and providing attachment for the lateral and medial pterygoids.

Much of the bone is preformed in cartilage. There are six ossification centres for the presphenoidal parts and eight centres for the postsphenoidal parts.</div><section><a id="s0080"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0085">Presphenoidal part</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0135">At about postfertilization weeks 8–9 (postmenstrual week 10–11), a centre appears in each wing, lateral to the optic canal; two bilateral centres appear in the presphenoidal body a little later. Each sphenoidal concha has a centre that appears superoposteriorly in the nasal capsule during postmenstrual weeks 17–20. As it enlarges, it partly surrounds a posterosuperior expansion of the nasal cavity that becomes the sphenoidal sinus. The posterior conchal wall is absorbed and the sinus invades the presphenoidal component. The concha fuses with the ethmoidal labyrinth in the fourth year and with the sphenoid and palatine bones before puberty; its anterior deficiency persists as an opening for the sphenoidal sinus.</div></section><section><a id="s0085"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0090">Postsphenoidal part</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0140">The first centres appear in the greater wings at about postmenstrual week 11, one in the basal cartilage of each wing below the foramen rotundum. These centres only contribute to the root of the greater wing (near the foramen rotundum and pterygoid canal). The remainder of the greater wing and the lateral pterygoid plate are ossified in mesenchyme. Two centres flanking the sella turcica appear between postmenstrual weeks 13 and 16 and soon fuse. The medial pterygoid plates are also ossified in ‘membrane’, a centre in each probably appearing in about postmenstrual weeks 9 or 10. The hamulus is chondrified during postmenstrual weeks 9–12 and begins to ossify at once. The medial and lateral pterygoid plates join at about postmenstrual weeks 21–24. A centre for each lingula appears during postmenstrual weeks 13–16 and soon joins the body. The neonatal optic canal is relatively large and has a keyhole or ‘figure of eight’ shape rather than the circular profile seen in the adult (<a href="#bib51" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_51">Lang 2001</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0090"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0095">Postnatal details</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0145">Presphenoidal and postsphenoidal parts fuse at about postmenstrual weeks 29–32; an unciform cartilage persists after birth in the lower parts of this junction. At birth, the bone is tripartite and consists of a central part (body and lesser wings) and two lateral parts that each consist of a greater wing and pterygoid process. During the first year, the greater wings and body unite around the pterygoid canals, and the lesser wings extend medially above the anterior part of the body, meeting to form the smooth, elevated jugum sphenoidale. By the twenty-fifth year, the sphenoid and occipital bones are completely fused. An occasional vascular foramen, often erroneously termed the craniopharyngeal canal, is occasionally seen in the anterior part of the hypophysial fossa.</div><div class="text" id="p0150">Although the sphenoidal sinus can be identified between postmenstrual weeks 13 and 16 as an evagination of the posterior part of the nasal capsule, by full-term birth (notionally postmenstrual week 40) it represents an outgrowth of the spheno-ethmoidal recess. Pneumatization of the body of the sphenoid has been identified from 4 postnatal months and a distinct cell is visible by 2 years. Pneumatization spreads first into the presphenoid and later invades the postsphenoid part.

Anteriorly, the upper external surface shows an inconstant faint median ridge indicating the site of the fused symphysis menti. Inferiorly, this ridge divides to enclose a triangular mental protuberance; its base is centrally depressed but raised on each side as a mental tubercle. The mental protuberance and mental tubercles constitute the chin. The mental foramen, from which the mental neurovascular bundle emerges, lies midway between the upper and lower borders of the body, below either the interval between the premolar teeth, or the second premolar tooth. The posterior border of the foramen is smooth and accommodates the nerve as it emerges posterolaterally. A faint external oblique line ascends backwards from each mental tubercle and sweeps below the mental foramen, becoming more marked as it continues into the anterior border of the ramus.</div><div class="text" id="p0190">The lower border of the body, the base, extends posterolaterally from the mandibular symphysis into the lower border of the ramus behind the third molar tooth. The anterior belly of digastric is attached to a rough digastric fossa near the midline on each side. Behind the fossa, the base of the body is thick and rounded, with a slight anteroposterior convexity that changes to a gentle concavity as the ramus is approached, giving the base an overall sinuous profile.</div><div class="text" id="p0195">The upper border, the alveolar part, contains 16 alveoli for the roots of the lower teeth. It consists of buccal and lingual plates of bone joined by interdental and inter-radicular septa. Near the second and third molar teeth, the external oblique line is superimposed on the buccal plate. As is the case in the maxilla, the form and depth of the mandibular tooth sockets is related to the morphology of the roots of the mandibular teeth. The sockets of the incisor, canine and premolar teeth usually contain a single root, while those for the three molar teeth each contain two or three roots. The third molar is variable in its position and root presentation: it may be impacted vertically, horizontally, mesially or distally, and its roots may be bulbous, hooked, divergent or convergent, and occasionally embrace the mandibular (inferior dental) canal. The internal surface of the mandible is divided by an oblique mylohyoid line that gives attachment to mylohyoid and, above its posterior end, to the superior pharyngeal constrictor, some retromolar fascicles of buccinator, and the pterygomandibular raphe behind the third molar. The mylohyoid line extends from a point approximately 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm from the upper border behind the third molar as far forwards as the mental symphysis; it is sharp and distinct near the molars but faint further forwards. The mylohyoid groove extends downwards and forwards from the ramus below the posterior part of the mylohyoid line and contains the mylohyoid neurovascular bundle. The area below the line is a slightly concave submandibular fossa and is related to the submandibular gland. <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="668" id="pagebreak_668"/><a id="pg667.e1"/>The area above the line widens anteriorly into a triangular sublingual fossa and is related to the sublingual gland; the bone is covered by mucosa above the sublingual fossa as far back as the third molar. In an edentulous subject, it may be necessary to reduce any ridge-like prominence of the mylohyoid line so that dentures can fit without traumatizing the overlying oral mucosa.</div><div class="text" id="p0200">Above the anterior ends of the mylohyoid lines, the posterior symphysial aspect bears a small elevation that is often divided into upper and lower parts, the mental spines (genial tubercles). The spines are sometimes fused to form a single eminence, or they may be absent, in which case their position is indicated merely by an irregularity of the surface. Genioglossus is attached to the upper part, and geniohyoid is attached to the lower part. Midline lingual (genial) foramina, above and/or below the genial tubercles, and lateral lingual foramina in the premolar region are present in most mandibles and are of importance in the vascular supply to the symphysis. A rounded elevation of compact bone, the torus mandibularis, sometimes develops above the mylohyoid line; it is most prominent in the premolar region, is usually bilateral and only of clinical significance if repeatedly traumatized.</div></section><section><a id="s0115"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0115">Ramus</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0205">The mandibular ramus is quadrilateral. It has two surfaces (lateral and medial), four borders (superior, inferior, anterior and posterior) and two processes (coronoid and condylar). The lateral surface is relatively featureless and bears the (external) oblique ridge in its lower part. On the medial surface, the mandibular foramen lies midway between the anterior and posterior borders of the ramus, about level with the occlusal surfaces of the teeth. The inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle passes through the foramen to gain access to the mandibular canal. The foramen is overlapped anteromedially by a thin, sharp, triangular spine, the lingula, to which the sphenomandibular ligament is attached, and which is the landmark for an inferior alveolar local anaesthetic block injection. There is often a small prominence on the lateral surface of the ramus level with the lingula that forms a guide during surgical exposure of the lateral surface for osteotomies of the vertical ramus. Below and behind the foramen, the mylohyoid groove runs obliquely downwards and forwards.</div><div class="text" id="p0210">The inferior border is continuous with the mandibular base and meets the posterior border at the angle, which is typically everted in males but frequently inverted in females. The thin superior border bounds the mandibular incisure (sigmoid or mandibular notch, incisura semilunaris), which is surmounted in front by the somewhat triangular, flat coronoid process and behind by the condylar process. The thick, rounded posterior border extends from the condyle to the angle, and is gently convex backwards above and concave below. The anterior border is thin above, where it is continuous with the edge of the coronoid process, and thicker below, where it is continuous with the external oblique line. The temporal crest is a ridge that descends on the medial side of the coronoid process from its tip to the bone just behind the third molar tooth. The triangular depression between the temporal crest and the anterior border of the ramus is the retromolar fossa (retromolar trigone).</div><div class="text" id="p0215">The ramus and its processes provide attachment for the four primary muscles of mastication: masseter to the lateral surface; medial pterygoid to the medial surface; temporalis to the coronoid process and anterior ramus; the inferior head of lateral pterygoid to the condyle. The thickness of the ramus decreases markedly behind the external oblique line laterally, the temporal crest medially, and above the lingual, and there may be fusion of the lateral and medial cortical plates. This is of importance in mandibular ramus osteotomies and also influences the frequency of fractures of the mandibular angle.</div><section><a id="s0120"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0120">Antilingula</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0240">The term ‘antilingula’ has been used to describe an inconstant bony prominence on the lateral aspect of the ramus. This localized bulge, initially thought to be the result of the entrance of the inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle into the medial ramus, has been used as a guide to the position of the mandibular foramen in mandibular osteotomies. However, there is little correlation between the position of the antilingula and the mandibular foramen. It has been suggested that the prominence (when present) on the lateral ramus could reflect the insertion of fibres of masseter (<a href="#bib49" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_49">Lang 1995</a>, <a href="#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_38">Hogan and Ellis 2006</a>, <a href="#bib70" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_70">Park et al 2014</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0125"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0125">Mandibular canal</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0225">The mandibular foramen leads into the mandibular canal, which runs downwards and forwards within the ramus, gently curving inferiorly within the body under the roots of the molar teeth, with which it communicates by small openings, and ascending in the premolar region to the mental foramen. The canal is not always easy to define on plain X-rays, especially anterior to the mental foramen. Its walls may be formed either by a thin layer of cortical bone or, more frequently, by trabecular bone. Although the buccal–lingual and superior–inferior positions of the canal vary considerably between mandibles, in general, the mandibular canal is situated nearer the lingual cortical plate in the posterior two-thirds of the bone, and closer to the labial cortical plate in the anterior third. Bilateral symmetry (location of the canal in each half of the mandible) is reported to be common. Near the mental foramen, the inferior alveolar nerve branches into the mental nerve, which ultimately leaves the mandible via the mental foramen, and the incisive nerve, which remains within the bone and supplies the anterior teeth. The mental nerve may extend anteriorly for 2–3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm within the mandible before curving back to the mental foramen (the ‘anterior loop’ of the mental nerve).

The slender neck of the condyle expands transversely upwards and joins the ramus to the articular head.

Each half is ossified from a centre that appears near the mental foramen between postfertilization days 42 and 50. From this site, ossification spreads medially and posterocranially to form the body and ramus, first below, and then around, the inferior alveolar nerve and its incisive branch. Ossification then spreads upwards, initially forming a trough, and later crypts, for the developing teeth. From postmenstrual week 10, Meckel’s cartilage below the incisor rudiments is surrounded and invaded by bone. The mandibular condyle and coronoid process do not develop from the primary (Meckel’s) cartilage but from secondary cartilages that appear later (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 38.6</span></a>). A conical mass, the condylar cartilage, extends from the mandibular head downwards and forwards in the ramus, and contributes to its growth in height. Although it is largely replaced by bone by midfetal life, its proximal end persists as proliferating cartilage under the fibrous articular lining until about the third decade. Another secondary cartilage, which soon ossifies, appears along the anterior coronoid border, and disappears before birth. One or two cartilaginous nodules also occur at the symphysis menti. These may ossify as variable mental ossicles in symphysial fibrous tissue between postmenstrual weeks 25 and 28; they unite with adjacent bone before the end of the first postnatal year.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0025"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000380/main.assets/f38-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0025"/><a id="fspara0025"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 38.6</span> The left half of a mandible of a human embryo, 95<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm long. <span class="bold">A</span>, Lateral aspect. <span class="bold">B</span>, Medial aspect.

Until fusion occurs, new cells are added to each cartilage from symphysial fibrous tissue, and ossification on its mandibular side proceeds towards the midline. When the latter process overtakes the former and ossification extends into median fibrous tissue, the symphysis fuses. At this stage, the body is a mere shell, which encloses the imperfectly separated sockets of deciduous teeth. The mandibular canal is near the lower border, and the mental foramen opens below the first deciduous molar and is directed forwards. The condyle is almost in line with the occlusal plane of the mandible and the coronoid projects above the condyle. During the first three postnatal years, the two halves join at their symphysis from below upwards, although separation near the alveolar margin may persist into the second year. The body elongates, especially behind the mental foramen, providing space for three additional teeth.

Increase in length of the mandible is accomplished by deposition of bone on the posterior surface of the ramus and concomitant compensatory resorption on the anterior surface (accompanied by deposition of bone on the posterior surface of the coronoid process and resorption on the anterior surface of the condylar process); a part of the ramus is therefore modelled into an addition to the mandibular body. Increase in width of the mandible is produced by deposition of bone on the outer surface of the mandible and resorption on the inner surface. An increase in the comparative size of the ramus compared with the body of the mandible occurs during postnatal growth and tooth eruption.</div><div class="text" id="p0295">The role of the condylar cartilages in mandibular growth remains controversial. One view suggests that continued proliferation of this cartilage is primarily responsible for the increase in both the mandibular length and the height of the ramus. Alternatively, there is persuasive experimental evidence that proliferation of the condylar cartilage is an adaptive response to function, rather than being genetically determined. Condylar growth and remodelling have been shown to be influenced significantly by local factors – notably, movement and loading of the temporomandibular joint – and to be relatively immune to systemic influences such as vitamin C and D deficiency. Considering the changes that occur in the dentition throughout life, continuous adaptation of the temporomandibular articulation is required in order to maintain functional occlusal alignment between the upper and lower arches of teeth; this adaptation is thought to be largely the result of ongoing condylar remodelling.</div><div class="text" id="p0300">In adults, alveolar and subalveolar regions are about equal in depth, and the mental foramen appears midway between the upper and lower borders.

It contains temporalis, masseter, medial and lateral pterygoid, the ramus and coronoid process of the mandible, the mandibular nerve and otic ganglion, the maxillary artery and the pterygoid venous plexus, and part of the buccal fat pad anterolaterally. The masticator space is closed posteriorly by the attachment of the deep cervical fascia, medial pterygoid and masseter (pterygomasseteric sling), and anteriorly, lateral to the ramus, by the firm attachment of masseter (the submasseteric space is a ‘potential’ space). Above the level of the zygomatic arch, the temporal fascia provides both the superior and lateral limits, by its attachments to the superior temporal line and the zygomatic arch, respectively. Below the zygomatic arch, the investing layer of deep cervical fascia (superficial layer of deep cervical fascia) splits into two laminae to enclose masseter, the lower part of temporalis and medial pterygoid, further defining the boundaries of the masticator space. The superficial (lateral) lamina covers masseter and is attached to the zygomatic arch, and the deep (medial) lamina runs on the deep surface of medial pterygoid, attaching to the skull base medial to the foramen ovale (<a href="#bib32" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_32">Guidera et al 2014</a>). This fascial covering of the masticatory muscles is considered to be distinct from the parotid fascia (capsule). The superficial temporal space lies between the temporal fascia laterally and temporalis medially. The deep temporal space, like the submasseteric space, is a ‘potential’ space between temporalis laterally and the temporal fossa of the skull medially. Both spaces are in communication with the remainder of the masticator space inferiorly. There is a view that the upper limit of the masticator space should be at the level of the zygomatic arch, on the grounds that since both temporal spaces communicate with the remainder of the masticator space, a single masticator space incorporates the temporal fascia, muscles and temporal spaces. Medial to the ramus of the mandible, the pterygomandibular space (part of the masticator space) communicates freely with the pterygopalatine fossa, offering little resistance to the spread of infection or tumours. Posteriorly penetrating maxillary tumours directly involve the masticator space/infratemporal fossa and the pterygopalatine fossa.

It is unusual in that its articular surfaces are lined by fibrocartilage, rather than by hyaline cartilage: fibrocartilage is less susceptible to degeneration and has a greater repair capacity. The joint cavity is divided into upper and lower compartments (‘spaces’) by a fibrocartilaginous articular disc.</div><div class="text" id="p0370">The anterior limit of the glenoid fossa is the articular eminence. This transverse ridge of dense bone, tilted down at an angle of approximately 25° to the occlusal plane, forms most of the articular surface of the mandibular fossa. It is strongly convex in the sagittal plane with a slight concavity in the coronal plane and extends out laterally to the zygomatic arch as the articular tubercle. The articular eminence may contain air cells from the mastoid in around 5% of cases on CT scan (<a href="#bib48" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_48">Ladeira et al 2013</a>), which may be clinically relevant when the eminence is surgically reduced or screws are placed for fixation.

The squamotympanic fissure marks the junction with the posterior non-articular (tympanic) area. The tegmen tympani, a bony plate of the petrous temporal, intervenes in the medial aspect of the fissure, where the squamotympanic fissure becomes the petrotympanic fissure. The postglenoid tubercle at the root of the zygomatic arch, just anterior to the squamotympanic fissure, separates the squamotympanic fissure laterally from the tympanic plate.</div><div class="text" id="p0380">The condylar head, tilted forwards on the neck at an angle of approximately 30° (physiological anteversion), articulates with the fossa on its anterior and superior surfaces.

The posterior band is the thickest. Its upper surface is concavo-convex where it fits against the convex articular eminence and the concavity of the articular fossa. Posteriorly, the disc is attached to a richly vascularized and innervated region, the bilaminar zone (posterior attachment), that splits into two laminae: unlike the rest of the disc, its normal function is to provide attachment rather than intra-articular support. The upper lamina is composed of fibroelastic tissue and is attached to the squamotympanic fissure. A condensation of elastic fibres in the medial portion of the upper lamina is visible as the posterior oblique protuberance on arthroscopy (see Video 38.1). The lower lamina is composed of fibrous non-elastic tissue and is attached to the posterior aspect of the condyle. The intervening connective tissue between the upper and lower laminae contains a vascular plexus and is well innervated, but the central part of the disc itself is avascular and not innervated. With anterior movement of the disc–condyle complex, the volume of the posterior attachment increases as a result of the negative pressures generated, resulting in an influx of blood into the venous plexus: this pumping mechanism is important in the nutrition of the joint (<a href="#bib82" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_82">Stegenga and de Bont 2006</a>).</div><section><a id="s0240"/><section><a id="s0245"/><h4 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0235">Upper and lower joint compartments</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0445">The upper joint space contains approximately 1.2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>ml of synovial fluid and the lower approximately 0.9<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>ml.

Wear of the articular surfaces may be reduced by the presence of a deformable articular disc, which not only distributes compressive joint loading over a larger contact area but also significantly reduces the frictional force on the condyle and the articular fossa by separating slide and rotation into different joint compartments.</div><div class="text" id="p0460">The disc may aid joint lubrication by storing fluid squeezed out from loaded areas to create a weeping lubricant. Its flexibility, due to its high water content and viscoelastic properties, allows it to function almost like a fluid, further reducing friction within the joint and so aiding joint lubrication. The friction between the articulating surfaces in the absence of the disc is 2–3 times greater than with the disc <span class="italic">in situ</span>.</div><div class="text" id="p0465">The role of the disc in relation to joint stability is controversial. One view is that a deformable and viscoelastic disc stabilizes the condyle within the joint by filling the changing and irregular joint space created during movement. The disc moves in an almost congruent manner relative to the condyle controlled by neuromuscular forces: the upper head of <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="674" id="pagebreak_674"/><a id="pg673.e1"/>lateral pterygoid anteriorly and the elastic tissue in the bilaminar region posteriorly together pull the disc forwards or backwards and the shape of the disc with its thick, ‘self-seating’ anulus helps to prevent it sliding off the condyle. An alternative view is that a slippery articular disc doubles the number of virtually friction-free sliding surfaces, and so destabilizes the condyle in the same way that stepping on a slippery object destabilizes the foot. These two roles are not mutually exclusive. A deformable disc stabilizes the condyle within the joint whilst, by doubling the friction-free surfaces, the disc–condyle assembly slides freely under compressive loading and so is ‘destabilized’.</div><div class="text" id="p0470">The articular disc is designed to withstand compressive and shearing loads. It has viscoelastic properties that allow it to deform when loaded and to conform to the surfaces causing this deformation. Removal of the disc increases surface friction within the joint by 2–3 times compared to joints with an intact disc. Long-term follow-up of patients who have had the disc removed (‘discectomy’) demonstrates that the joint undergoes significant remodelling similar to that seen in osteoarthrosis. There is flattening, slight roughening and sclerosis of the condylar head and articular fossa. These changes, which are believed to be adaptive responses of the condyle and fossa to the absence of an intervening disc, collectively produce a broader contact, decreasing the load per unit area. A layer of fibrous tissue (scar) also forms between the surfaces and synovial tissue may reform over this area providing a ‘neo-disc’.</div><div class="text" id="p0475">The main purpose of collagen in tissue is to resist tensile forces. The orientation of the collagen fibres in the disc varies in the individual regions, reflecting the direction of the tensile forces imparted to the disc. In the intermediate zone, these fibres are predominantly orientated in an anteroposterior direction. Around the periphery, they form a ring-like structure with a three-dimensional framework of fibrils. In the posterior and anterior bands, their predominant orientation is lateral–medial and superior–inferior. Type 1 collagen, similar to that found in the superficial layers of the head of the condyle and the articular fossa, predominates in the disc.</div><div class="text" id="p0480">Chondroitin sulphate and dermatan sulphate are the principal glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the intercellular matrix.

This bony partition is occasionally fenestrated by inflammatory processes or inadvertently during surgery to the joint, particularly for release of ankylosis, and, rarely, by the condyle being driven superiorly by violent trauma to the mandible. The foramen of Hushke (a tympanic foramen found in some 4% of cadaveric dissections) may communicate directly with the middle cranial fossa or middle ear (<a href="#bib42" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_42">Lacout et al 2005</a>).

The nerve supply to the temporomandibular joint is from branches from the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, mostly through the auriculotemporal branch, and branches from the masseteric and deep temporal nerves. Postganglionic sympathetic nerves supply the tissues associated with the capsular ligament and the looser posterior bilaminar extension of the disc. The temporomandibular joint capsule, lateral ligament and retroarticular tissues all contain mechanoreceptors and nociceptors: the input from mechanoreceptors provides a source of proprioceptive sensation that helps control mandibular posture and movement.</div></section><section><a id="s0265"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0255">Jaw movements</h3><section><a id="s0270"/><section><a id="s0275"/><h4 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0260">Movements of the condyle in the temporomandibular joint</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0500">The major function of the mandible is to exert, via the teeth, the force necessary to break down food into smaller particles and so facilitate digestion. Pure vertical movements of the lower teeth create a crushing force that is ineffective in breaking up tough fibrous food. Humans use a lateral movement of the lower jaw to create a shear force that enhances the effectiveness of the power stroke of mastication. Bodily lateral movement of the whole jaw, the Bennett shift, is insignificant. Extensive lateral movement is only possible when the jaw is rotated horizontally about one condyle while the other condyle slides backwards and forwards. The temporomandibular joint is structurally adapted to accommodate both sliding/translation and rotation/hinging in a sagittal plane. Sliding/translation occurs because the capsular ligament that surrounds the upper joint compartment is loose, whereas the capsular ligament that encloses the lower joint compartment is tight, and only allows the condyle to rotate over the depression inside the anulus of the articular disc. The normal range of maximum mouth opening measured between the upper and lower incisor tips is 35–50<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm, the first 15–25<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm of which is due to hinging of the condyle; the remainder is due to condylar translation. The adult range of movements is reached at around 10 years in females and 15 years in males. Lateral excursions of the chin (including protrusion) can normally achieve 8–12<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm of movement at the lower incisors. At the limit of normal opening, the condyle has translated on to the peak or just beyond the peak of the articular eminence. Translation beyond this results in subluxation (temporary) and dislocation (longer standing) of the joint, when the condyle lies anterior and superior to the peak of the articular eminence.</div></section><section><a id="s0280"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0265">Symmetric opening</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0505">Symmetric jaw opening is associated with preparation for incising. At the start, each mandibular condyle rotates in the lower joint compartment inside the anulus of its disc. After a few degrees of opening, the condyle continues rotating inside its disc and, in addition, both slide forwards down the articular eminence of the upper joint compartment. Without this forward slide or translation, it becomes impossible to continue opening the jaw beyond a gape of approximately 25<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm.</div><div class="text" id="p0510">Opinions differ as to why this forward slide should occur. A cadaveric condyle slides forwards when the jaw is rotated open, suggesting that this is not a neuromuscular response but rather the result of mechanical constraints. When the jaw is rotated open, the temporomandibular ligament rapidly becomes taut (<a href="#bib68" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Osborn 1995</a>). The taut ligament acts as a constraint that allows the mandible only two rotary movements: it can swing about the upper attachment of the ligament and rotate about the lower attachment. The lower end of the taut ligament acts as a moving fulcrum that converts the downward and backward pull of the opening rotary force (created at the front by digastric and geniohyoid) into one that drives the condyle upwards and forwards into the concavity of the overlying articular disc. This now pushes the disc forward. Swing about the upper attachment creates space above for the disc to slide further forwards, which is possible because the upper part of the capsular ligament is loose. The two movements, rotation and swing, are inextricably linked by the taut ligament and, via the condyle, combine to keep the disc in firm contact with the articular eminence while the jaw is opened. The disc is stabilized by its tight attachment to the condyle (collateral ligament) and by the thickened margins of its anulus that prevent it sliding through the thinner compressed region between the centre of the condyle and the articular eminence.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="675" id="pagebreak_675"/><a id="pg674.e1"/></div><div class="text" id="p0515">As forward slide of the condyle continues, the controlling influence exerted by the temporomandibular ligament diminishes. The lingula of the mandible moves away from the spine of the sphenoid, tautening the originally slack sphenomandibular ligament, which now acts in the same way as the temporomandibular ligament, to maintain the condyle against the articular eminence. Symmetric opening thus appears to consist of at least three separate phases: an early phase controlled by the temporomandibular ligament and articular eminence; a short middle phase in which either both temporomandibular and sphenomandibular ligaments, or neither, act to constrain movements; and a late phase controlled by the sphenomandibular ligament and articular eminence.</div></section><section><a id="s0285"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0270">Changes in disc position during movement</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0520">With the teeth in occlusion, the condyle is in the glenoid fossa and the intra-articular disc sits on the condylar head, with its posterior band at the 12 o’clock position from the centre of the condylar head in the sagittal plane (<a href="#f0050"><span class="bold">Fig. 38.16A</span></a>). As mouth opening begins (<a href="#f0050"><span class="bold">Fig. 38.16B</span></a>), the condyle rotates within the lower joint space and the disc remains stationary. At about mid-opening, the condyle and disc begin to move forwards together so that their relative position is maintained (<a href="#f0050"><span class="bold">Fig. 38.16C</span></a>). At maximum gape (<a href="#f0050"><span class="bold">Fig. 38.16D</span></a>), the condylar head slides further anteriorly than the disc and the disc is rotated backwards relative to the condyle by the pull of the elastic superior lamina of the posterior attachment, so that the anterior band of the articular disc is above the summit of the condyle. This differential movement results in the disc moving only about half the distance of the condyle. Mouth closure involves the disc moving back in tandem with the condyle under the influence of the elastic fibres in the upper lamina of the bilaminar area posterior to the disc itself (<a href="#f0050"><span class="bold">Fig. 38.16E</span></a>), which also reverses its angular rotation (<a href="#f0050"><span class="bold">Fig. 38.16F</span></a>) to resume the starting position of the cycle.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0050"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000380/main.assets/f38-09-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0050"/><a id="fspara0050"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 38.16</span> Changing relationships of the condyle of the mandible, the articular disc and the articular surface of the temporal bone during one complete opening (A → D) and closing (D → A) cycle of the mouth.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0525">Changes in disc position may become out of phase with the condyle, causing obstruction to smooth mandibular movement. The disc is typically pulled anteromedially by lateral pterygoid, preventing forward translation of the condyle. With the disc in this position, the posterior band of the disc is anterior to the condyle, obstructing forward translation of the condyle. As the force from the condyle on the disc increases, the elastic posterior attachments of the disc are stretched until the resistance to movement is overcome and the disc reduces into a normal relationship with the condyle, a movement that is associated with an audible click (audible to the patient and occasionally to others). Once the normal disc–condyle relation is re-established, the mouth is free to achieve maximum opening (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 38.16C,D</a>). The disc may then snap back anterior to the condyle on mouth closure. This phenomenon is called reciprocal clicking or disc displacement with reduction. If the disc remains completely anterior to the condylar head and does not reduce into a normal relationship with the condyle during opening, the condyle may be prevented from further forward translation and mouth opening is restricted. This common clinical condition is known as disc displacement without reduction.</div></section><section><a id="s0290"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0275">Eccentric jaw opening</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0530">Jaw movement during mastication can be divided into three parts: opening, closing and power strokes. Eccentric jaw opening is associated with preparing for the power stroke of mastication. The mandibular condyle on the non-working side slides back and forth during lateral movements associated with the power stroke on the working side. Although the jaw muscles now have the major control over mandibular movements, the temporomandibular and sphenomandibular ligaments keep the condyle firmly against its articular eminence during opening.</div></section><section><a id="s0295"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0280">Eccentric and symmetric jaw closing</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0535">During closure of the jaw, the masticatory muscles act in combination to force the joint surfaces together. This compresses the joint tissues and potentially shortens the ligaments so that they no longer constrain jaw movements. Under these conditions, jaw movements and the positions of the condyles are controlled by neuromuscular processes, within the limits of constraints imposed by the articular eminence, the occluding surfaces of the teeth and the presence of food between them. The non-working condyle moves the furthest, and is the most heavily loaded, during the power stroke of mastication.

If conscious effort is used, a closure path can then be followed in which the jaw is closed to an extreme protruded tooth contact position, after which it has to be retruded to the starting position. Similar considerations apply to lateral movements: mandibular rotation around a retruding condyle and the protraction of the opposite condyle are anatomically limiting factors that are rarely encountered in normal function.</div><div class="text" id="p0550">Although all mandibular movement occurs within or along the border movements, knowledge of the extent of border movements provides little information on the nature of the movements during chewing or on the free (‘empty’), habitual movements during both opening and closing, that have a more limited trajectory.</div></section><section><a id="s0305"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0290">Disc position and internal derangement</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0560">Abnormalities of disc position (collectively known as internal derangements) can be a cause of joint noises (clicking), limitation of jaw movement and/or pain. The position of the disc is considered to be normal when, with the mandible at rest, the posterior band is positioned in the 12 o’clock position from the centre of the condyle in the sagittal plane. Displacement of the disc anteromedially is most common. MRI and arthrography have demonstrated that, although disc position and clinical symptoms are often linked, a significant proportion of subjects with apparently normal temporomandibular joint function have disc displacement on imaging and, conversely, patients with normally positioned discs may have severe restriction of mouth opening. Similarly, individuals with displaced discs who have undergone disc repositioning surgery often show functional improvement despite persistent displacement of their intra-articular disc and vice versa. Limited mouth opening is not always related to disc displacement or non-reducibility but may be the result of impaired joint lubrication, disc mobility and muscle spasm.

Its fibres pass downwards and backwards and are attached to the angle and lower posterior half of the lateral surface of the mandibular ramus. The superficial fibres are angled approximately 10° from the vertical, as is visible in lean individuals. In the coronal (frontal) plane, the muscle forms a 10° angle with the mandibular ramus. Intramuscular tendinous septa in this layer are responsible for the ridges on the surface of the ramus.

There is still debate as to whether fibres of masseter are attached to the anterolateral part of the articular disc of the temporomandibular joint. Hypertrophy of the masseter may present either unilaterally or bilaterally. The aetiology is uncertain, but may be related to a clenching habit; there may be an associated prominence of the mandibular angle.

Its fibres converge and descend into a tendon that passes through the gap between the zygomatic arch and the side of the skull anterior and medial to the articular eminence. A plane exists beneath the temporal fascia attached to the superior surface of the zygomatic arch, and the muscle passing beneath the arch. An elevator introduced into this plane through an incision above the hairline may therefore be placed beneath a fractured zygomatic arch or bone in order to reduce the fracture (Gillies approach). Temporalis is attached to the medial surface, apex, anterior and posterior borders of the coronoid process and to the anterior border of the mandibular ramus almost up to the third molar tooth. Its anterior fibres are orientated vertically, the most posterior fibres almost horizontally, and the intervening fibres with intermediate degrees of obliquity, in the manner of a fan. Fibres of temporalis may occasionally gain attachment to the articular disc. Though less common than enlargement of masseter, hypertrophy of temporalis may develop unilaterally or bilaterally, producing prominence of the temporal fossa, which may be considered unsightly; botulinum toxin injections to prevent function of the motor end plates of the muscle fibres is the preferred treatment for this condition.</div><section><a id="s0370"/><section><a id="s0375"/><section><a id="s0380"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0340">Relations</p><div class="textfl" id="p0615">Skin, auriculares anterior and superior, temporal fascia, superficial temporal vessels, the auriculotemporal nerve, temporal branches of the facial nerve, the zygomaticotemporal nerve, the epicranial aponeurosis, the zygomatic arch and masseter are all superficial relations.

The temporalis fascia can be incorporated with the flap. The muscle may be split longitudinally (along its long axis), retaining its axial supply from individual arteries: the vessels are identified at operation with Doppler ultrasound if necessary.

When left and right muscles contract together, the condyle is pulled forwards and slightly downwards. This protrusive movement alone has little or no function except to assist in opening the jaw. Digastric and geniohyoid are the main jaw opening muscles: unlike lateral pterygoid, when acting alone, they rotate the jaw open, provided other muscles attached to the hyoid prevent it from being pulled forwards. If only one lateral pterygoid contracts, the jaw rotates about a vertical axis passing roughly through the opposite condyle and is pulled medially towards the opposite side. This contraction, together with that of the adjacent medial pterygoid (both attached to the lateral pterygoid plate), provides most of the strong medially directed component of the force used when grinding food between teeth of the same side. It is arguably the most important function of the lower head of lateral pterygoid.</div><div class="text" id="p0675">It is often stated that the upper head is used to pull the articular disc forwards when the jaw is opened. However, electromyographic studies (e.g. <a href="#bib56" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_56">McNamara 1973</a>, <a href="#bib46" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_46">Juniper 1981</a>) have demonstrated that the upper and lower heads are reciprocally innervated, so that the lower head contracts during mouth opening whilst the upper head relaxes, the situation reversing during closure. An explanation for this surprising activity is as follows (<a href="#bib68" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Osborn 1995</a>). Most of the power of a clenching force is due to contractions of masseter and temporalis. The associated backward pull of temporalis is greater than the associated forward pull of (superficial) masseter, and so their combined jaw-closing action potentially pulls the condyle backwards. This is prevented by the simultaneous contraction of the upper head of lateral pterygoid, which stabilizes the condylar head against the articular eminence during closure, particularly during biting and mastication.</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0435"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0385">Medial pterygoid</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0680">Medial pterygoid is a thick, quadrilateral muscle with two heads (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 38.20</a>). Mirroring masseter (which lies laterally), its fibres descend posteroinferiorly at an angle of about 10° to the vertical. In the coronal plane, the muscle forms a 30° angle with the ramus. The major component is the deep head which arises from the medial surface of the lateral pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone and is therefore deep to the lower head of lateral pterygoid. The small, superficial head arises from the maxillary tuberosity and the pyramidal process of the palatine bone, and therefore lies on the lower head of lateral pterygoid. The fibres of medial pterygoid descend posterolaterally and are attached by a strong tendinous lamina to the posteroinferior part of the medial surface of the ramus and angle of the mandible, as high as the mandibular foramen and almost as far anteriorly as the mylohyoid groove. This area of attachment is often ridged. Inferior alveolar nerve block injection can occasionally cause haemorrhage into the muscle, which may give rise to painful trismus. Medial pterygoid and masseter act together to support the angle of the mandible as the pterygomasseteric sling: their strong muscle attachments resist lengthening of the mandibular ramus surgically.</div><section><a id="s0440"/><section><a id="s0445"/><section><a id="s0450"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0390">Relations</p><div class="textfl" id="p0685">The lateral surface of medial pterygoid is related to the mandibular ramus, from which it is separated above its insertion by lateral pterygoid, the sphenomandibular ligament, the maxillary artery, the inferior alveolar vessels and nerve, the lingual nerve and a process of the parotid gland.

The motor branches innervate the muscles of mastication. The large sensory root emerges from the lateral part of the trigeminal ganglion and exits the cranial cavity through the foramen ovale. The small motor root passes under the ganglion and through the foramen ovale to unite with the sensory root just outside the skull.

The mandibular nerve immediately passes between tensor veli palatini medially, and lateral pterygoid laterally, and gives off a meningeal branch and the nerve to medial pterygoid from its medial side. The nerve then divides into a small anterior and large posterior trunk. The anterior division gives off branches to the four main muscles of mastication and a buccal branch that is sensory to the cheek.

Near its junction with the trigeminal motor root, the mandibular nerve lies lateral to the ganglion, tensor veli palatini lies medially, separating the ganglion from the cartilaginous part of the pharyngotympanic tube, and the middle meningeal artery is posterior to the ganglion. The otic ganglion usually surrounds the origin of the nerve to medial pterygoid. It has three roots, parasympathetic motor, sympathetic and sensory: only the parasympathetic fibres relay in the ganglion (see <a href="../B9780702077050000331/B9780702077050000331.xhtml#f0050">Fig. 33.7</a>). The parasympathetic fibres arise from cell bodies in the inferior salivatory nucleus and travel in the lesser petrosal branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve. The lesser petrosal nerve runs intracranially in the middle cranial fossa on the anterior surface of the petrous temporal bone and passes through either the foramen ovale or the sphenopetrosal fissure or the innominate canal of Arnold (a canal in the greater wing of the sphenoid close to the foramen spinosum), to join the otic ganglion where it synapses. Postganglionic fibres pass by a communicating branch to the auriculotemporal nerve to reach the parotid gland. The sympathetic root arises from a plexus on the middle meningeal artery. It contains postganglionic vasomotor fibres from the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion that pass through the otic ganglion and join the parasympathetic fibres to travel via the auriculotemporal nerve to the parotid gland.

In contrast, a pericoronitis that affects a mandibular third molar tooth that communicates with the oral cavity, or, less commonly, either a dental abscess associated with this tooth, or a postoperative infection, can spread along tissue planes. Spread may be buccal, submandibular, submental, parapharyngeal, sublingual, or less commonly, submasseteric and, rarely, infratemporal. The main symptom caused by infection of the pterygomandibular space is trismus (painful reflex muscle spasm) that usually affects medial pterygoid. There are few anatomical barriers to the spread of infection from this space. When the submandibular, sublingual and submental areas are affected either unilaterally or bilaterally (bilateral involvement is known as Ludwig’s angina), there is a risk of airway obstruction. Infection may (potentially) spread further, usually to the parapharyngeal, and occasionally to the retropharyngeal spaces, with the possibility of spread into the mediastinum inferiorly. Superior spread can even reach the orbit via the inferior orbital fissure. Life-threatening cavernous sinus thrombosis is a remote possibility once infection has spread to the orbit, with further spread directly through the superior orbital fissure into the cranial cavity.
