They form a rich network within platysma and in the subdermal plexus, which accounts for the viability of the various skin flaps raised during neck dissection, irrespective of whether or not platysma is included. Great care must be taken in their design to avoid three-point junctions especially if the area has been irradiated previously or is infected, when its viability can be compromised.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">The anterior cervical skin is supplied mainly by the superior thyroid artery and the transverse cervical branch of the subclavian artery. The posterior skin is supplied by branches from the occipital artery and the deep cervical and transverse cervical branches of the subclavian artery. The superior skin is supplied by the occipital artery and its upper sternocleidomastoid branch, and the submandibular and submental branches of the facial artery. Inferiorly, the skin is supplied by the transverse cervical and/or suprascapular branches of the subclavian artery.</div><div class="text" id="p0030">The pattern of venous drainage of the skin of the neck mirrors the arterial supply: the veins drain into the jugular and facial veins. The profuse blood supply to the facial and neck skin facilitates the design of random flaps, which can often be made larger in this region than elsewhere.</div><div class="text" id="p0035">Many lymphatic vessels draining the superficial cervical tissues skirt the borders of sternocleidomastoid to reach the superior or inferior deep cervical nodes. Some pass over sternocleidomastoid and the posterior triangle to drain into the superficial cervical and occipital nodes (see <a href="#f0080">Fig. 35.15</a>). Lymph from the superior region of the anterior triangle drains to the submandibular and submental nodes. Vessels from the anterior cervical skin inferior to the hyoid bone pass to the anterior cervical lymph nodes near the anterior jugular veins, and their efferents go to the deep cervical nodes of both sides, including the infrahyoid, prelaryngeal and pretracheal groups (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 35.1A</span></a>).

The dorsal rami supply skin over the back of the neck and scalp, and the ventral rami supply skin covering the lateral and anterior portions of the neck, and the angle of the mandible (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 35.1B</span></a>). The dorsal rami of the first, sixth, seventh and eighth cervical nerves have no cutaneous distribution in the neck. The greater occipital nerve mainly supplies the scalp; it comes from the medial branch of the dorsal ramus of the second cervical nerve. The medial branches of the dorsal rami of the third, fourth and fifth cervical nerves pierce trapezius to supply skin over the back of the neck sequentially. The ventral rami of the second, third and fourth cervical nerves supply named cutaneous branches (the lesser occipital, great auricular, transverse cutaneous and supraclavicular nerves), via the cervical plexus (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 35.1B</a>) (see <a href="#pg595">p. 595</a> for details of the motor branches of the cervical plexus).</div><section><a id="s0030"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0025">Lesser occipital nerve</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0045">The lesser occipital nerve is derived mainly from the second cervical nerve (although fibres from the third cervical nerve may sometimes contribute). It first passes anterior to the plane of the accessory nerve (spinal accessory nerve) before winding around it and becoming anterior to it. It next ascends along the posterior margin of sternocleidomastoid. Near the cranium it perforates the deep fascia and passes up on to the scalp behind the auricle to supply the skin and connect with the great auricular and greater occipital nerves and the auricular branch of the facial nerve. Its auricular branch supplies the skin on the upper third of the medial aspect of the auricle and connects with the posterior branch of the great auricular nerve. The auricular branch is occasionally derived from the greater occipital nerve. It has been suggested that compression or stretching of the lesser occipital nerve contributes to cervicogenic headache (<a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355_split_a.xhtml#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Lucas et al 1994</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0030">Great auricular nerve</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0050">The great auricular nerve is the largest ascending branch of the cervical plexus. It arises from the second and third cervical rami, encircles the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid, perforates the deep fascia and ascends on the muscle beneath platysma with the external jugular vein. On reaching the parotid gland, it divides into anterior and posterior branches. The anterior branch is distributed to the facial skin over the parotid gland and connects in the gland with the facial nerve. This cross-innervation between somatic sensory supply (great auricular) and parasympathetic secretomotor fibres to the parotid is considered to be part of the anatomical basis for the phenomenon of gustatory sweating (Frey's syndrome), seen after parotidectomy with its inherent disruption of the secretomotor nerve supply. The posterior branch supplies the skin over the mastoid process and on the back of the auricle (except its upper part); a filament pierces the auricle to reach the lateral surface, where it is distributed to the lobule and concha. Efforts are made to preserve the posterior branch at parotid surgery in order to avoid a sensory deficit of the pinna. The posterior branch communicates with the lesser occipital nerve, the auricular branch of the vagus and the posterior auricular branch of the facial nerve. Division of the greater auricular nerve during neck surgery results in loss of sensation of a variable amount of the lower half of the auricle, which some patients initially find unpleasant.</div></section><section><a id="s0040"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0035">Transverse cervical cutaneous nerve</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0055">The transverse cervical cutaneous nerve arises from the second and third cervical rami. It curves round the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid near its midpoint and runs obliquely forwards, deep to the external jugular vein, to the anterior border of the muscle. It perforates the deep cervical fascia, and divides under platysma into ascending and descending branches that are distributed to the anterolateral areas of the neck. The ascending branches ascend to the submandibular region, forming a plexus with the cervical branch of the facial nerve beneath platysma. Some branches pierce platysma and are distributed to the skin of the upper anterior areas of the neck. The descending branches pierce platysma and are distributed anterolaterally to the skin of the neck, as low as the sternum.</div></section><section><a id="s0045"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0040">Supraclavicular nerves</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0060">The supraclavicular nerves arise from a common trunk formed from rami from the third and fourth cervical nerves and emerge at the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid. Descending under platysma and the deep cervical fascia, the trunk divides into medial, intermediate and lateral (posterior) branches, which diverge to pierce the deep fascia a little above the clavicle. The medial supraclavicular nerves run inferomedially across the external jugular vein and the clavicular and sternal heads of sternocleidomastoid to supply the skin as far as the midline and as low as the second rib. They also supply the sternoclavicular joint. The intermediate supraclavicular nerves cross the clavicle to supply the skin over pectoralis major and deltoid down to the level of the second rib, next to the area of supply of the second thoracic nerve. Overlap between these nerves is minimal. The lateral supraclavicular nerves descend superficially across trapezius and the acromion, supplying the skin of the upper and posterior parts of the shoulder.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="574" id="pagebreak_574"/><a id="pg574"/></div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0050"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0045">Bones, Joints and Cartilages</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0065">The bones and cartilages of the neck are the cervical vertebrae and the hyoid bone, and the cartilages of the upper respiratory tract, including the larynx.

A vertical median ridge often bisects the upper part of the body but rarely extends to the lower part. The posterior surface is smooth and concave, faces posteroinferiorly, and is separated from the epiglottis by the thyrohyoid membrane and loose areolar tissue. There is a bursa between the hyoid bone and the membrane. Geniohyoid is attached to most of the anterior surface of the body, above and below the transverse ridge; the medial part of hyoglossus invades the lateral geniohyoid area. The lower anterior surface gives attachment to mylohyoid, the line of attachment lying above sternohyoid medially and omohyoid laterally. The lowest fibres of genioglossus, the hyoepiglottic ligament and (most posteriorly) the thyrohyoid membrane are all attached to the rounded superior border. Sternohyoid is attached to the inferior border medially and omohyoid is attached laterally.

Stylohyoid is attached near the junction of the cornu with the body. The fibrous loop for the digastric tendon is attached lateral and a little posterior to hyoglossus.

Chondrification is seen in embryos at stages 18–20 (42–50 postfertilization days). Ossification of the bone is seen after postmenstrual week 30. The body of the hyoid bone is ossified by postnatal month 4 and the greater cornua by postnatal month 6. Ossification proceeds from six centres, i.e. a pair for the body and one for each cornu. Ossification begins in the greater cornua towards the end of intrauterine life, in the body shortly before or after birth, and in the lesser cornua around puberty. The greater cornual apices remain cartilaginous until the third decade and epiphyses may occur here. They fuse with the body. Synovial joints between the greater and lesser cornua may be obliterated by ossification in later decades.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0080"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0075">Joints</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0110">The atlanto-occipital and atlanto-axial joints are described in <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml">Chapter 46</a>.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0085"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0090">Triangles of the Neck</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0115">Anterolaterally, the neck appears as a somewhat quadrilateral area, limited superiorly by the inferior border of the mandible and a line continued from the angle of the mandible to the mastoid process, inferiorly by the upper border of the clavicle, anteriorly by the anterior median line, and posteriorly by the anterior margin of trapezius.

It should be noted that the bulk of sternocleidomastoid is not included in the delineation of either the anterior or posterior triangles, even though the most important structures in the neck, the major vessels and lymph nodes of levels II, III and IV, lie deep to the muscle (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 35.3</a>). The base of the triangle is the inferior border of the mandible and its projection to the mastoid process, and the apex is at the manubrium sterni. The anterior triangle can be subdivided into suprahyoid and infrahyoid areas above and below the hyoid bone, and into digastric, submental, muscular and carotid triangles by the passage of digastric and omohyoid across the anterior triangle (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 35.3</a>). The lymphatic contents of both the anterior and posterior triangles can also be divided into levels I to V, facilitating radiological reporting as well as neck dissection terminology (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 35.3B</span></a>).<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="576" id="pagebreak_576"/><a id="pg576"/></div><section><a id="s0095"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle00990">Digastric triangle</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0125">The digastric triangle is bordered above by the lower border of the mandible and its projection to the mastoid process, posteroinferiorly by the posterior belly of digastric and by stylohyoid, and anteroinferiorly by the anterior belly of digastric. It is covered by the skin, superficial fascia, platysma and deep fascia, which contain branches of the facial and transverse cutaneous cervical nerves. Its floor is formed by mylohyoid and hyoglossus. The anterior region of the digastric triangle contains the submandibular gland, which has the facial vein superficial to it and the facial artery deep to it. The submental and mylohyoid arteries and nerves lie on mylohyoid. The submandibular lymph nodes are variably related to the submandibular gland. The posterior region of the digastric triangle contains the lower part of the parotid gland. The external carotid artery, passing deep to stylohyoid, curves above the muscle, and overlaps its superficial surface as it ascends deep to the parotid gland before entering it. The internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein and vagus nerve lie deeper and are separated from the external carotid artery by styloglossus, stylopharyngeus and the glossopharyngeal nerve.</div></section><section><a id="s0100"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0095">Submental triangle</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0130">The single submental triangle is demarcated by the anterior bellies of both digastric muscles.

In the living (except the obese), the triangle is usually a small visible triangular depression, sometimes best seen with the head and cervical vertebral column slightly extended and the head contralaterally rotated. The carotid triangle is covered by the skin, superficial fascia, platysma and deep fascia containing branches of the facial and cutaneous cervical nerves. The hyoid bone forms its anterior angle and adjacent floor; it can be located on simple inspection and verified by palpation. Parts of thyrohyoid, hyoglossus and inferior and middle pharyngeal constrictor muscles form its floor. The carotid triangle contains the upper part of the common carotid artery and its division into external and internal carotid arteries. Overlapped by the anterior margin of sternocleidomastoid, the external carotid artery is first anteromedial, then anterior to the internal carotid artery. Branches of the external carotid artery are encountered in the carotid triangle. The superior thyroid artery runs anteroinferiorly, the lingual artery anteriorly with a characteristic upward loop, the facial artery anterosuperiorly, the occipital artery posterosuperiorly and the ascending pharyngeal artery medial to the internal carotid artery. Arterial pulsation greets the examining finger. The superior thyroid, lingual, facial, ascending pharyngeal and sometimes the occipital veins correspond to the branches of the external carotid artery, and all drain into the internal jugular vein. The hypoglossal nerve crosses the external and internal carotid arteries. It curves round the origin of the lower sternocleidomastoid branch of the occipital artery, and at this point the superior root of the ansa cervicalis leaves it to descend anteriorly in the carotid sheath. The internal laryngeal nerve and, below it, the external laryngeal nerve lie medial to the external carotid artery below the hyoid bone. Many structures in this region, such as all or part of the internal jugular vein, associated deep cervical lymph nodes, and the vagus nerve, may be variably obscured by sternocleidomastoid, and, pedantically, are thus ‘outside the triangle’.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0115"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0110">Posterior triangle of the neck</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0145">The posterior triangle is delimited anteriorly by the posterior edge of sternocleidomastoid, posteriorly by the anterior edge of trapezius, and inferiorly by the middle third of the clavicle (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 35.3</a>). Its apex is between the attachments of sternocleidomastoid and trapezius to the occiput and is often blunted, so that the ‘triangle’ becomes quadrilateral. The roof of the posterior triangle is formed by the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia. The floor of the triangle is formed by the prevertebral fascia overlying splenius capitis, levator scapulae and the scalene muscles.

The triangle is covered by skin, superficial and deep fasciae, and inferiorly by platysma. The accessory nerve pierces sternocleidomastoid and crosses levator scapulae obliquely downwards and backwards to reach the deep surface of trapezius. The surface marking of its course is in a line from the junction of the superior third and inferior two-thirds of sternocleidomastoid, to the junction of the inferior third and superior two-thirds of trapezius. Cutaneous and muscular branches of the cervical plexus emerge at the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid.

Its floor contains the first rib, scalenus medius and the first slip of serratus anterior. Its size varies with the extent of the clavicular attachments of sternocleidomastoid and trapezius, and also the level of the inferior belly of omohyoid. The triangle is covered by skin, superficial and deep fasciae, and platysma, and crossed by the supraclavicular nerves. Just above the clavicle, the third part of the subclavian artery curves inferolaterally from the lateral margin of scalenus anterior across the first rib to the axilla. The subclavian vein is behind the clavicle and is not usually in the triangle, but it may rise as high as the artery and even accompany it behind scalenus anterior. The brachial plexus is partly superior, and partly posterior, to the artery and is always closely related to it. The trunks of the brachial plexus may be palpated easily here if the neck is contralaterally flexed and the examining finger is drawn across the trunks at right-angles to their length. With the musculature relaxed, pulsation of the subclavian artery may be felt and the arterial flow can be controlled by retroclavicular compression against the first rib. The suprascapular vessels pass transversely behind the clavicle, below the transverse cervical artery and vein. The external jugular vein descends behind the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid to end in the subclavian vein. It receives the transverse cervical and suprascapular veins, which form a plexus in front of the third part of the subclavian artery. It is joined occasionally by a small vein that crosses the clavicle anteriorly from the cephalic vein. Other structures within the triangle include the nerve to subclavius, which crosses the triangle, and lymph nodes.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0130"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0125">Cervical Fascia</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0160">The organization of the layers of the cervical fascia, and of the tissue ‘spaces’ they enclose, may determine the spread of disease in the head and neck, and facilitates both the differential diagnosis and the surgical management of that disease, particularly in the suprahyoid neck.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="577" id="pagebreak_577"/><a id="pg577"/></div><section><a id="s0135"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0130">Superficial cervical fascia</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0165">Like superficial fascia elsewhere in the body, the superficial cervical fascia is not a separate stratum but a zone of loose connective tissue between dermis and deep fascia and is joined to both.

The portions between trapezius and sternocleidomastoid, and in the anterior triangle of the neck, are formed of areolar tissue, indistinguishable from that in the superficial cervical fascia and deep potential tissue spaces. Superiorly, the deep fascia fuses with periosteum along the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone, over the mastoid process and along the entire base of the mandible. Between the angle of the mandible and the anterior edge of sternocleidomastoid, it is particularly strong. Between the mandible and the mastoid process, it is related to the parotid gland, extending beneath it to become attached to the zygomatic arch. From this region, the strong stylomandibular ligament ascends to the styloid process. Inferiorly, along trapezius and sternocleidomastoid, the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia is attached to the acromion, clavicle and manubrium sterni, fusing with their periostea. A short distance above the manubrium, the investing layer interweaves with aponeurotic fibres of platysma and the fascia investing the strap muscles. It is organized into superficial and deep layers, which are attached to the anterior border of the manubrium, and to the posterior border and the interclavicular ligament, respectively. Between these two layers, a slit-like interval, the suprasternal space, contains a small amount of areolar tissue, the lower parts of the anterior jugular veins and the jugular venous arch, the sternal heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscles and sometimes a lymph node.</div></section><section><a id="s0150"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0145">Middle layer of deep cervical fascia</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0180">Many of the variations in the descriptions of cervical fascia concern the middle layer.

It is usually subdivided into a muscular layer that surrounds the infrahyoid strap muscles and a visceral layer that includes both the pretracheal and buccopharyngeal fasciae. The visceral layer extends inferiorly from the base of the skull posteriorly and the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage anteriorly. Laterally, it provides fascial sheaths of varying thickness for the thyroid gland, larynx, trachea, pharynx and oesophagus, and merges with the investing layer of deep cervical fascia and with the carotid sheath (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 35.4</a>). Inferiorly, it continues into the superior mediastinum along the great vessels and fuses with the fibrous pericardium.</div></section><section><a id="s0155"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0150">Deep layer of deep cervical fascia</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0185">The deep layer of cervical fascia consists of dorsal and ventral layers: the prevertebral and alar fasciae, respectively. In some descriptions, the prevertebral layer is synonymous with the deep layer.</div><div class="text" id="p0190">The prevertebral fascia lies closest to the vertebral bodies, covering the anterior surface of longus capitis and longus colli. It extends inferiorly from the skull base, descending in front of longus colli into the superior mediastinum, where it blends with the anterior longitudinal ligament. It passes laterally and posteriorly as the scalene fascia, which covers the scalene muscles, splenius capitis and levator scapulae. All the ventral rami of the cervical nerves are initially behind the prevertebral fascia. The nerves to the rhomboids and serratus anterior and the proximal portions of the phrenic nerve retain this position throughout their course in the neck, but the accessory nerve lies superficial to the prevertebral fascia. As the subclavian artery and the brachial plexus emerge from behind scalenus anterior, they carry the prevertebral fascia downwards and laterally behind the clavicle as the axillary sheath. The prevertebral fascia is attached to the spinous processes of the vertebrae and forms a fascial floor for the posterior triangle of the neck.</div><div class="text" id="p0195">The alar fascia is a coronally orientated sheet, attached to the transverse process of the cervical vertebrae. It lies anterior to the prevertebral fascia, from which it is separated by loose connective tissue that fills the so-called danger space (see below), and posterior to the pharynx/oesophagus and the visceral layer of the middle deep cervical fascia, from which it is separated by loose connective tissue that fills the retropharyngeal space (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 35.4</a>). It passes anterolaterally to fuse with the prevertebral fascia and extends inferiorly from the skull base to about the level of the seventh cervical vertebra (it varies between C6 and T4), where it fuses with the visceral layer of middle cervical fascia, thereby delimiting the lowest extent of the retropharyngeal and danger spaces.</div></section><section><a id="s0160"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0155">Carotid sheath</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0200">The carotid sheath is a condensation of deep cervical fascia around the common and internal carotid arteries, internal jugular vein, vagus nerve and ansa cervicalis.

Sternocleidomastoid is a key landmark because it divides the neck into anterior and posterior triangles; the anterior triangle may be further subdivided into several smaller named triangles (see above). Muscles in the anterior region are organized into supra- and infrahyoid groups. When removing the body of the hyoid in Sistrunk’s operation or in revision surgery, these supra- and infrahyoid muscles are detached. They are also detached to mobilize the cervical and intrathoracic trachea by ‘dropping the larynx’ during upper airway surgery to resect sections of trachea and repair by primary anastomosis. The suprahyoid muscles connect the hyoid bone to the mandible and the base of the skull and include mylohyoid, geniohyoid, stylohyoid and digastric. The infrahyoid (strap) muscles connect the hyoid, sternum, clavicle and scapula and are arranged in a superficial plane (sternohyoid and omohyoid) and a deep plane (sternothyroid and thyrohyoid).</div><div class="text" id="p0270">The muscles that form part of the musculoskeletal column in the neck are described in <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml">Chapter 46</a>.

The lateral or clavicular head, which is variable in width and contains muscular and fibrous elements, ascends almost vertically from the superior surface of the medial third of the clavicle. The two heads are separated near their attachments by a triangular interval that corresponds to a surface depression, the lesser supraclavicular fossa.

On the left, the common carotid artery comes directly from the arch of the aorta in the superior mediastinum. The right common carotid, therefore, has only a cervical part whereas the left common carotid has cervical and thoracic parts. Following a similar course on both sides, the common carotid artery ascends, diverging laterally from behind the sternoclavicular joint to the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage of the larynx (C3–4 junction), where it divides into external and internal carotid arteries. This bifurcation can sometimes be at a higher or lower level (<a href="#f0040"><span class="bold">Fig. 35.7B</span></a>). The angle of bifurcation remains unchanged from infancy to adulthood.

Below omohyoid, it is sited deeply, and covered by skin, superficial fascia, platysma, deep cervical fascia, and sternocleidomastoid, sternohyoid and sternothyroid. Above omohyoid, it is more superficial, and covered merely by skin, superficial fascia, platysma, deep cervical fascia and the medial margin of sternocleidomastoid; it is crossed obliquely from its medial to lateral side by the sternocleidomastoid branch of the superior thyroid artery. The superior root of the ansa cervicalis, joined by its inferior root from the second and third cervical spinal nerves, lies anterior to, or embedded within, the carotid sheath as it crosses it obliquely. The superior thyroid vein usually crosses near the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and the middle thyroid vein crosses a little below the level of the cricoid cartilage. The anterior jugular vein crosses the common carotid artery above the clavicle, separated from it by sternohyoid and sternothyroid. Posterior to the carotid sheath are the transverse processes of the fourth to sixth cervical vertebrae, to which are attached longus colli, longus capitis and tendinous slips of scalenus anterior. The sympathetic trunk and ascending cervical branch of the inferior thyroid artery lie between the common carotid artery and the muscles. Below the level of the sixth cervical vertebra, the artery is in an angle between scalenus anterior and longus colli, anterior to the vertebral vessels, inferior thyroid and subclavian arteries, sympathetic trunk and, on the left, the thoracic duct. The oesophagus, trachea, inferior thyroid artery, recurrent laryngeal nerve and, at a higher level, the larynx and pharynx are medial to the sheath and its contents.

Except near the skull, the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve are lateral to it within the carotid sheath. The external carotid artery is first anteromedial, but then curves back to lie superficial. Posteriorly, the internal carotid adjoins longus capitis, and the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion lies between them. The superior laryngeal nerve crosses obliquely behind it. The pharyngeal wall lies medial to the artery, which is separated by fat and pharyngeal veins from the ascending pharyngeal artery and superior laryngeal nerve. Anterolaterally, the internal carotid artery is covered by sternocleidomastoid. Below the posterior belly of digastric, the hypoglossal nerve and superior root of the ansa cervicalis and the lingual and facial veins are superficial to the artery. At the level of the digastric, the internal carotid is crossed by stylohyoid and the occipital and posterior auricular arteries. Above digastric, it is separated from the external carotid artery by the styloid process, styloglossus and stylopharyngeus, the glossopharyngeal nerve and the pharyngeal branch of the vagus, and the deeper part of the parotid gland. At the base of the skull, the glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory and hypoglossal nerves lie between the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein, which here has become posterior. The length of the artery varies with the length of the neck and the point of the carotid bifurcation. It may arise from the aortic arch, in which case it lies medial to the external carotid as far as the larynx, where it crosses behind it.

Glomus cells store a number of peptides, particularly enkephalins, bombesin and neurotensin, and amines including dopamine, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine), and are therefore regarded as paraneurones.

Preganglionic sympathetic axons and fibres from the carotid sinus synapse on parasympathetic and sympathetic ganglion cells, which lie either in isolation or in small groups near the surface of each carotid body.

Relations between the terminal branches of the artery and recurrent laryngeal nerve are very variable and of considerable surgical importance. The artery usually passes behind the nerve as it nears the gland. However, very close to the gland, the right nerve is equally likely to be anterior, posterior or amongst the branches of the artery, and the left nerve is usually posterior. Together with the inferior thyroid and common carotid arteries, the recurrent laryngeal nerve forms one of the sides of Beahr’s triangle (see later). Since the nerve winds around the artery of the sixth branchial arch (aortic arch) on the left side, it is 45<sup>°</sup> to the midline in its ascent from the chest to the neck. However, on the right side it is slightly more superficial and lateral because it goes around the fourth branchial arch artery (subclavian) in the neck: these variations are important in thyroid surgery and are reversed in dextrocardia. The artery is not accompanied by the inferior thyroid vein.</div><section><a id="s1115"/><section><a id="s1785"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0800">Muscular branches</p><div class="textfl" id="p0960">These supply the infrahyoid muscles, longus colli, scalenus anterior and the inferior pharyngeal constrictor.</div></section><section><a id="s1127"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0805">Ascending cervical artery</p><div class="textfl" id="p0965">The ascending cervical artery is a small branch that arises as the inferior thyroid artery turns medially behind the carotid sheath and ascends on the anterior tubercles of the cervical transverse processes between scalenus anterior and longus capitis.

Gentle aspiration of the syringe is performed while the needle is being advanced until the subclavian vein is punctured. In children under the age of 3 years, the supraclavicular approach to the subclavian vein is associated with a shorter puncture time and a reduced incidence of guidewire misplacement compared with the infraclavicular approach (<a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355_split_a.xhtml#bib6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_6">Byon et al 2013</a>).</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s1325"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0965">Lymphatic drainage</h3><div class="textfl" id="p1135">Lymph nodes in the head and neck are distributed in terminal and outlying groups (<a href="#f0080"><span class="bold">Fig. 35.15</span></a>; see <a href="../B9780702077050000331/B9780702077050000331.xhtml#f0040">Fig. 33.5</a>).

It is vitally important to understand these patterns of spread so that the appropriate operation is undertaken for each patient. Clinical experience has shown that the lymph nodes in the neck fall into five distinct groups (see <a href="../B9780702077050000331/B9780702077050000331.xhtml#f0040">Fig. 33.5</a>, <a href="#f0080">Fig. 35.15</a>). Level I nodes lie in the submandibular triangle bounded by the anterior and posterior bellies of digastric and the lower border of the mandible above. Level I is further divided into level IA (submental triangle) and level IB (submandibular triangle). Level II (upper jugular) nodes lie around the upper portion of the internal jugular vein and the upper part of the accessory nerve. They extend from the skull base to the bifurcation of the common carotid artery or the hyoid bone. Level III (middle jugular) nodes lie around the middle third of the internal jugular vein from the inferior border of level II to the superior belly of omohyoid or the cricothyroid membrane. Level IV (lower jugular) nodes lie around the lower third of the internal jugular vein from the inferior border of level III to the clavicle. The anterior and posterior borders for levels II, III and IV are the lateral border of sternohyoid and the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid, respectively. In other words, deep to sternocleidomastoid in between the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck. Level V (posterior triangle) nodes lie mostly around the lower part of the accessory nerve and the transverse cervical vessels. The accessory nerve divides level V into Va above and Vb below.</div><div class="text" id="p1180">Knowing which levels of nodes are likely to be involved in metastatic spread of a cancer arising in the head and neck helps select the appropriate nodal clearance at surgery.

Modified radical neck dissections (functional neck dissections) remove level I–V nodes but spare either or all of sternocleidomastoid, the internal jugular vein and the accessory nerve. Selective neck dissections remove selected groups of nodes, e.g. the supra-omohyoid neck dissection removes level I–III nodes, the lateral neck dissection removes level II–IV nodes, and the posterolateral neck dissection removes level II–V nodes.</div></section><section><a id="s1385"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle1010">Cervical lymphovenous portals</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1185">Lymph is returned to the systemic venous circulation via right and left lymphovenous portals that are sited at, or near, the junctions of the internal jugular and subclavian veins (<a href="#f0085"><span class="bold">Fig. 35.16</span></a>).

Transient or sustained hypertension may follow surgical section of the nerve and indicates involvement of the carotid branch. Isolated lesions of the glossopharyngeal nerve lead to loss of sensation over the ipsilateral soft palate, fauces, pharynx and posterior third of the tongue, although this is difficult to assess clinically, and confirmation requires galvanic stimulation. The palatal and pharyngeal (gag) reflexes are reduced or absent and salivary secretion from the parotid gland may also be reduced. Weakness of stylopharyngeus cannot be tested individually. Glossopharyngeal neuralgia consists of episodic brief but severe pain, often precipitated by swallowing and experienced in the throat, behind the angle of the jaw and within the ear. Superior jugular bulb thromboses (e.g. in otitis media) and jugular foramen syndrome (associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma or a jugular paraganglioma) may cause lesions of the adjacent glossopharyngeal, vagus and accessory nerves, with associated weakness in the muscles supplied in the pharynx and larynx.</div></section></section><section><a id="s1535"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle1130">Vagus nerve</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1355">The vagus is a large mixed nerve.

Both nerves lie anterior to a fibrous septum that separates them from the glossopharyngeal nerve. The vagus descends vertically in the neck in the carotid sheath, between the internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery, to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and then passes between the vein and the common carotid artery to the root of the neck. Its relationships in this part of its course are therefore similar to those described for these structures (see <a href="#f0040">Figs 35.7A</a>, <a href="#f0045">35.8</a>, <a href="#f0090">35.17</a>). Its further course differs on the two sides. The right vagus descends posterior to the internal jugular vein to cross the first part of the subclavian artery and enter the thorax. The left vagus enters the thorax between the left common carotid and subclavian arteries, and behind the left brachiocephalic vein.</div><div class="text" id="p1365">After emerging from the jugular foramen, the vagus bears two marked enlargements: a small, round, superior (jugular) ganglion and a larger inferior (nodose) ganglion.</div><section><a id="s1540"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle1135">Superior (jugular) ganglion</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1370">The superior ganglion is greyish, spherical and approximately 4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm in diameter.

The superior ganglion is chiefly somatic and most of its neurones enter the auricular nerve, whilst neurones in the inferior ganglion are concerned with visceral sensation from the heart, larynx, lungs and the alimentary tract from the pharynx to the transverse colon. Some fibres transmit impulses from taste endings in the vallecula and epiglottis. Large afferent fibres are derived from muscle spindles in the laryngeal muscles. Vagal sensory neurones in the nodose ganglion may show some somatotopic organization. Both ganglia are traversed by parasympathetic and perhaps some sympathetic fibres, but there is no evidence that vagal parasympathetic components relay in the inferior ganglion. Preganglionic motor fibres from the dorsal vagal nucleus and the special visceral efferents from the nucleus ambiguus, which descend to the inferior vagal ganglion, commonly form a visible band, skirting the ganglion in some mammals. These larger fibres probably provide motor innervation to the larynx in the recurrent laryngeal nerve, together with some contribution to the superior laryngeal nerve supplying cricothyroid.</div></section><section><a id="s122"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle1145">Branches in the neck</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1385">The branches of the vagus in the neck are the meningeal, auricular, pharyngeal, carotid body, superior and recurrent laryngeal nerves and cardiac branches.</div><section><a id="s1565"/><section><a id="s1534"/><section><a id="s1569"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle1150">Meningeal branches</p><div class="textfl" id="p1390">Meningeal branches appear to start from the superior vagal ganglion and pass through the jugular foramen to be distributed to the dura mater in the posterior cranial fossa (see <a href="../B9780702077050000252/B9780702077050000252.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 25.2B</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s1570"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle1155">Auricular branch</p><div class="textfl" id="p1395">The auricular branch (Arnold's nerve) arises from the superior vagal ganglion and is joined by a branch from the inferior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve.

It also carries afferent fibres from the laryngeal neuromuscular spindles and other stretch receptors. It descends to the thyrohyoid membrane, pierces it above the superior laryngeal artery and divides into an upper and lower branch. The upper branch is horizontal and supplies the mucosa of the pharynx, the epiglottis, vallecula and laryngeal vestibule. The lower branch descends in the medial wall of the piriform recess, supplies the aryepiglottic fold, the mucosa on the back of the arytenoid cartilage and one or two branches to transverse arytenoid (the latter unite with twigs from the recurrent laryngeal to supply the same muscle). The internal laryngeal nerve ends by piercing the inferior pharyngeal constrictor to unite with an ascending branch from the recurrent laryngeal nerve. As it ascends in the neck, it supplies branches, more numerous on the left, to the mucosa and tunica muscularis of the oesophagus and trachea, and to the inferior constrictor.</div><div class="text" id="p1420">The external laryngeal nerve, smaller than the internal, descends behind sternohyoid with the superior thyroid artery, but on a deeper plane. It lies first on the inferior pharyngeal constrictor, and then pierces it to curve round the inferior thyroid tubercle and reach cricothyroid, which it supplies: this branch can be damaged when ligating the superior thyroid artery in thyroid surgery. The nerve also gives branches to the pharyngeal plexus and the inferior constrictor. Behind the common carotid artery, the external laryngeal nerve communicates with the superior cardiac nerve and superior cervical sympathetic ganglion.</div></section><section><a id="s1600"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle1175">Recurrent laryngeal nerve</p><div class="textfl" id="p1425">The recurrent laryngeal nerve differs, in origin and course, on the two sides. On the right, it arises from the vagus anterior to the first part of the subclavian artery, and curves backwards below and then behind it to ascend obliquely to the side of the trachea behind the common carotid artery. Near the lower pole of the lateral lobe of the thyroid gland, it is closely related to the inferior thyroid artery and crosses either in front of, behind or between its branches. On the left, the nerve arises from the vagus on the left of the aortic arch, curves below it immediately behind the attachment of the ligamentum arteriosum to the concavity of the aortic arch and ascends to the side of the trachea (see <a href="#f0075">Fig. 35.14</a>). As the recurrent laryngeal nerve curves round the subclavian artery, or the aortic arch, it gives cardiac filaments to the deep cardiac plexus. On both sides, the recurrent laryngeal nerve ascends in or near a groove between the trachea and oesophagus. It is closely related to the medial surface of the thyroid gland before it passes under the lower border of the inferior constrictor, and it enters the larynx behind the articulation of the inferior thyroid cornu with the cricoid cartilage. The recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies all laryngeal muscles, except the cricothyroid, and it communicates with the internal laryngeal nerve, supplying sensory filaments to the laryngeal mucosa below the vocal folds. It also carries afferent fibres from laryngeal stretch receptors. The recurrent laryngeal nerve is described further in <a href="../B9780702077050000410/B9780702077050000410.xhtml#c0041">Chapter 41</a> (see <a href="../B9780702077050000410/B9780702077050000410.xhtml#f0060">Figs 41.11</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000410/B9780702077050000410.xhtml#f0065">41.12</a>).

Some rootlets emerge directly, while others turn cranially before exiting; their line of exit is irregular rather than linear. They join to form a trunk, the accessory nerve, which ascends intradurally within the vertebral canal between the ligamentum denticulatum and the dorsal roots of the spinal nerves. The nerve enters the skull via the foramen magnum, behind the vertebral artery. It then turns upwards and passes laterally to reach the jugular foramen, which it traverses in a common dural sheath with the vagus, but separated from that nerve by a fold of arachnoid mater.</div><div class="text" id="p1435">As the accessory nerve exits the jugular foramen, it runs posterolaterally and passes either medial or lateral to the internal jugular vein; occasionally, it may pass through the vein. The extradural part of the nerve then crosses the transverse process of the atlas and is crossed by the occipital artery before descending obliquely, medial to the styloid process, stylohyoid and the posterior belly of digastric. Running with the superior sternocleidomastoid branch of the occipital artery, it reaches the upper part of sternocleidomastoid and enters its deep surface, to form an anastomosis with fibres from C2 alone, C3 alone, or C2 and C3 (the ansa of Maubrac). It may also communicate with the anterior root of the first cervical nerve (McKenzie branch).</div><div class="text" id="p1440">The accessory nerve occasionally terminates in sternocleidomastoid. More commonly, it emerges a little above the midpoint of the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid, generally above the emergence of the great auricular nerve (usually within 2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm of it) and between 4 and 6<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm from the tip of the mastoid process. However, the point of emergence is very variable. The nerve then crosses the posterior triangle on levator scapulae (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 35.7A</a>), separated from it by the prevertebral layer of deep cervical fascia and adipose tissue. Here the nerve is relatively superficial within the roof of the posterior triangle and is related to superficial cervical lymph nodes in levels Va and Vb.

The supranuclear pathway of fibres destined for sternocleidomastoid is not simple; current evidence favours bilateral hemispheric innervation, although opinion varies as to the extent of the ipsilateral input. The motor supply to the descending (upper) and transverse (middle) portions of trapezius is primarily from the accessory nerve under predominantly contralateral supranuclear control. Usually, trapezius receives an innervation from the cervical plexus, in most cases from C3 and C4 (<a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355_split_a.xhtml#bib46" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_46">Tubbs et al 2011</a>). A study using intraoperative electroneurography and histochemical analyses found that, when present, the cervical fibres did not consistently innervate all three parts of the muscle (descending, transverse and ascending), and that fibres from C2 usually travelled via the accessory nerve, while fibres from C3 and C4 innervated trapezius independently (<a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355_split_a.xhtml#bib32" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_32">Pu et al 2008</a>).

The supranuclear fibres that influence motor neurones innervating sternocleidomastoid decussate twice; a lesion of the corticospinal system above the pons therefore produces weakness of the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid and contralateral trapezius. Episodic contraction of sternocleidomastoid and trapezius, often accompanied by contraction of other muscle groups, e.g. splenius capitis, occurs in spasmodic torticollis, a focal dystonia. In jugular foramen syndrome, caused by pathologies including nasopharyngeal carcinoma or a jugular paraganglioma, lesions of the glossopharyngeal, vagus and accessory nerves coexist. The accessory nerve can be injured more distally in the neck by trauma or by surgical exploration in the posterior triangle.

The hypoglossal rootlets run laterally behind the vertebral artery, collected into two bundles that perforate the dura mater separately opposite the hypoglossal canal in the occipital bone, and unite after traversing it. The canal is sometimes divided by a spicule of bone. The nerve emerges from the canal in a plane medial to the internal jugular vein, internal carotid artery and ninth, tenth and eleventh cranial nerves, and passes inferolaterally behind the internal carotid artery and glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves to the interval between the artery and the internal jugular vein (see <a href="#f0045">Fig. 35.8</a>). Here, it makes a half-spiral turn round the inferior vagal ganglion and is united with it by connective tissue. It then descends almost vertically between the vessels and anterior to the vagus to a point level with the angle of the mandible, becoming superficial below the posterior belly of digastric and emerging between the internal jugular vein and internal carotid artery. Often associated with a plexus of veins around the junction of the common facial and internal jugular veins (vena comitans nervi hypoglossi), excessive bleeding here during neck dissection can lead to nerve damage. The nerve loops round the inferior sternocleidomastoid branch of the occipital artery, crosses lateral to both internal and external carotid arteries and the loop of the lingual artery a little above the tip of the greater cornu of the hyoid, and is itself crossed by the facial vein (see <a href="#f0040">Figs 35.7A</a>, <a href="#f0045">35.8</a>, <a href="#f0090">35.17</a>).

There may occasionally, however, be two or four ganglia. The cervical sympathetic ganglia send grey rami communicantes to all the cervical spinal nerves but receive no white rami communicantes from them.

The internal carotid artery within the carotid sheath is anterior, and longus capitis is posterior. The lower end of the ganglion is united by a connecting trunk to the middle cervical ganglion. Postganglionic branches are distributed in the internal carotid nerve, which ascends with the internal carotid artery into the carotid canal to enter the cranial cavity, and in lateral, medial and anterior branches.

The laryngopharyngeal branches supply the carotid body and pass to the side of the pharynx, joining glossopharyngeal and vagal rami to form the pharyngeal plexus. A cardiac branch arises by two or more filaments from the lower part of the superior cervical ganglion and occasionally receives a twig from the trunk between the superior and middle cervical ganglia. It is thought to contain only efferent fibres, the preganglionic outflow being from the upper thoracic segments of the spinal cord, and to be devoid of pain fibres from the heart. It descends behind the common carotid artery, in front of longus colli, and crosses anterior to the inferior thyroid artery and recurrent laryngeal nerve. The courses on the two sides then differ. The right cardiac branch usually passes behind, but sometimes in front of, the subclavian artery and runs posterolateral to the brachiocephalic trunk to join the deep (dorsal) part of the cardiac plexus behind the aortic arch. It has other sympathetic connections. About mid-neck, it receives filaments from the external laryngeal nerve. Inferiorly, one or two vagal cardiac branches join it. As it enters the thorax, it is joined by a filament from the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Filaments from the nerve also communicate with the thyroid branches of the middle cervical ganglion. The left cardiac branch, in the thorax, is anterior to the left common carotid artery and crosses in front of the left side of the aortic arch to reach the superficial (ventral) part of the cardiac plexus. Sometimes, it descends on the right of the aorta to end in the deep (dorsal) part of the cardiac plexus.

It is usually found at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra, anterior or just superior to the inferior thyroid artery, or it may adjoin the inferior cervical ganglion. It probably represents a coalescence of the ganglia of the fifth and sixth cervical segments, judging by its postganglionic rami, which join the fifth and sixth cervical spinal nerves (but sometimes also the fourth and seventh). It is connected to the inferior cervical ganglion by two or more very variable cords. The posterior cord usually splits to enclose the vertebral artery, while the anterior cord loops down anterior to, and then below, the first part of the subclavian artery, medial to the origin of its internal thoracic branch, and supplies rami to it. This loop is the ansa subclavia and is frequently multiple, lies in close contact with the cervical pleura, and typically connects with the phrenic nerve, and sometimes with the vagus nerve (see <a href="#f0095">Fig. 35.18</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1540">The middle cervical ganglion gives off thyroid and cardiac branches. The thyroid branches accompany the inferior thyroid artery to the thyroid gland. They communicate with the superior cardiac, external laryngeal and recurrent laryngeal nerves, and send branches to the parathyroid glands. Fibres to both glands are largely vasomotor but some reach the secretory cells. The cardiac branch, the largest sympathetic cardiac nerve, arises either from the ganglion itself or more often from the sympathetic trunk cranial or caudal to it. On the right side, it descends behind the common carotid artery and anterior or posterior to the subclavian artery, to the trachea, where it receives a few filaments from the recurrent laryngeal nerve before joining the right half of the deep (dorsal) part of the cardiac plexus. In the neck, it connects with the superior cardiac and recurrent laryngeal nerves. On the left side, the cardiac nerve enters the thorax between the left common carotid and subclavian arteries to join the left half of the deep (dorsal) part of the cardiac plexus.

It is probably formed by a fusion of the lower two cervical and first thoracic segmental ganglia, sometimes including the second and even third and fourth thoracic ganglia. The first thoracic ganglion may be separate, leaving an inferior cervical ganglion above it. The sympathetic trunk turns backwards at the junction of the neck and thorax, and so the long axis of the cervicothoracic ganglion becomes almost anteroposterior. The ganglion lies on or just lateral to the lateral border of longus colli between the base of the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib (which are both posterior to it). The vertebral vessels are anterior, and the ganglion is separated from the posterior aspect of the cervical pleura inferiorly by the suprapleural membrane. The costocervical trunk of the subclavian artery branches near the lower pole of the ganglion, and the supreme intercostal artery is lateral.</div><div class="text" id="p1550">A small vertebral ganglion may be present on the sympathetic trunk anterior or anteromedial to the origin of the vertebral artery and directly superior to the subclavian artery. When present, it may provide the ansa subclavia. It is also joined to the inferior cervical ganglion by fibres enclosing the vertebral artery and is usually regarded as a detached part of the middle cervical or inferior cervical ganglion. Like the middle cervical ganglion, it may supply grey rami communicantes to the fourth and fifth cervical spinal nerves. The inferior cervical ganglion sends grey rami communicantes to the seventh and eighth cervical and first thoracic spinal nerves, and gives off a cardiac branch, branches to nearby vessels and sometimes a branch to the vagus nerve.</div><div class="text" id="p1555">The grey rami communicantes to the seventh cervical spinal nerve vary from one to five (two being the usual number). A third often ascends medial to the vertebral artery in front of the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. It connects with the seventh cervical nerve, and sends a filament upwards through the transverse foramen of the sixth cervical vertebra in company with the vertebral vessels to join the sixth cervical spinal nerve as it emerges from the intervertebral foramen. An inconstant ramus may traverse the transverse foramen of the seventh cervical vertebra. Grey rami to the eighth cervical spinal nerve vary from three to six in number.</div><div class="text" id="p1560">The cardiac branch descends behind the subclavian artery and along the anterior aspect of the trachea to the deep cardiac plexus.

The subclavian supply is derived from the inferior cervical ganglion and ansa subclavia, and typically extends to the first part of the axillary artery, although a few fibres may extend further. An extension of the subclavian plexus to the internal thoracic artery may be joined by a branch of the phrenic nerve.</div><div class="text" id="p1570">Within the foramina transversaria and intertransverse spaces, the cervical grey rami communicantes form intersegmental arcades as they communicate with one another and the ventral rami of the upper five or six cervical spinal nerves. These arcades accompany the second part of the vertebral artery and create the appearance of a long nerve known as the vertebral nerve. Fine filaments from this nerve and the grey rami communicantes form the vertebral plexus on the surface of the vertebral artery. This plexus contains not only sympathetic efferent fibres but also somatic sensory fibres from the adventitia of the artery with cell bodies in the cervical dorsal root ganglia. The vertebral nerve sends filaments to the posterolateral corners of the cervical intervertebral discs (<a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355_split_a.xhtml#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_1">Bogduk et al 1988</a>), and gives rise to the meningeal branches (sinuvertebral nerves) at each cervical segment. The vertebral plexus, which contains some neuronal cell bodies, continues into the skull along the vertebral and basilar arteries and their branches as far as the posterior cerebral artery, where it meets a plexus from the internal carotid artery. The plexus on the inferior thyroid artery reaches the thyroid gland and connects with the recurrent and external laryngeal nerves, the cardiac branch of the superior cervical ganglion, and the common carotid plexus.</div><section><a id="s1710"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle1260">Horner's syndrome</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1575">Any condition or injury that destroys the sympathetic trunk ascending from the thorax through the neck into the face results in Horner's syndrome (Bernard–Horner syndrome, oculosympathetic palsy), characterized by a drooping eyelid (ptosis), sunken globe (enophthalmos), narrow palpebral fissure, contracted pupil (meiosis), and vasodilation and lack of thermal sweating (anhydrosis) of the face on the affected side. Classically, this is seen in patients with bronchial carcinomas that have invaded the sympathetic trunk and it is a recognized complication of cervical sympathectomy or a radical neck dissection.

The superior thyroid vein emerges from the upper part of the gland, runs with the superior thyroid artery towards the carotid sheath and drains into the internal jugular vein. The middle thyroid vein collects blood from the lower part of the gland; it emerges from the lateral surface of the gland and drains into the internal jugular vein. The inferior thyroid veins arise in a glandular venous plexus that connects with the middle and superior thyroid veins. These veins form a pretracheal plexus, from which the left inferior vein descends to join the left brachiocephalic vein, and the right descends obliquely across the brachiocephalic artery to join the right brachiocephalic vein at its junction with the superior vena cava. The inferior thyroid veins often open via a common trunk into the superior vena cava or left brachiocephalic vein. They drain the oesophageal, tracheal and inferior laryngeal veins and have valves at their terminations.</div></section><section><a id="s1750"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle1300">Lymphatics</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1630">Thyroid lymphatic vessels communicate within the gland and the tracheal plexus, passing onwards to prelaryngeal nodes just above the thyroid isthmus and then to pretracheal and paratracheal nodes (level VI). Some may also drain into the brachiocephalic nodes related to the thymus in the superior mediastinum (level VII). Laterally, the gland is drained to the deep cervical nodes (level IV) by vessels lying along the superior thyroid veins. Thyroid lymphatics may drain directly, with no intervening node, to the thoracic duct. In summary, the major lymphatic drainage of the thyroid is to the middle and lower jugular lymph nodes in levels III and IV and to the posterior triangle nodes in level Vb, supplemented by minor drainage to the pretracheal and paratracheal nodes in level VI and to the superior mediastinal nodes in level VII.</div></section></section><section><a id="s1755"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle1305">Innervation</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1635">The thyroid gland receives its innervation from the superior, middle and inferior cervical sympathetic ganglia.

The thyroid gland is highly vascular and demonstrates intense contrast enhancement and increased signal on T2-weighted MRI (<a href="#f0179"><span class="bold">Fig. 35.22</span></a>). Radionuclide imaging of the thyroid may be performed with technetium (<sup>99m</sup>Tc) pertechnetate.

Sufficient iodothyroglobulin is stored extracellularly within follicles to regulate the metabolic activity of the body for up to 3 months.

The iodinated thyroglobulin in the intracellular colloid droplets is then degraded by follicular cell lysosomes, liberating T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub>, which pass to the base of the cell, where they are released: they are exported from the thyroid mainly via the blood capillaries and lymphatics.

The external laryngeal nerve runs close to the superior thyroid artery in Joll’s triangle, and the recurrent laryngeal nerve runs close to the inferior thyroid artery in Beahr’s triangle. Total thyroidectomy may be necessary in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, benign thyroid enlargement in the euthyroid state, and for cancer (which is often combined with a selective neck dissection of the primary major lymph node echelon levels, i.e. III, IV and VI).

The brachiocephalic veins are formed by the union of the internal jugular and subclavian veins at the junction of the neck and thorax, behind the head of the clavicle.</div><div class="text" id="p1745">The essential anatomical landmark in orientating and understanding the root of the neck is scalenus anterior, covered by the prevertebral layer of deep cervical fascia. It is important to understand its immediate relations. Anteriorly lie sternocleidomastoid and subclavius, the intermediate tendon of omohyoid, the subclavian vein, branches from the thyrocervical trunk of the first part of the subclavian artery (transverse cervical, suprascapular and ascending cervical arteries), and the phrenic nerve. The nerve lies on the surface of scalenus anterior in the root of the neck, before passing between it and the subclavian vein to enter the superior mediastinum and it is the anatomical key to identifying the muscle intraoperatively. Posteriorly, the roots of the brachial plexus and the second part of the subclavian artery separate scalenus anterior from scalenus medius. Pathologies that cause impingement on either the brachial plexus or the subclavian artery may present clinically as an upper limb compression syndrome. The suprapleural membrane and pleura are intimate posterior relations of scalenus anterior. On each side, the apical (cervical) pleura and the apex of the lung bulge up into the root of the neck. The height to which the apical pleura rises, with reference to the first pair of ribs and costal cartilages, varies in different individuals according to the obliquity of their thoracic inlet. Posteriorly, the apical pleura typically reaches the level of the neck of the first rib, forming a domed roof over each side of the thoracic cavity that is strengthened by the suprapleural membrane. Scalenus anterior covers the anterolateral part of the dome of the pleura, separating it from the subclavian vein. The subclavian artery crosses the dome below its summit, immediately above the vein. The costocervical trunk arches backwards from the subclavian artery and crosses the summit of the dome; its supreme intercostal branch descends behind the dome, between the first intercostal nerve laterally and the first thoracic sympathetic ganglion medially.</div><div class="text" id="p1750">Medial relations of scalenus anterior are longus colli and the inferior thyroid artery. The two muscles are separated by an angular interval through which the vertebral artery and vein pass to gain access to the foramen transversarium of the sixth cervical vertebra, and more anteriorly the inferior thyroid artery arches from lateral to medial on its way to the thyroid gland. The area also contains some level IV and scalene nodes within Chassaignac’s triangle (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 35.5B</a>). The cervical sympathetic trunk and the inferior cervical ganglion lie close to the posteromedial aspect of the vertebral artery here. The internal thoracic artery descends from the first part of the subclavian artery, passes behind the brachiocephalic vein and, on the right side, is crossed by the phrenic nerve. The vagus nerve descends anterior to the first part of the subclavian artery, and on the right side only, gives off its recurrent laryngeal branch which usually turns around the lower border of the artery. The terminal portions of the thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct, on the left and right sides, respectively, cross the triangular interval at the level of the seventh cervical vertebra and come into contact with the medial edge of scalenus anterior.</div><div class="text" id="p1755">The axillary sheath, an extension of the prevertebral fascia that accompanies the axillary artery and trunks of the brachial plexus, lies lateral to scalenus anterior.</div><section><a id="s1835"/><section><a id="s1830"/><section><a id="s1978"/><h3 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle1360">Cervical rib</h3><div class="textfl" id="p1760">A small additional rib (cervical rib) may develop in the root of the neck in association with the seventh cervical vertebra.

It lies approximately in the sagittal plane but its point of bifurcation is usually a little to the right. The trachea is flexible and can rapidly alter in length.

Anteriorly, the cervical part of the trachea is crossed by skin and by the superficial and deep fasciae. It is also crossed by the jugular arch and overlapped by sternohyoid and sternothyroid. The second to fourth tracheal cartilages are crossed by the isthmus of the thyroid gland, above which an anastomotic artery connects the bilateral superior thyroid arteries. Below and in front are the pretracheal fascia, inferior thyroid veins, thymic remnants and the arteria thyroidea ima (when it exists). In children, the brachiocephalic artery crosses obliquely in front of the trachea at or a little above the upper border of the manubrium. The left brachiocephalic vein may also rise a little above this level. The oesophagus lies posterior to the trachea and separates it from the vertebral column. The paired lobes of the thyroid gland, which descend to the fifth or sixth tracheal cartilage, and the common carotid and inferior thyroid arteries all lie lateral to the trachea. The recurrent laryngeal nerves ascend on each side, in or near the grooves between the sides of the trachea and oesophagus.</div></section><section><a id="s1910"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle1395">Vascular supply and lymphatic drainage</p><div class="textfl" id="p1795">The cervical part of the trachea is mainly supplied by branches from the inferior thyroid arteries.
