Superiorly, it communicates with the neck via the superior thoracic aperture. Laterally it merges into the lung interstitium, incorporating the bronchial tree and pulmonary vasculature. The mediastinum is subdivided into superior and inferior regions by a horizontal plane that passes posteriorly from the level of the manubriosternal joint. The inferior mediastinum is further subdivided into anterior, middle and posterior parts. Each mediastinal region contains key viscera and neurovasculature of, or passing through, the thorax. Excluding the heart (<a href="../B9780702077050000574/B9780702077050000574.xhtml">Ch. 57</a>) and great vessels (<a href="../B9780702077050000586/B9780702077050000586.xhtml">Ch. 58</a>), these are considered in detail.

It is bounded laterally by the mediastinal parietal pleurae (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 56.1</a>). The reflections of the left and right costal parietal pleura onto the superior mediastinum each follow a line that passes from the sternoclavicular joint in an inferomedial direction, to meet each other in the midline posterior to the sternal angle (see <a href="../B9780702077050000537/B9780702077050000537.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 53.4B</a>). The resultant triangular space on the posterior surface of the manubrium of the sternum and between the lines of pleural reflection is occupied by the thymus or its remnants. The superior mediastinum contains the trachea, oesophagus, aortic arch, brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid and subclavian arteries (the vertebral artery sometimes arises from the aortic arch between them), the internal thoracic arteries, the supreme intercostal, left superior intercostal, accessory hemiazygos, internal thoracic and inferior thyroid veins, and numerous lymph nodes, including those of the para-aortic, upper paratracheal, retrotracheal and prevascular groups (stations). Laterally, the superior mediastinal structures have the appearance of being ‘shrink-wrapped’ by the tightly applied mediastinal parietal pleura. The superior mediastinum transmits the sympathetic trunks, the sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiac nerves, the phrenic nerves laterally, the vagus nerves medially and the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. The terminal part of the thoracic duct emerges from the posterior aspect of the aortic arch and oesophagus, and passes superiorly between the left subclavian and left common carotid arteries to enter the neck (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 56.7B</a>). The left and right brachiocephalic veins join to form the superior vena cava. The origins of sternothyroid and sternohyoid are attached to the posterior surface of the manubrium of the sternum. An enlarged thyroid gland may extend inferiorly between the manubrium and the brachiocephalic veins; its surgical excision requires care due to possible venous adherence. The origins of longus colli (inferior oblique and vertical intermediate portions) are the deepest contents of the superior mediastinum.</div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0030">Inferior mediastinum</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0035">Anterior mediastinum</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0025"/><div class="textfl" id="p0035">The anterior mediastinum lies between the sternal body and fibrous pericardium (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 56.1</a>).

The paired sternocostal triangles (of Morgagni) are openings between the sternal and costal attachments of the respiratory diaphragm: they are filled with areolar tissue and crossed by the superior epigastric vessels and by some lymph vessels from the abdominal wall and liver. A retrosternal hernia may pass through the triangles. The pericardium and the heart are routinely approached by either a complete or partial median sternotomy. The sternopericardial ligaments and the pleural reflections are easily separated by blunt dissection. In case of pericardial tamponade, the pericardial cavity can be drained through a left parasternal or subxiphoid approach, normally without entering the pleural cavity.</div></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0040">Middle mediastinum</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0040">The middle mediastinum is the broadest part of the inferior mediastinum (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 56.1</a>) and contains the pericardia, heart and ascending aorta, the intrapericardial (inferior) half of the superior vena cava (receiving the azygos vein posteriorly), the tracheal bifurcation and main bronchi, the pulmonary trunk, right and left pulmonary arteries and veins, phrenic nerves, the deep part of the cardiac plexus and the subcarinal and lower paratracheal (tracheobronchial) lymph nodes. The short thoracic part of the inferior vena cava, both the extra- and intrapericardial segments, extends between the caval foramen of the respiratory diaphragm, through which it passes, and its termination in the right atrium. The structures forming the root of the lung converge at the hilum of the lung. The mediastinal part of the parietal pleura forms the lateral boundary of the middle mediastinum and is continuous with the visceral pleura at the level of the root of the lung and pulmonary ligament; the parietal pleura folds back (reflects) on itself to continue as the visceral pleura. The fibrous pericardium lies on, and is fused with, the middle folium of the central tendon of the respiratory diaphragm (see <a href="../B9780702077050000550/B9780702077050000550.xhtml#f0015">Fig. 55.3A</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0045">Posterior mediastinum</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0045">The posterior mediastinum is the longest and narrowest part of the inferior mediastinum (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 56.1</a>). It is bounded anteriorly by the tracheal bifurcation, fibrous pericardium and pulmonary vessels, and posteriorly by the bodies of the fourth or fifth to the twelfth thoracic vertebrae, and the intervening intervertebral discs. Numerous structures pass freely between the superior and posterior mediastina. The curved posterior third of the median (midline) region of the respiratory diaphragm constitutes the anteroinferior limit of the posterior mediastinum. Two pleural recesses, the aortico-oesophageal and azygo-oesophageal, project medially between the aorta and oesophagus on the left side and the azygos vein and oesophagus on the right side (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 56.7</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0050">The posterior mediastinum contains the descending thoracic aorta (on the left side of the vertebral column), the oesophagus (median, but positioned anterior to the aorta inferiorly) and, more posteriorly, the azygos and hemiazygos venous systems, the thoracic duct, prevertebral and para-oesophageal lymph nodes, right and left sympathetic trunks and associated ganglia, and thoracic splanchnic nerves. The vagal trunks are located adjacent to the oesophagus; the anterior trunk is constituted mainly from the left vagus nerve and the posterior mainly from the right vagus nerve. The descending thoracic aorta gives off the intercostal arteries (see <a href="../B9780702077050000525/B9780702077050000525.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 52.3</a>) and the largest anterior segmental medullary artery, the ‘great radicular artery of Adamkiewicz’ (<a href="#bib55" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_55">Yoshioka et al 2003</a>) (see <a href="../B9780702077050000471/B9780702077050000471.xhtml#f0070">Fig. 47.11</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0055">There are communications between the posterior mediastinum and the abdomen either through, or posterior to, the respiratory diaphragm (<a href="../B9780702077050000550/B9780702077050000550.xhtml">Ch. 55</a>). The oesophageal hiatus at the level of the body of the eleventh thoracic vertebra (conventionally reported as at the level of the body of the tenth thoracic vertebra), transmits the oesophagus, anterior and posterior vagal trunks, gastric nerves and oesophageal branches of the left gastric artery. The aortic hiatus at the level of the body of the twelfth thoracic vertebra transmits the aorta, thoracic duct and occasionally the azygos and hemiazygos vein. Apertures within the diaphragmatic crura transmit the thoracic splanchnic nerves; apertures deep to the medial arcuate ligament transmit the sympathetic trunks; minute openings in the central tendon of the respiratory diaphragm transmit small veins.

Aortic pulsations may assist venous return in the azygos and hemiazygos veins, although only a small and variable number of imperfect valves are present. Inferiorly, the azygos vein lies posterior to the oesophagus, from which it is separated by a right-sided pleural recess, the azygo-oesophageal recess. There are age-related differences in the appearance of the contour of this recess on computed tomography (CT); the recess is dextroconvex below the age of 6 years, non-concave (equally divided between straight and convex) between 6 and 12 years of age and concave, as seen in adults, after the age of 12 years of age (<a href="#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">Miller et al 1993</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0085">The major tributaries of the azygos vein are the right intercostal veins (excluding the right supreme (first) intercostal vein that drains into the right brachiocephalic vein), the right superior intercostal vein (usually formed by the union of the second to fourth intercostal veins), the right ascending lumbar and subcostal veins, mediastinal, oesophageal, superior phrenic, pericardial and right bronchial veins, and the hemiazygos and accessory hemiazygos veins.</div><div class="text" id="p0090">Numerous anastomoses exist between the tributaries and the main trunks of the azygos, hemiazygos and accessory hemiazygos veins, the inferior vena cava and the vertebral venous plexuses.

The hemiazygos vein crosses the midline anterior to the body of the eighth or ninth thoracic vertebra, passing posterior to the descending thoracic aorta and oesophagus, and either anterior or posterior to the thoracic duct, to join the azygos vein (see <a href="#f0015">Figs 56.2,</a> <a href="#f0110">56.5B</a>).

Complications of mediastinoscopy include haemorrhage, iatrogenic injury to the trachea or left recurrent laryngeal nerve and pneumothorax. Mediastinoscopy can be performed with video-assisted or direct optic visualization. A transverse incision is made at the level of the jugular (suprasternal) notch; sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles within the superficial lamina of deep cervical fascia are retracted; the deep lamina of the deep cervical fascia is incised. The pretracheal plane is dissected and a space is created between the anterior aspect of the trachea and the brachiocephalic trunk inferior to the carina and along both sides of the trachea and main bronchi. This space facilitates biopsy of the upper paratracheal 2R and 2L stations, the right lower paratracheal 4R station and higher nodes from the left lower paratracheal 4L station superior to the aortic arch (see <a href="../B9780702077050000549/B9780702077050000549.xhtml#f0045">Fig. 54.12B</a>; <a href="#t0010">Table 56.1</a>).

It usually originates anterior to the body of the first or second lumbar vertebra, where the intestinal and two lumbar lymphatic trunks join to form the cisterna chyli. Both the thoracic duct and the cisterna chyli are variable in their origin, course and length; the latter is even more variable in width and shape than the thoracic duct (<a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">Song 2016</a>). From the superior aspect of the cisterna chyli, the thoracic duct passes through the aortic hiatus and enters the posterior mediastinum, lying to the right of the midline, between the descending thoracic aorta and the azygos vein, up to the level of the body of the fifth or sixth thoracic vertebra, where it typically passes to the left, over the vertebral column and posterior to the oesophagus (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 56.7B</a>). It may branch or even have duplicate trunks that eventually form a single thoracic duct (<a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Song 2016</a>). It continues superiorly, first posterior to the aortic arch adjacent to the left side of the oesophagus, then posterior to the left subclavian artery in the superior mediastinum. It subsequently arches over the left subclavian artery and descends anteriorly to empty into the venous circulation in the region of the left internal jugular and subclavian veins, either at their very confluence or in proximity, or sometimes into the left brachiocephalic vein (<a href="#f0105"><span class="bold">Fig. 56.5</span></a>). In the space between longus colli, scalenus anterior and the suprapleural membrane, the duct usually arches 3–4 cm superior to the clavicle, crossing anterior to the vertebral vessels, the left sympathetic trunk, the vertebral sympathetic ganglion, the left thyrocervical trunk and the left phrenic nerve.

Alternatively, the thoracic duct may divide into two or three branches that eventually reunite or drain into both the left and right venous systems. The duct appears sinuous and has valves throughout its length; a bicuspid valve at its termination may prevent the backflow of blood. As it passes through the mediastinum, the thoracic duct also receives non-chylous lymph from tributaries that drain regions of the pulmonary parenchyma and parietal pleura. The sum of these sources accounts for a total lymphatic flow through the thoracic duct of 1500–2400<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>ml per day in proportion to the dietary intake of fat, particularly long-chain triglycerides.</div><div class="text" id="p0190">The thoracic duct crosses the mediastinum at, or at about, the level of the body of the fifth thoracic vertebra which means that lymphatic injury or obstruction above or below this level results in a left- or right-sided pleural effusion (chylothorax), respectively (<a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Doerr et al 2001</a>). Anomalies and sites of injury to the duct are identified by lymphangiography, with or without post-procedure CT scanning, or lymphoscintigraphy. Lymphangiography is performed after bilateral localization of pedal lymphatics with a subcutaneous injection of methylene blue, followed by a minor surgical procedure to cannulate the lymphatic vessels, and injection of Lipiodol contrast agent. Conventional X-ray and CT imaging (without intravenous contrast) are then undertaken.

As well as the cisterna chyli and its tributaries, bilateral ascending lumbar lymphatic trunks from the upper lateral aortic (abdominal part) nodes pierce the corresponding diaphragmatic crus and eventually join the thoracic duct in the posterior mediastinum. The inferior six or seven intercostal lymphatic trunks from the corresponding bilateral intercostal nodes descend to terminate in the duct, either directly or by variable common trunks. The left upper intercostal lymphatics may join the cervical portion of the duct or the subclavian trunk. The left subclavian trunk usually joins the thoracic duct but may open independently into the left subclavian vein. These mediastinal trunks provide lymph drainage paths to the thoracic duct from the convex diaphragmatic aspect of the liver, the respiratory diaphragm, the pericardium, heart and oesophagus; many possess terminal bicuspid valves. The left bronchomediastinal trunk occasionally joins the thoracic duct but usually has an independent venous termination. The left jugular trunk usually joins the thoracic duct but may open independently into the left internal jugular vein (see <a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355.xhtml#f0085">Fig. 35.16</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0125"/><h4 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0125">Injury during oesophageal surgery</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0210">The variable origin, course and length of the thoracic duct, coupled with a failure to identify it during surgery, may lead to inadvertent incision or transection, particularly during trans-hiatal and thoracoscopic oesophageal surgery, with an incidence of 0.2–3% (<a href="#bib50" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_50">Wemyss-Holden et al 2001</a>). Thoracic duct laceration is a potentially life-threatening complication; mortality rates are higher with conservative management but remain elevated even after surgical ligation. Rupture of the thoracic duct leads to leakage of chyle, which is rich in lipid, protein, T lymphocytes (ranging from 400 to 6800 cells/μl), immunoglobulins and fat-soluble vitamins, and hence a progressive nutritional and immune deficit develops. Postoperative chylous effusions are usually the result of damage to ductal tributaries rather than to the duct itself, and are usually self-limiting. The greater incidence of injury with trans-hiatal resection may be attributable to shear forces exerted around the region of the duct during the mobilization of the distal oesophagus, whereas the limited field of view probably contributes to the greater incidence of thoracic duct injury during thoracoscopic surgery. Injury should be suspected in the postoperative period if there is either an enlarging mediastinal silhouette on serial chest radiographs or a significant drainage of milky looking fluid from chest or abdominal drains. An electrophoretic confirmation of the presence of chylomicrons in the pleural fluid is diagnostic amongst other tests. The thoracic duct may be injured during the left cervical approach for the exposure of the vertebral and subclavian arteries or the cervicothoracic (stellate) sympathetic ganglion. However, deliberate ligation of the duct at this level represents an accepted surgical manoeuvre with no particular consequences.<a id="pg1051.e1"/></div></section><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1052" id="pagebreak_1052"/></div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0130"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0130">Right Lymphatic Trunk</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0215">The right lymphatic trunk has a variable anatomy (see <a href="#f0105">Figs 56.5</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355.xhtml#f0085">35.16</a>).

The classic description is that two or more rami communicantes, white (myelinated, preganglionic) and grey (unmyelinated, postganglionic), connect each ganglion with its corresponding spinal nerve, the white rami connecting with the spinal nerve distal to the grey. Variation in this pattern is common, especially at the upper thoracic levels and symmetry is rarely seen. Additional ascending and descending rami communicantes may emerge from the second (54% and 46%, respectively), third (6% and 25%) and fourth ganglia (5% and 8%) (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">Cho et al 2005</a>). Occasionally, a grey and a white ramus fuse to form a ‘mixed’ ramus.

This intrathoracic nerve of Kuntz is thought to carry sympathetic nerve fibres to the brachial plexus without passing through the sympathetic trunk and has been held responsible for the recurrence of symptoms following surgical sympathectomy. The anatomical variation exhibited by the rami communicantes and the location of the second sympathetic ganglion may also contribute to post-surgical symptom recurrence.</div><div class="text" id="p0235">The medial branches from the upper five thoracic ganglia are very small and may supply nerve fibres in a retrograde manner to the thoracic parts of the aorta and its branches as they pass to the cardiac plexuses (<a href="#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_24">Kawashima 2011</a>). Rami of the second to fifth or sixth ganglia enter the posterior pulmonary plexus. Small branches from the pulmonary and cardiac nerves pass to the oesophagus and trachea. The larger medial branches from the lower seven ganglia supply the descending thoracic aorta and then unite to form the greater, lesser and least thoracic splanchnic nerves. The thoracic splanchnic nerves are variable in origin and presence (<a href="#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Irwin et al 2016</a>); the greater thoracic splanchnic nerve is always present, the lesser is usually present and the least is often absent.

It is usually described as being formed by branches from the fifth to ninth or tenth thoracic sympathetic ganglia, but most commonly it originates from the seventh to the ninth thoracic sympathetic ganglia. Its roots vary in number from three to ten. It descends obliquely along the vertebral bodies and intervening intervertebral discs, sends branches to the descending thoracic aorta, and perforates the ipsilateral diaphragmatic crus to terminate mainly in the coeliac but also in the aorticorenal ganglion and suprarenal (adrenal) gland. A thoracic splanchnic ganglion is present on the nerve opposite the body of the eleventh or twelfth thoracic vertebra in most individuals. The lesser thoracic splanchnic nerve is formed commonly by rami of the ninth and tenth thoracic sympathetic ganglia (range, ninth to twelfth). It pierces the respiratory diaphragm with the greater thoracic splanchnic nerve, which it may join, and terminates in the aorticorenal ganglion. The least thoracic splanchnic nerve (or renal nerve) from the lowest thoracic sympathetic ganglion enters the abdomen with the sympathetic trunk and terminates in the renal plexus.

ETS is also effective in frostbite injury, especially if performed within 36–72 hours of cold exposure.</div><div class="text" id="p0255">The operation involves making tiny incisions posterior to the anterior axillary (pectoral) fold in the axilla, and insufflating a small amount of carbon dioxide into the thoracic cavity to allow access with a modified thoracoscope. In the treatment of facial blushing, it is sufficient to divide the nerve fibres that run superiorly from the second thoracic ganglion over the neck of the second rib, leaving the second ganglion almost intact. Treatment of palmar hyperhidrosis requires ablation thermocoagulation of the sympathetic trunk over the necks of the third and fourth ribs, taking care to avoid any spreading of thermal energy along the trunk in order to avoid damaging the more superior stellate ganglion (see Horner’s syndrome below). The risk of compensatory sweating is greatly reduced, though not completely excluded, by limiting the number of ganglia treated to an absolute minimum. As an additional procedure, dividing the inconstant sympathetic pathways (nerve of Kuntz, ascending or descending additional rami communicantes) on the second, third and fourth ribs may improve surgical outcomes. The effect is immediately evident: the patient awakes from anaesthesia with dry, warm hands. In many cases, even hyperhidrosis of the feet improves, but the underlying anatomical and physiological mechanisms are not yet properly understood (<a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Gofeld and Faclier 2006</a>). Surgical complications are rare; Horner’s syndrome is of most concern, and is caused by damage to the stellate ganglion and interruption of the sympathetic nerve fibres from the ventral rami of spinal nerves C8–T1 that ascend around the arteries supplying the head and neck (see <a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355.xhtml#f0095">Fig. 35.18</a>). Side-effects include compensatory sweating (ranging from barely noticeable to profuse) in other locations of the body during exercise or from exposure to high temperatures in up to 70% of patients. Compensatory sweating is severe in 5% of patients, and may be more frequent in those with axillary hyperhidrosis when two more inferior ganglia have to be divided: for this reason, some surgeons do not now consider isolated axillary hyperhidrosis as an indication for this procedure. Gustatory or olfactory sweating may also occur in up to one-third of patients but is rarely considered a problem. Other documented side-effects are the inability to raise the heart rate during increased physical strain/load: in some cases, this has led to decreased ability to perform work and daily activities. Patients can also experience an uncomfortable sensation of not being able to control their body temperature.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0150"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0150">Vagus nerve in the mediastinum</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0265">The vagus nerve contains branchiomotor, general visceral afferent and preganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibres. The proportion of efferent parasympathetic nerve fibres in the vagus nerve varies at different levels but is small relative to its sensory and sensorimotor content. The branchiomotor fibres arise from neurones in the nucleus ambiguus in the medulla oblongata and are distributed to the constrictor muscles of the pharynx and the intrinsic muscles of the larynx. The general visceral afferent fibres carry sensation from thoracic and abdominal viscera and from aortic arch baroreceptors and chemoreceptors and end in the caudal part of the nucleus solitarius of the medulla oblongata. The preganglionic parasympathetic nerves arise from cell bodies in the vagal dorsal nucleus in the medulla oblongata, travel in the nerve and in its pulmonary, cardiac, oesophageal, gastric and intestinal branches and synapse in minute ganglia in the visceral walls (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 56.6</a>) (<a href="#bib32" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_32">Mussa and Verberne 2013</a>). Pulmonary branches contain axons that synapse in ganglia of the pulmonary plexuses: they are motor (bronchoconstrictor) to the circular non-striated muscle fibres of the bronchi and bronchioles (and therefore bring about bronchoconstriction), and secretomotor to the mucous glands of the respiratory epithelium. Cardiac branches join the cardiac plexuses and synapse in ganglia that are distributed freely over both atria in the subepicardial tissue. Postganglionic fibres are distributed to the atria and the atrioventricular bundle and are concentrated around the sinuatrial and, to a lesser extent, the atrioventricular nodes (<a href="../B9780702077050000574/B9780702077050000574.xhtml">Ch. 57</a>). Cardiac branches slow the heart rate and diminish the force of contraction and may indirectly influence ventricular muscle via their effect on the atrioventricular node. The direct postganglionic parasympathetic innervation of the ventricles is sparse. The smaller branches of the coronary arteries are innervated mainly by parasympathetic vagal neurones, whereas the larger arteries are innervated mainly by sympathetic neurones.</div><section><a id="s0155"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0155">Right vagus nerve</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0270">The right vagus nerve descends posterior to the right internal jugular vein in the neck and crosses anterior to the first part of the right subclavian artery to enter the thorax; the ansa subclavia is lateral, and the phrenic nerve is further lateral (see <a href="../B9780702077050000550/B9780702077050000550.xhtml#f0030">Fig. 55.10A</a>).

The greater part of the thymus lies in the anterior mediastinum and the anterior part of the superior mediastinum: its inferior aspect reaches the level of the fourth costal cartilages. In some children, the thymus has been described as encircling the left brachiocephalic vein (<a href="#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_19">Han et al 1989</a>). Superiorly, thymic extensions into the neck are common, reflecting its bilateral embryonic origins from the third pharyngeal pouch (see <a href="../B9780702077050000173/B9780702077050000173.xhtml#f0090">Fig. 17.19</a>).

The left pole usually extends higher and is seen first, sitting posterior to the infrahyoid muscles of the anterior neck during the initial stages of transcervical thymectomy. It sometimes reaches the inferior poles of the thyroid gland or even higher, and is connected to the thyroid gland by the thyrothymic ligament. Its shape conforms to that of adjacent structures. Inferiorly, the right lobe lies between the right side of the ascending aorta and the right lung, anterior to the superior cava. Anteriorly lie sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles, superficial layer of deep cervical fascia, the manubrium of the sternum, the internal thoracic vessels and upper three costal cartilages. The mediastinal parts of the parietal pleurae lie laterally and the phrenic nerves can lie anterolateral and inferior; both structures can be injured during thymectomy. Posteriorly, the thymus is in contact with the vessels of the superior mediastinum (the left brachiocephalic vein and the inferior thyroid veins are usually partly embedded in the gland), the superior part of the thoracic trachea and the fibrous pericardium covering the anterior cardiac surface (right atrium and ventricle).

Innervation is complete by the onset of thymic function.

These steps involve intimate interactions between thymocytes, mainly epithelial and antigen-presenting cells and biomolecular factors in the thymic environment. The thymus is also part of the neuroimmunological and neuroendocrine axes of the body, influenced by and influencing the products of these axes. Its activity therefore varies throughout life under the influence of different physiological states, disease conditions and chemical insults, such as hormones, drugs and pollutants.

Each of the two lobes is partially divided by the ingrowth of shallow septa, so that, superficially, the gland appears lobulated. As fatty atrophy proceeds, this lobulation becomes more distinct. In older adults the thymus may be distinguished from the surrounding mediastinal adipose tissue only by the presence of its capsule. However, even greatly atrophied glands usually contain perivascular areas of persistent lymphoid tissue. Thymocyte production and differentiation persist throughout life, and thymic T cells continue to populate peripheral lymphoid tissue, blood and lymph.</div><section><a id="s0255"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0250">Congenital anomalies of the thymus</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0395">Undescended thymus, accessory thymic bodies and rare cysts of the third pharyngeal pouch are usually of no clinical significance in isolation. Patients with thymic agenesis, aplasia and hypoplasia, as in severe combined immune deficiency disease (SCID), have reduced lymphocyte numbers, and early death from infection is common. Most cases are familial, with autosomal recessive genes. Thymic aplasia is commonly associated with DiGeorge syndrome and deletion of chromosome 22q11.2 and is thought to be a consequence of insufficient neural crest cell migration into the third pharyngeal pouch. In young children, a large normal thymus may press on the trachea, causing episodes of ventilatory stridor. This condition must be differentiated from other congenital conditions such as vascular rings and slings that require surgical correction.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0260"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0255">Thymectomy</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0405">The thymus is essential for the normal development of lymphoid tissues during neonatal and early postnatal life. Thymectomy during this period results in hypoplasia of the peripheral lymphoid organs, wasting and an inability to mount an effective immune response, and is ultimately fatal. By the onset of puberty, when the main lymphoid tissues are fully developed, thymectomy is less debilitating, but effective responses to novel antigens are reduced.</div><div class="text" id="p0410">Thymectomy is commonly performed for myasthenia gravis, usually after referral from a neurologist. The most beneficial effects of thymectomy are seen in myasthenic females who present with systemic muscular weakness; controversial operative groups include the elderly and those with isolated ocular symptoms.</div><div class="text" id="p0415">Thymectomy is performed through a transcervical approach or a sternotomy, the choice of approach depending on the size and disposition of the diseased gland. The cervical approach involves a transverse incision that includes the sternal heads of both sternocleidomastoids, permitting good access to the substernal region (plane). Sternothyroid and sternohyoid are separated and the superior poles of the thymus are identified immediately deep to these muscles. A safe pre-thymic plane is created by blunt dissection just posterior to the sternum, facilitating subsequent mobilization of the gland. The mediastinal great vessels and the thymic vessels must be carefully identified. The thymic veins are selectively ligated and divided, especially those draining directly into the superior vena cava or the left brachiocephalic vein. The smaller arterial branches from the internal thoracic arteries are usually dealt with using electrocautery, care being taken to avoid injury to the phrenic nerves (patients are generally not given a paralytic agent during anaesthesia, so that the phrenic nerves can be identified intraoperatively). The thymus generally remains completely encapsulated and is separated without difficulty from the pericardium (occasionally, adhesions necessitate a limited pericardiectomy). Further inferiorly, a gentle push on the great vessels allows direct visualization into the interval between the aorta and pulmonary trunk to enable complete removal of the thymus in this vicinity. In most cases the thymus is removed completely with both upper and lower poles intact. Careful inspection of the remaining tissue in the mediastinum is performed to identify any possible anatomical anomalies that might result in retained thymic tissue after the operation. The most common anomaly is the unanticipated location of the upper poles of the thymus behind the left brachiocephalic vein. The interval between the aortic arch and pulmonary trunk is also a common location for thymic tissue and this area is sometimes difficult to expose with a transcervical approach. Any suspicious foci of adipose tissue in the mediastinum are removed, and, if necessary, sent for frozen section to ascertain whether or not they contain thymic tissue.</div><section><a id="s9000"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0259">Thymoma and myasthenia gravis</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0430">Thymic tumours may compress the trachea, oesophagus and large veins in the neck, causing hoarseness, cough, dysphagia and venous engorgement of the head and neck. Thymomas tend to have a heterogeneous signal intensity on MRI, often developing in one lobe of the thymus without affecting the other. Many affected patients also have myasthenia gravis or other autoimmune conditions. Myasthenia gravis, a chronic autoimmune disease of adults, presents as a diminution in power of repetitive contraction in certain voluntary muscles. Although there may be more than one condition with these signs, myasthenia gravis is essentially an autoimmune disease in which acetylcholine receptor proteins of neuromuscular junctions are attacked by autoantibodies. Muscles commonly involved are levator palpebrae superioris, leading to ptosis, and the extraocular muscles, leading to diplopia. Other muscles in the face, jaw, neck and limbs may be involved, and in severe cases, the ventilatory muscles are compromised.

The blood from the superficial veins drains into a superficial venous plexus, then into a deeper intrinsic venous plexus and finally into the peri-oesophageal veins via perforating veins. Bidirectional flow is normally possible in this region, a phenomenon that accommodates pressure changes during breathing and Valsalva manoeuvres. However, in portal hypertension, the valves within the perforating vessels become incompetent and blood flow is retrograde, causing dilation (varices) of the deep intrinsic veins. The greater pressure within this region enlarges the varices, which may lead to rapid and life-threatening bleeding. Treatment is directed towards controlling the formation of a collateral circulation and the obliteration of varices that are susceptible to bleeding. This is achieved by paravariceal endoscopic injection of a sclerosant, causing obliteration of the varices as a result of thrombus formation.

Other causes are barotrauma, foreign bodies and oesophageal carcinoma. Barotrauma occurs with intense retching and vomiting that may cause longitudinal tearing in the posterior wall of the thoracic oesophagus (Boerhaave’s syndrome). Locations of oesophageal perforation are 60% thoracic, 25% cervical and 15% abdominal. Perforation in the cervical oesophagus occurs in the posterior wall, where it is at its thinnest, often corresponding to an area of mucosa with minimal muscular covering bordered by the pharyngeal inferior constrictor and cricopharyngeus (see <a href="#f0075">Fig. 56.16</a>). Mortality from oesophageal perforations is 20% and results from mediastinitis and necrotizing infection. Presenting symptoms include thoracic pain, odynophagia, haematemesis, subacute surgical emphysema, tachycardia, breathlessness and, in advanced cases, septic shock. Diagnosis and repair within 24 hours is associated with a better prognosis and a mortality rate of between 10% and 15%, whereas late diagnosis has a much greater mortality rate. For a perforation in the upper two-thirds of the thoracic oesophagus, a right thoracotomy in the fifth or sixth intercostal space is performed. The lower third of the oesophagus is approached through a left thoracotomy in the sixth or seventh intercostal space.

A standard examination involves the patient swallowing a barium solution and gas granules, and images are taken in the erect, supine and prone recumbent positions. The upright posture fully dilates the oesophagus and is useful in evaluating any constrictions. The narrow tubular lumen of the oesophagus is normally indented slightly by the aortic arch and the left main bronchus. The supine view allows better evaluation of any motor dysfunction and varices, and moving into the prone position provokes underlying gastro-oesophageal reflux. Both repeating single digital images and cine loops of fluoroscopy can be obtained. The fluoroscopic images demonstrate defective opening of the pharyngeal (upper) oesophageal sphincter and the nature of the contractions in the body of the oesophagus. The lower oesophageal sphincter can be assessed in achalasia. Other abnormalities, such as hiatal hernia and areas of narrowing or dilation of the oesophagus, can be demonstrated. Mucosal relief images are obtained once the bulk of the contrast media has passed into the stomach, and this provides fine mucosal detail.

In the past, controversy surrounded the reason for this observation because only slight thickening of the muscle coat has been found in humans. There is now ample physiological and clinical evidence that closure depends on two major mechanisms. The more important of these is the lower oesophageal sphincter, a specialized zone of circular smooth muscle surrounding the oesophagus as it traverses the respiratory diaphragm and for much of its short abdominal course. This region of the oesophagus is maintained under tonic contraction, except during swallowing, when it relaxes briefly to admit ingesta to the stomach, and during vomiting. Intramural plexuses of the enteric nervous system and the neural release of nitric oxide contribute to its relaxation. The second mechanism is a functional external sphincter provided by the right crus of the respiratory diaphragm (see <a href="../B9780702077050000550/B9780702077050000550.xhtml#f0040">Fig. 55.1</a>), which encircles the oesophagus as it passes into the abdomen and is attached to it by the phrenico-oesophageal ligament. Fluoroscopy, electromyography and manometry have shown that its muscular fibres contract around the oesophagus during inspiration and when <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1062" id="pagebreak_1062"/><a id="pg1061.e1"/>intra-abdominal pressure is increased, thus helping to prevent gastro-oesophageal reflux, even when the lower oesophageal sphincter is inhibited experimentally with atropine. The relative importance of these two agents in the prevention of oesophageal reflux is still a matter for debate. Clinically, there is a good correlation between this condition and lower oesophageal sphincter dysfunction in some cases, whereas in others failure of the respiratory diaphragmatic component, as seen in hiatus hernia, appears to be a major factor. The anatomical configuration of the gastro-oesophageal junction may also play some part in these processes.</div><section><a id="s0405"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0390">Swallowing</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0690">The oesophageal phase of swallowing is described in <a href="../B9780702077050000409/B9780702077050000409.xhtml">Chapter 40</a>.</div></section><section><a id="s0410"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0395">Vomiting</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0695">In the initial phase of vomiting, the lower oesophageal sphincter and peri-oesophageal crural muscle fibres simultaneously relax and rapid diaphragmatic and abdominal muscular contraction commences, increasing intra-abdominal pressure.</div></section></section><section><a id="s4532"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0400">Oesophageal dysmotility</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0700">Oesophageal dysmotility encompasses disorders of the upper and lower oesophageal sphincters (see gastro-oesophageal reflux in <a href="../B978070207705000063X/B978070207705000063X.xhtml">Chapter 63</a>), congenital anomalies such as atresia, and achalasia.

Dysphagia, regurgitation of undigested food and retrosternal chest pain result and a posteroanterior chest radiograph may show dilation of the oesophagus and retention of food products as a mottled, double-contoured mediastinal widening. Barium swallow shows a classic ‘bird-beak’ appearance as a result of failure of relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter and an absence of peristalsis. Oesophageal pressure manometry demonstrates absent or impaired relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter. Treatment options are endoscopic pneumatic balloon dilation or laparoscopic cardiomyotomy (Heller’s myotomy). Alternatively, intrasphincteric <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1063" id="pagebreak_1063"/><a id="pg1063"/>injection of botulinum toxin may be offered in frail patients and confers lower morbidity and mortality.</div><div class="text" id="p0710">Diffuse oesophageal spasm may present with dysphagia and chest pain.

Manometry also demonstrates these tetanic contractions. Non-specific oesophageal motility disorder occurs with ageing (presbyoesophagus) and is characterized by a decreased incidence of normal or even absent peristalsis after swallowing, often accompanied by repetitive tertiary contractions and failure of relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter.

The subaortic node station (located in the aortopulmonary window/interval) is located between the aortic arch superiorly, the left pulmonary artery inferiorly, the trachea medially and the left lung laterally. The right paratracheal space is between the right lung and the trachea on its anterolateral aspect; the posterior tracheal space is between the lung and the posterolateral aspect of the trachea; and the subcarinal space inferior to the carina is bounded by the main bronchi. On the right, the azygo-oesophageal recess (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 56.7A</a>) is located posterior to the subcarinal space and on the left side is the oesophagus. All these areas are in direct continuity with each other and are inspected during transcervical mediastinoscopy.</div><div class="text" id="p0765">The junctional areas are where the right and left lungs approach and often contact each other at the median plane. The anterior junction lies between the great vessels posteriorly, the posterior surface of the sternum and adjacent thoracic wall anteriorly, and the lungs laterally, specifically in the region where the left brachiocephalic vein, superiorly located mediastinal nodes, thymus and phrenic nerves are located. The posterior junction is an area posterior to the trachea and is where the pleurae-covered lungs appose. The paraspinal area (thoracic paravertebral space) lies between the lateral margins of the vertebral column and the pleurae covering the lungs and contains the intercostal vessels, the ganglionated sympathetic trunk and small lymph nodes surrounded by adipose tissue. The retrocrural space, between the diaphragmatic crura and vertebral bodies, is traversed by the descending thoracic aorta, azygos venous system, thoracic duct, intercostal arteries, sympathetic trunks and sympathetic thoracic splanchnic nerves.</div><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1065"
