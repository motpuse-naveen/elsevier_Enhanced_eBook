By the time the neural tube closes these grooves have evaginated to form paired optic vesicles in the prosencephalon. The distal portion of the optic vesicle neuroepithelium underlying the surface ectoderm invaginates to form a bilayered optic cup, with the simultaneous invagination and separation of the overlying surface ectoderm to form the lens vesicle. The proximal portion of the optic vesicle forms the optic stalk connecting the optic cup to the diencephalon. These morphogenetic events form the rudimentary eye by stage 16 (postfertilization days 37–38). The optic cup and stalk are initially incomplete along the ventral surface forming the optic (choroidal) fissure. The primitive vasculature of the lens (the hyaloid artery) extends through the fissure, which closes by stage 17–18 (postfertilization days 39–44). Differentiation of the inner and outer layers of the embryonic optic cup generates the neural retina and the retinal pigmented epithelium respectively, and the lens vesicle matures into the transparent lens fibre filled capsule.

These are the neurectoderm of the forebrain (which forms the sensory retina and accessory pigmented structures), the surface ectoderm (which forms the lens and the corneal epithelium) and the intervening neural crest mesenchyme (which contributes to the fibrous coats of the eye and to tissues of the anterior segment of the eye).

This optic primordium (eye field) extends on both sides of the neural plate and crosses the midline at the primordium chiasmatis. A slight transverse indentation, the optic sulcus, appears in the inner surface of the optic primordium on each side of the brain. During rostral neuropore closure in stage 11 the walls of the neuromere diencephalon 1 (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0015">Fig. 14.2</a>) begin to evaginate at the optic sulcus, projecting laterally towards the surface ectoderm and by stage 13 (postfertilization days 31–33), the optic vesicles are formed. Failure of the specification and development of the optic vesicle is associated with mutation of several transcriptional regulatory genes expressed in the eye field and leads to anophthalmia (absence of the eye) (<a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_13">Graw 2003</a>). Each optic vesicle is surrounded by a sheath of mesenchymal cells derived from the head mesenchyme and neural crest; its lumen is continuous with that of diencephalon 1. Regional differentiation is apparent in each of the source tissues of the eye. The optic vesicle is visibly differentiated into its three primary parts. At the junction with the diencephalon, a thick-walled region marks the future optic stalk; laterally, the tissue that will become the sensory (neural) retina forms a flat disc of thickened epithelium in close contact with the surface ectoderm; and the thin-walled part that lies between these regions will later form the pigmented layer of the retina (retinal pigmented epithelium). The area of surface ectoderm that is closely apposed to the distal optic vesicle thickens to form the lens placode, and the mesenchymal sheath of the vesicle begins to show signs of angiogenesis. During stage 14 (postfertilization days 33–34), the lens placode and optic vesicle undergo coordinated morphogenesis. Filopodia tether the presumptive optic and lens vesicles to coordinate epithelial invagination. The lens placode invaginates, forming a pit that pinches off from the surface ectoderm to form the lens vesicle (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 15.1</span></a>). The surface ectoderm reforms a continuous layer that will become the corneal epithelium. The lateral part of the optic vesicle invaginates to form a cup, which is incompletely formed and open at the ventral surface (optic fissure); the inner layer (facing the lens vesicle) will become the sensory (neural) retina, and the outer layer, influenced by signals from the surrounding extraocular mesenchyme, becomes the retinal pigmented epithelium. As a result of these folding movements, what had been the apical (luminal) surfaces of the presumptive neural retina and retinal pigmented epithelium of the optic vesicle now face one another across a much-reduced lumen, the intraretinal space. The pigmented layer becomes attached to the mesenchymal sheath, but the junction between the pigmented and sensory layers is less firm and is the site of pathological detachment of the retina. The two layers are continuous at the lip of the cup (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 15.2</span></a>). The narrow part of the optic vesicle between the base of the cup and the brain forms the optic stalk. The distal part of the optic stalk also invaginates, forming a wide groove, the choroid (optic) fissure, through which mesenchyme migrates and differentiates to form the ingressing hyaloid artery. These infoldings involve differential growth, changes in cell shape, cell movement and high levels of proliferation in the inner neuroepithelial layer. The hyaloid artery forms part of the vasculature of the eye. It transiently supplies the developing lens and the inner part of the retina until a retinal vasculature forms and eventually regresses by apoptosis (<a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_22">Lutty and McLeod 2018</a>).</div><section><a id="s0035"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000015X/main.assets/f15-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 15.1</span> Development and morphogenesis of the optic cup. <span class="bold">A–D</span>, Scanning electron micrographs of early eye development, <span class="bold">A</span> and <span class="bold">C</span> showing external view, <span class="bold">B</span> and <span class="bold">D</span> showing longitudinal sections through the eye. <span class="bold">B</span> and <span class="bold">E</span> show the early invagination of the lens placode and the modification of the optic vesicle to an optic cup. <span class="bold">D</span> and <span class="bold">F</span> show the formation of the lens vesicle and the two layers of the retina (nervous and pigmented). <span class="bold">G</span> and <span class="bold">H</span> show three-dimensional images of the outer aspect of the optic cup. <span class="bold">G</span>, Early formation of the choroid fissure along the side of the optic cup and optic stalk; the layers of the retina are shown. <span class="bold">H</span>, The fused choroid fissure; the position of the lens within the optic cup is shown in dotted outline. <br/><span class="figcredit">A–D, Courtesy of Kathleen Sulik PhD, Professor, University of North Carolina.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000015X/main.assets/f15-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 15.2</span> Sections through the developing eyes of human embryos. <span class="bold">A</span>, The thick nervous and the thinner pigmented layers of the developing retina and the lens at about stage 16.

The fusion process is characterized by apoptosis at the margins of the fissure. Failure of the optic fissure to close is a rare anomaly that may be accompanied by a corresponding deficiency in the choroid, retina and iris (congenital coloboma) and is often associated with microphthalmia (small eyes). Reduced growth of the optic cup caused by mutation of the homeobox gene <span class="italic">VSX2</span>, important for specification and growth of the neural retina, is one known cause of microphthalmia (<a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Graw 2003</a>).

The next phase of development involves further patterning and phenotypic differentiation in order to develop the specialized structures of the adult organ needed for focusing and sensing of light.</div><div class="text" id="p0040">The optic cup becomes patterned, from the base to the rim, into regions with distinct functions. Several secreted factors, including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), retinoic acid and SHH, and transcriptional regulator genes, including <span class="italic">PAX6</span> and <span class="italic">PAX2</span>, are important for specifying each region (<a href="#bib5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Chow and Lang 2001</a>, <a href="#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Sinn and Wittbrodt 2013</a>). The outer layer of the optic cup remains as a thin layer of cells, which begin to acquire pigmented melanosomes and form the pigmented epithelium of the retina at stage 17. In a parallel process that begins before invagination, the cells of the inner layer of the cup proliferate to form a thick pseudostratified neuroepithelium, the future neural retina, over the base and sides of the cup. The peripheral region around the lip of the cup extends, and is further differentiated into the components of the prospective iris at the rim, and the ciliary body a little further back, adjacent to the neural retina (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 15.2</a>). The development of this pattern is reflected in regional differences in the expression of various genes that encode transcriptional regulators and that are therefore likely to play key roles in controlling and coordinating development. Distinct sets of genes are expressed prior to and during overt cell-type differentiation. For example, <span class="italic">PAX6</span> is expressed in the prospective ciliary and iris regions of the optic cup; individuals heterozygous for mutations in <span class="italic">PAX6</span> lack an <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="265" id="pagebreak_265"/><a id="pg265"/>iris (aniridia), suggesting a causal role for this gene in the development of the iris. The genes expressed in the eye are also often active at a variety of other specific sites in the embryo. This may, in part, account for the co-involvement of the eye and other organs in syndromes that result from single genetic lesions, e.g. <span class="italic">PAX2</span> mutation causes coloboma and kidney defects (<a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Graw 2003</a>).</div><section><a id="s0020"/><section><a id="s0025"/><h3 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0030">Developing neural retina</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0045">The developing neural retina consists of an outer nuclear zone, which contains dividing neuroepithelial retinal progenitor cells, and an inner marginal zone, which is initially devoid of nuclei. At about stage 16 the cells of the nuclear zone invade the marginal zone, and by stage 18 the nervous stratum of the retina consists of inner and outer neuroblastic layers. Cell lineage analyses have shown that seven retinal cell types are all derived from a common multipotential retinal progenitor cell that undergoes mitosis at the apical (ventricular) surface. Different types of retinal cells are born (i.e. cease dividing) in a conserved sequence during development: ganglion cells, amacrine cells, cone photoreceptors and horizontal cells develop early, whereas bipolar cells, rod photoreceptors and Müller glial cells develop later (<a href="#bib4" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_4">Cepko et al 1996</a>). Newly born cells migrate from the apical (ventricular) surface to the appropriate cell layer in the developing retina, establishing its characteristic laminar structure. The developing ganglion cell layer first separates from the neuroblastic layers by formation of the inner plexiform layer. The inner nuclear layer, containing developing amacrine, horizontal, bipolar and Müller glial cells, is then separated from the outer nuclear layer, containing the developing rod and cone photoreceptors, by the formation of the outer plexiform layer. Mature retinal neurones first appear in the central part of the retina. By postmenstrual weeks 29–32 all the named layers of the retina can be identified. The photoreceptor cells continue to differentiate after birth, generating an array of increasing resolution and sensitivity; the macula does not reach maturity until 15–45 months after birth (<a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Hendrickson and Yuodelis 1984</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0050">The divergent differentiation of the pigmented and sensory layers of the retina from the initially bipotential neuroepithelium of the optic vesicle involves activation of region-specific regulatory genes, e.g. <span class="italic">VSX2</span> in the presumptive neural retina and <span class="italic">MITF</span> in the presumptive pigmented epithelium (<a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_1">Bharti et al 2006</a>). Patterning by gene expression is an important aspect of establishing regional identity of the optic cup and the subsequent maturation of these respective tissues. Soluble factors from the retina elicit the polarized distribution of plasma membrane proteins and the formation of tight junctions in the pigmented epithelium. Neural retinal differentiation is mediated by several growth factors, including fibroblast growth factors, SHH and retinoic acid. Basic helix–loop–helix proneural transcriptional regulatory genes also play a central role in regulating retinal cell fate. However, the pigmented epithelium initially retains the potential to become neural retina and will do so if the embryonic retina is wounded, demonstrating the plasticity of the early commitment to pigment epithelium or neural retinal fate.</div><div class="text" id="p0055">The retinal vasculature forms by the aggregation of spindle-shaped cells (vascular mesenchymal cells) that emanate from the optic disc by postmenstrual week 15 and form vascular cords, consistent with vessel formation by vasculogenesis, which give rise to the inner plexus of the retina. Vessel formation in the temporal and peripheral retina occurs by angiogenesis. New vessel segments sprout by endothelial cell migration from pre-existing vessels and grow tangentially by angiogenesis into the neuroepithelium (<a href="#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Hughes et al 2000</a>). Three parallel interconnected vascular networks located in the nerve fibre and plexiform layers develop with arteries and veins entering and exiting through the optic nerve. The foveal area never develops a retinal vasculature (<a href="#bib32" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_32">Provis and Hendrickson 2008</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0035">Optic nerve</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0060">The optic nerve develops from the optic stalk. The centre of the optic cup, where the optic fissure is deepest, will later form the optic disc, at the transition zone where the neural retina is continuous with the corresponding invaginated cell layer of the optic stalk; the developing <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="266" id="pagebreak_266"/><a id="pg266"/>axons of the ganglion cells, therefore, pass directly into the wall of the stalk and convert it into the optic nerve. Retinal ganglion cell axons projecting into the stalk promote the optic stalk neuroepithelium to differentiate into astrocytes. Myelination of the axons within the optic nerve begins shortly before birth but the process is not completed until some time later. The optic chiasma is formed by the meeting and partial decussation of the axons within the two optic nerves in the ventral part of the lamina terminalis (at the junction of the telencephalon with the diencephalon in the floor of the third ventricle). Beyond the chiasma, the axons continue as the optic tracts, and pass principally to the lateral geniculate bodies and to the superior tectum of the midbrain. Multiple axonal guidance molecules that influence both intraretinal and chiasmal axon guidance have been identified (<a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Erskine and Herrera 2014</a>). Graded expression molecules (members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinase receptors and ephrin ligands) provide spatial identity to cells in the retina and target cells in the midbrain, and are important for the topographic mapping of retinal ganglion cell axons to form a projection map that is representative of visual input.</div><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0040">Ciliary body</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0065">The ciliary body is a compound structure. Its epithelial components are derived from the region of the inner layer of the retina, between the iris and the neural retina, and the adjacent outer layer of pigmented epithelium.

The muscles of the sphincter and dilator pupillae are unusual in that they are of neurectodermal origin, developing as a result of the further growth and differentiation of the two layers of the optic cup. Mesenchymal cells, largely composed of neural crest cells that have migrated anterior to the lens, form the collagen-rich iris stroma; they overlay the pigmented epithelium of the iris, which is continuous with the ciliary body and retina and is of neurectodermal origin. The mature colour of the iris develops after birth and is dependent on the relative contributions of the pigmented epithelium on the posterior surface of the iris and the neural crest-derived melanocytes in the mesenchymal stroma of the iris. If only epithelial pigment is present, the eye appears blue, whereas if there is an additional contribution from the melanocytes, the eye appears brown.

Initially, this is a hollow ball of actively proliferating epithelium, but by stage 16 there is a discernible difference between the thin anterior (i.e. outward-facing) epithelium and the thickened posterior epithelium. Cells of the posterior wall lengthen and fill the vesicle (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 15.2B,C</a>), reducing the original cavity to a slit by about stage 18. The posterior cells lose their mitochondria and nuclei and become filled with a very high concentration of proteins (crystallins), that render them transparent; they also become densely packed within the lens as primary lens fibres. Cells at the equatorial region of the lens subsequently elongate and contribute secondary lens fibres to the body of the lens in a process that continues into adult life, sustained by continued proliferation of cells in the anterior epithelium.</div><div class="text" id="p0085">The polarity and growth of the lens appear to depend on the differential distribution of soluble factors that promote either cell division or lens fibre differentiation, and are present in the anterior chamber and vitreous humour, respectively.

The posterior part of the capsule is supplied by branches from the hyaloid artery, and the anterior part, the pupillary membrane, is supplied by branches from the anterior ciliary arteries. During postmenstrual weeks 13–16 the hyaloid artery gives off retinal branches. By postmenstrual weeks 21–24 all of the vessels have atrophied, except the hyaloid artery; this becomes occluded during postmenstrual weeks 29–32, although its proximal part persists in the adult as the central artery of the retina. Atrophy of the hyaloid vasculature and of the pupillary membrane appears to be an active process of programmed tissue remodelling that is macrophage-dependent; visual impairment occurs in persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, a condition in which normal regression of the hyaloid vasculature fails to occur. The hyaloid canal carries the vessels through the vitreous and persists after they have become occluded. In the full-term neonate, the canal extends more or less horizontally from the optic disc to the posterior aspect of the lens, but when the adult eye is examined with a slit-lamp, it can be seen to follow an undulating course, sagging downwards as it passes forwards to the lens. With the loss of its blood vessels, the vascular capsule disappears and the lens becomes dependent for its nutrition on diffusion via the aqueous and vitreous humours. The lens remains enclosed in the lens capsule, a thickened basal lamina derived from the lens epithelium. Sometimes, the pupillary membrane persists at birth, giving rise to congenital atresia of the pupil.</div></section><section><a id="s0050"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0055">Vitreous humour (vitreous body)</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0095">The vitreous humour develops between the lens and the optic cup as a transparent, avascular gel of extracellular substance stabilized by collagen fibrils. The vitreous proteins are derived from surrounding tissues including the developing ciliary body. Initially the lens rudiment and the optic vesicle are in contact, but they draw apart after closure of the lens vesicle and formation of the optic cup, and remain connected by a network of delicate cytoplasmic processes. This network, derived partly from cells of the lens and partly from those of the retina, is the primitive vitreous body. At first, these cytoplasmic processes are connected to the whole of the neuroretinal area of the cup but, later, they become limited to the ciliary region, where, by a process of condensation, they form the basis of the zonular fibres (suspensory ligaments) of the ciliary zonule. The vascular mesenchyme enters the cup through the choroidal fissure and around the equator of the lens and associates locally with this reticular tissue and thus contributes to the formation of the vitreous body.</div></section><section><a id="s0055"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0060">Anterior segment</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0100">Neural crest mesenchymal cells migrate ventrally around the optic cup and between the surface ectoderm and the lens to contribute to the development of anterior segment structures, including the ciliary body, the iris, the cornea and the iridocorneal angle tissues (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 15.2C–E</a>) (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Gould et al 2004</a>). The anterior chamber initially appears as a cleft in this mesenchymal tissue. The mesenchyme superficial to the cleft forms the stroma (substantia propria) and endothelium of the cornea, and that deep to the cleft forms the stroma of the iris and the pupillary membrane. Tangentially, this early cleft extends as far as the iridocorneal angle, where communications are established with the scleral venous sinus (canal of Schlemm). Mesenchymal cells of neural crest origin lying at the angle of the anterior chamber differentiate to form a specialized meshwork of trabecular beams (collagen fibrils covered by cells). The open spaces of the meshwork become open to the anterior chamber as the beams develop. The scleral venous sinus develops deep to the trabecular meshwork. Initially a vascular structure lined by endothelial cells, the canal acts as an aqueous sinus during postmenstrual weeks 17–20 (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">McMenamin 1989</a>). The forward-growing optic cup rim differentiates into the ciliary epithelium and the iris; the posterior chamber is formed between the iris, the lens capsule, the zonular fibres and the ciliary processes. The latter produce the aqueous humour that flows through the pupil and is drained in the iridocorneal angle, mainly by the trabecular meshwork and the scleral venous sinus. In this way, the walls of the anterior and posterior segment chambers furnish both the sites of production, and the channels for circulation and reabsorption, of the aqueous humour. The <span class="italic">FOXC1</span> and <span class="italic">PITX2</span> transcriptional regulatory genes are expressed in the neural crest cells migrating into the presumptive anterior segment, and regulate differentiation of the anterior segment tissues. Anterior segment dysgenesis, involving malformation of the iris, cornea and angle, occurs when these genes are mutated (e.g. Axenfeld–Rieger syndrome) and is often associated with raised intraocular pressure and glaucoma (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Gould et al 2004</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0060"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0065">Cornea</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0105">The cornea is induced in the front of the anterior chamber by the lens and optic cup. The (external) corneal epithelium is formed from surface ectoderm. The primordial corneal endothelium lining the front of the anterior chamber (inner corneal epithelium) is formed from neural crest mesenchymal cells that migrate along the inner surface of the developing cornea and differentiate to form specialized fibroblasts (keratocytes) that secrete the extracellular matrix of the corneal stroma (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 15.2C–E</a>). A regular array of collagen fibres (lamellae) is established between inner and outer corneal epithelial layers and serves to reduce scattering of light entering the eye. The most anterior region of the stroma (Bowman’s layer) develops as an acellular zone packed with collagen fibrils that confer strength on the layer. From postmenstrual weeks 9–12, the corneal endothelium is organized as a monolayer of cells and develops a strong, laminated basal lamina (Descemet’s membrane) adjacent to the stroma. The endothelium maintains corneal transparency by regulating the water content of the stroma.</div></section><section><a id="s0065"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0070">Choroid and sclera</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0110">The choroid and sclera differentiate as inner vascular and outer fibrous layers, respectively, from the neural crest mesenchyme that surrounds the optic cup. The choroid is continuous with the leptomeningeal internal sheath of the optic nerve, and the sclera is continuous with the outer dural sheath of the optic nerve. Choroidal vasculature can be seen by stage 18 around the retinal pigmented epithelium. It forms a complete vascular plexus by postmenstrual weeks 21–22, supplying the photoreceptor cells and the ciliary body (<a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Lutty and McLeod 2018</a>).</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0070"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0075">Differentiation of Structures Around the Eye</h2><section><a id="s0075"/><section><a id="s0080"/><h3 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0080">Extraocular muscles</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0115">Development of the extrinsic ocular muscles is complex, involving coordinated juxtaposition of specific muscle precursors, cranial motor nerve outgrowth and neural crest mesenchyme. During gastrulation, when the earliest cells are migrating through the primitive node to form the prechordal plate and notochordal process, they transiently express myogenic markers. In stages 9–10 a population of prechordal mesenchyme cells migrate laterally from the lateral edge of the prechordal plate toward the unsegmented paraxial mesenchyme on each side of the notochord. After neurulation is complete, bilateral premandibular, intermediate and caudal cavities develop adjacent to the neural tube. The walls of these ‘head cavities’, previously termed ‘preotic somites’, are lined by flat or cylindrical cells that do not exhibit the characteristics of a germinal epithelium.</div><div class="text" id="p0120">At the level of the premandibular head cavity, as the oculomotor nerve grows towards the developing eye, the prechordal mesenchyme becomes apparent as a condensation of premuscle cells at its ventrolateral side. This condensation later subdivides into the blastema of the superior, inferior, medial and lateral recti and inferior oblique. Similar events occur in the intermediate head cavity associated with the trochlear nerve and the premuscle cells that form superior oblique, and the caudal head cavity associated with the abducens nerve and premuscle cells that form lateral rectus (see <a href="../B9780702077050000124/B9780702077050000124.xhtml#f0025">Figs 12.4</a> and <a href="../B9780702077050000173/B9780702077050000173.xhtml#f0040">17.7</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0125">The early myogenic properties of the prechordal mesenchyme have been demonstrated experimentally.

Myotube formation starts later and progresses at a slower pace than in the limb, and coexpression of MyHCI/1<sup>st</sup> and MyHCI/2<sup>nd</sup> are both seen from the earliest stages of development, whereas only MyHCI/1<sup>st</sup> is seen in the limb. These early myoblasts retain their distinct differences from other skeletal muscles as they mature: they are smaller, loosely arranged and belong to very small motor units (<a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_31">Porter and Baker 1996</a>, <a href="#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">Pedrosa-Domellöf et al 2000</a>).

During postmenstrual weeks 10–11 their edges come together and unite over the cornea to enclose the conjunctival sac; they usually remain united until about postmenstrual week 24. When the eyelids open, the conjunctiva lining their inner surfaces and covering the scleral region of the eye fuses with the corneal epithelium. Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α) and several other growth factors regulate the mesenchyme–epithelium interactions and cell migration that are required for eyelid formation; keratinization is thought to play an important role in lid separation. The eyelashes and lid glands, i.e. sebaceous glands associated with the eyelashes and tarsal (Meibomian) glands, develop from ectoderm, as do the lacrimal and accessory lacrimal glands. Orbicularis oculi, which closes the eyelids, develops on each side from skeletal myoblasts from the second pharyngeal arch that invade the developing eyelids. The muscles that widen the palpebral fissure develop within the orbit from mesenchymal cells; the superior and inferior tarsal muscles are smooth muscle, whereas levator palpebrae superioris is striated muscle that is attached to each upper eyelid by a tendon derived from the neural crest (<a href="#bib30" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_30">Plock et al 2005</a>).

The lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct are derived from ectoderm in the nasomaxillary groove (between the lateral nasal process and the maxillary process of the developing face) (see <a href="../B9780702077050000173/B9780702077050000173.xhtml#f0065">Fig. 17.12</a>). The ectoderm thickens to form a solid cord of cells, the nasolacrimal ridge, which subsequently sinks into the mesenchyme and becomes canalized during postmenstrual weeks 9–12 to form the nasolacrimal duct. The lacrimal canaliculi arise from the cranial extremity of the cord as buds that establish openings (puncta lacrimalia) on the margins of the lids. The inferior canaliculus isolates a small part of the lower eyelid to form the lacrimal caruncle and plica semilunaris.</div></section><section><a id="s0095"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0095">Neonatal and infant eye</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0140">Low birthweight and preterm infants are at risk of developing retinopathy of prematurity, a proliferative retinopathy involving proliferation of the retinal vasculature into the vitreous (<a href="#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_21">Kashani et al 2014</a>, <a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Hartnett et al 2014</a>, <a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Hartnett 2015</a>). Fetuses and preterm infants younger than postmenstrual week 30 have no pupillary light reflex or pupillary constriction, with variable responses developing until postmenstrual weeks 32–34. Fetuses are not exposed to light. Preterm neonates born at less than postmenstrual week 32 have little ability to limit the light entering the eye because their eyelids are mostly open and are very thin when closed (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">Graven 2004</a>).

Retinal development in the fetus is active between postmenstrual weeks 22 and 40, becoming associated with REM sleep from about postmenstrual weeks 28–30. Eye movement activity is seen in fetuses particularly during postmenstrual weeks 28–29 and then again from postmenstrual weeks 36–37 to 38–39 (<a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_28">Okawa et al 2017</a>).

They will be susceptible to strong competing stimuli such as intense noise, pain, movement and bright light; sedation that changes sleep patterns may also affect retinal maturation (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Graven 2004</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0145">At full term (postmenstrual week 40), the eye is 65% of its adult size. It grows rapidly for the first year, slightly slower until 3 years and then more slowly until puberty. There is proportionately less growth of anterior, compared to posterior, structures and the globe of the eye becomes more spherical. The neonatal lens is more spherical than that of the adult, which helps to compensate for the relative shortness of the eye. The visual acuity of neonates is estimated to be 20/400 and can reach 20/30–20/20 by 2–3 years of age; there is a general trend for infants to be far-sighted (<a href="#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Olitsky et al 2011</a>).

Extraocular muscle coordination is usually achieved by postnatal months 3–6and persistent deviation of an eye requires evaluation.

The visual pathways, lateral geniculate body and occipital visual cortex are patterned postnatally by exposure to visual stimuli. By postmenstrual weeks 38–40 neonates focus on the edges of objects, lines, shapes and movement, and focus their attention to the human face (preferably main caregiver). Each shape patterns columns of neurones within the visual cortex; direct light into the eyes does not create columns. Colour input becomes attached to patterned directional columns from postnatal months 2–3. The critical period for visual development occurs from the end of the second trimester to postnatal year 3 (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Graven 2004</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0155">Any condition that impedes the generation of aligned, high-resolution images on the retina may result in amblyopia due to loss of appropriate patterning of these brain regions from the deprived eye, followed by progressive expansion of axonal input from the functioning eye. The visual cortex of animals dark reared from birth remains immature, whereas specific use of the affected eye promotes reversal of cortical inhibition (<a href="#bib35" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_35">Stryker and Löwel 2018</a>). Amblyopia affects about 1–5% of people, caused by strabismus and anisometropia, where the two eyes have different focusing powers. Examination of the eyes is part of neonatal screening, performed within 72 hours of delivery and again at postnatal weeks 6–8; the assessment includes the red reflex, which is the reflection of the back of the retina seen in flash photography that may be changed in congenital cataract, retinoblastoma or neuroblastic tumour. It is difficult to assess visual acuity in infants and techniques rely on assessing preferential looking. Over 90% of children with amblyopia have significant refractive error that should be treated ahead of any strabismus. Treatment of amblyopia has been occlusion of vision in the unaffected eye with a patch to force reliance on the amblyopic eye and thus patterning of the lateral geniculate body and visual cortex. Studies on the effectiveness of this treatment have shown that children benefit most from 3–6 hours of occlusion per day for a period of 3 months. Although occlusion is the usual treatment modality, atropine eye drops, causing blurring of vision by pupillary dilation, or computer games that present images separately to each eye with reduced contrast to the unaffected eye, are considered promising. These treatments have been shown to improve vision but the residual deficit in children with moderate amblyopia is 2 lines of a visual acuity chart (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Jefferis et al 2015</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0160">Growth of the eyeball and achievement of the appropriate axial length to focus correctly onto the retina is associated with daylight entering the eyes over childhood.
