The first source to be clearly delineated is the neural plate, which gives rise to the central nervous system (CNS), the somatic motor nerves and the preganglionic autonomic nerves. The second source is from cells at the perimeter of the neural plate, neural crest cells, which remove themselves by epithelial to mesenchymal transition from the plate and migrate away just prior to its fusion into a neural tube. These cells give rise to the majority of the neurones and glia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), i.e. the somatic sensory nerves, the somatic and autonomic ganglia, postganglionic autonomic nerves and suprarenal and chromaffin cells, as well as significant mesenchymal populations in the head. The third source is from ectodermal placodes, focal thickenings of the ectoderm covering the embryonic head, that contribute cells to the cranial sensory neurones and form the olfactory epithelia, the epithelia of the inner ear and, by a non-neuronal contribution, the lens of the eye. Early establishment of a pial capillary network, derived from mesenchymal neural crest cells, provides cell lines for neuroepithelial:endothelial interactions throughout the developing nervous system.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0010"/><hgroup><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Neurulation</h2><h3 class="h2after1" id="cesectitle0025">Primary neurulation</h3></hgroup><section><a id="s0015"/><div class="textfl" id="p0045">Primary neurulation begins at stage 9 and is completed during stage 12 (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0010"><span class="bold">Figs 14.1</span></a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0015"><span class="bold">14.2</span></a>) (embryonic stages 10–23 correlated to postfertilization days of development and postmenstrual weeks of pregnancy are shown in <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 23.3</a>). The process is continuous spatially and temporally but has been envisaged as four stages. It begins with local elongation of the ectoderm cells in a midline zone of the embryonic disc and their reorganization into a pseudostratified epithelium, the neural plate. This is followed by reshaping and bending of the neural plate into a neural groove that subsequently closes to form a neural tube bidirectionally from its mid portion to its cranial and caudal ends. A continuous surface ectoderm forms dorsal to the tube. As neurulation proceeds, the neural tube elongates by convergent extension, a process where the apical surfaces of adjacent cells narrow (convergence) and there is rostrocaudal elongation (extension) (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_22">Bay and Caspary 2012</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib116" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_116">Nikolopoulou et al 2017</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000148/main.assets/f14-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 14.1</span> A scanning electron micrograph of a neurulating rat embryo comparable to a stage 10 human embryo.

The initial fusion site, termed α, or the dorsal lip of the rostral neuropore, is in the rhombencephalic region from which closure extends both rostrally and caudally. A second site, termed β, or the terminal lip of the rostral neuropore, forms in the prosencephalic region and extends caudally (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib120" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_120">O’Rahilly and Müller 2002</a>). Closure of the rostral neuropore is completed in stage 11 when about 19–20 pairs of somites are present. Continued generation of the neural plate from the primitive node adds caudal regions to the elongating and closing neural tube and generation of mesenchyme from the primitive streak adds paraxial mesenchymal populations that form somites as the neural tube closes (<a href="../B9780702077050000185/B9780702077050000185.xhtml">Ch. 18</a>). Primary neurulation ends and the caudal neuropore starts to close in stage 12 (30–32 days postfertilization, see <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 23.3</a>), when approximately 29 somites are present: the final site of closure corresponds to the level of the future somite 31 (the level of the future second sacral vertebra) (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib121" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_121">O’Rahilly and Müller 2004</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0055">Primary neurulation depends on cellular changes within the neural plate; and may also also involve movements of the paraxial mesenchyme in the trunk. Initial fusion of the surface ectoderm is followed by fusion of the neural ectoderm. The neural ectodermal cells become elongated and then wedge-shaped. The forces needed to shape the neural tube are intrinsic to the cells of the neurectoderm: human embryonic stem cells can self-organize into three-dimensional neural structures (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib45" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_45">Eiraku and Sasai 2012</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib140" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_140">Sasai et al 2012</a>). Epithelial populations are established in the embryo with the formation of the epiblast. Three main control pathways that maintain epithelial apicobasal polarity have been described (Crumbs, Baz/PAR-3, Scribble) and Wnt/planar cell polarity gene expression is involved with epithelial cell movement. When the neural tube is closing, its walls consist of a pseudostratified layer of columnar neural epithelial cells (see below). The cells increase in length and develop numerous longitudinally disposed microtubules; their apical surfaces are joined by tight junctions supported by claudins and linked to the actin cytoskeleton that forms a dense paraluminal web of microfilaments. The nuclei assume basal positions and this, together with the contraction of apically arranged actin, imparts a slight wedge conformation along the midline of the neural plate, creating a median hinge point that is termed the floor plate. The apical location of Wnt and the planar polarity genes maintain the apicobasal polarity and contribute to the convergent extension movements (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_21">Baumholtz et al 2017</a>). Movements of the cell populations on each side of the floor plate promote elevation of the layer and neural tube formation.</div><div class="text" id="p0060">The position of hinge points within the neural plate confers different luminal characteristics within the formed neural tube. With a median hinge point the neural folds remain relatively straight and the tube in this position has a slit-shaped lumen, as can be seen from the initial region of fusion rostralwards. If dorsolateral hinge points are added the resulting neural tube lumen becomes rhombic, and if all neuroepithelial cells exhibit some apical narrowing then the tube has a circular lumen. Rostrally, the slit-shaped profile depends more on support from adjacent tissues than at the caudal end of the tube where secondary neurulation produces a neural tube with a circular lumen.</div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0030">Secondary neurulation</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0065">Secondary neurulation is the process by which the caudal portion of the neural tube is formed in the absence of a neural plate. It starts from the closure of the caudal neuropore at stage 12 and ends at about stage 17. At the time of caudal neuropore closure the caudal midline cells are generically termed the caudal eminence (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib121" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">O’Rahilly and Müller 2004</a>). A specific population of mesenchymal cells, the caudoneural hinge or junction, shares the same molecular markers as the primitive node. These cells aggregate at the midline and undergo mesenchymal to epithelial transition, producing a cellular cylinder that is contiguous with the caudal end of the neural tube. Further elongation of the caudal neural tube involves cavitation of the neural cylinder. In a study of human embryos, the caudal end of the forming neural tube showed multiple outpouchings of the lumen at stage 18. The most caudal part was accompanied by a notochord. Immunohistochemical staining was negative for a range of neuronal antigens: N-CAM and NeuN labelling was seen after stage 16 and neurofilament-associated protein (3A10) labelled cells were seen from stages 16 and 18 in dorsal tissues. Apoptosis was noted in the very terminal end of the caudal eminence and the caudal portion of the neural tube showed regression at stage 19 (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib172" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_172">Yang et al 2014</a>). Neural crest cells delaminate from the dorsal surface of the cylinder in a rostrocaudal direction and the paraxial mesenchyme concurrently undergoes somitogenesis. The range of processes involved in secondary neurulation, the mechanisms of generation of caudal tissues, their further interactions within the developing cloacal region, and the formation of associated somatic and autonomic nerves, are all still as yet unknown. It may be that, as occurs in the head, where special populations of cells are required to form and provide neurological control of the oropharyngeal reflexes associated with the airway and proximal gut, a similar system occurs in the caudal region, where special cell populations provide tissues for the cloacal region and control the reflexes of the enteric, urinary and reproductive sphincters.</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0035">Failure of neurulation</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0070">Failure of neurulation produces the conditions of craniorachischisis totalis (where the entire neural tube is unfused in the dorsal midline), cranioschisis or anencephaly (where the neural tube is fused dorsally to form the spinal cord but is not fused dorsally in the brain), and spina bifida (where local regions of the spinal neural tube are unfused, or there is failure of formation of the vertebral neural arches) (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0165"><span class="bold">Fig. 14.3</span></a>; see <a href="../B9780702077050000185/B9780702077050000185.xhtml#f0075">Fig. 18.14</a>). Anencephalic fetuses display severe disturbances in the shape, position and ossification of the basichondrocranium and in the course of the intracranial notochord, and so the condition is more complicated than ‘simply’ a failure of neural tube fusion.

The first indication of a brain and its major divisions can be seen at stage 10 (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0015">Fig. 14.2</a>; <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 14.4</span></a>). Regional expansions, the prosencephalon (forebrain), mesencephalon (midbrain) and rhombencephalon (hindbrain), have been called the three primary cerebral vesicles, although the term ‘vesicle’ in this context is probably inappropriate to describe localized accelerations of growth in the wall of the brain. As the neural tube closes, the neural wall appears to form a series of ridges and depressions perpendicular to its long axis. These transient repeating segments are termed primary neuromeres. Initially, six can be identified, namely, the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and four subdivisions of the rhombencephalon, rhombomeres A, B, C and D. The primary neuromeres themselves become subdivided during stages 10, 11 and 12, and a total of 16 secondary neuromeres have been identified. The prosencephalon gives rise to the telencephalon, diencephalon 1 (D1) and diencephalon 2 (D2), which has three subdivisions. The mesencephalon is subdivided into the mesencephalon 1 (M1) and mesencephalon 2 (M2). The rhombencephalon is subdivided into the isthmus rhombencephali and rhombomeres 1–8; the original rhombomere A gives rise to secondary rhombomeres 1, 2 and 3; rhombomere B gives rise to secondary rhombomere 4; rhombomere C gives rise to secondary rhombomeres 5, 6 and 7; and rhombomere D gives rise to secondary rhombomere 8 (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib119" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_119">O’Rahilly and Müller 1999</a>). As the rhombencephalon grows, the rhombomeric boundaries become less distinct. With the early appearance of the cerebellum from the isthmus rhombencephali and rhombomere 1, the rhombencephalon is traditionally divided into the metencephalon, which extends to about rhombomere 3, and the myelencephalon, which extends to the spinomedullary junction. A summary of the derivatives of the cerebral regions is given in <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#t0010"><span class="bold">Table 14.1</span></a>.</div><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="235" id="pagebreak_235"/></div><section><a id="sf0020"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0020"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000148/main.assets/f14-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0020"/><a id="fspara0020"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 14.4</span> Formation of the mesencephalic, cervical and pontine flexures; human embryos, lateral views.

During stages 13 and 14 the brain bends at the mesencephalon (mesencephalic flexure) so that the prosencephalon bends in a ventral direction around the cephalic end of the notochord and foregut until its floor lies almost parallel with that of the rhombencephalon (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 14.4</a>). A bend (cervical flexure) also appears at the junction of the rhombencephalon and spinal cord, increasing in angulation over stages 14–20, by which time the rhombencephalon forms nearly a right-angle to the spinal cord. Extension of the head takes place after stage 20 and the cervical flexure diminishes and eventually disappears. The third bend, the pontine flexure, is directed ventrally between the metencephalon and myelencephalon and does not substantially affect the outline of the head. In this region, the roof plate thins until it is composed only of a single layer of cells and pia mater, the tela choroidea. The flexure of the neural tube at this point produces a rhombic shape in the roof that later forms the medullary velum.</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0045">Neural Crest</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0085">The neuronal populations of the early epiblast become arranged in the medial region of the embryonic disc as the neural plate (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0030">Fig 10.5</a>). Laterally, neural folds or crests indicate a transitional region between the neural and surface ectoderm. Cells in the crests undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition and leave the epithelium just prior to its fusion with the contralateral fold in the rhombencephalic dorsal midline: their new mesenchymal phenotype means that they acquire migratory properties. Two distinct populations of neural crest cells are formed: a neuronal population produced throughout the brain and spinal cord that gives rise to sensory and autonomic neurones and associated glia, and a non-neuronal mesenchymal population that arises only from the brain (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0025"><span class="bold">Figs 14.5</span></a>-<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0170"><span class="bold">14.6</span></a>).

Neural crest cells arising from the diencephalon up to the level of the future pineal gland (epiphysis) contribute mesenchymal populations to the frontonasal process. From stage 10 a number of transverse subdivisions perpendicular to the long axis of the brain can be seen within the rhombencephalon, dividing it into segments termed rhombomeres (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib110" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_110">Müller and O’Rahilly 1997</a>).

Rhombomeres 1 and 2 produce neural crest cells that invade the first pharyngeal arch; rhombomere 4 crest cells migrate into pharyngeal arch 2; rhombomere 6 crest cells migrate into pharyngeal arch 3; rhombomeres 7 and 8 derived neural crest cells migrate into pharyngeal arches 4 and 6. Rhombomeres 3 and 5 give rise to only a very small number of neural crest cells that migrate rostrally and caudally to enter the adjacent even-numbered rhombomeres. These rostral origins give rise to cranial and vagal neural crest. Vagal neural crest migration is extensive: the cells pass ventrally into the developing heart and appear to have a particular association with organs that arise from endoderm, e.g. the thymus gland, foregut-derived respiratory tubes and the gut, where they give rise to the enteric nervous system (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib74" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_74">Hutchins et al 2018</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0095">Trunk neural crest cells are patterned by their migration through the somites.

The larger population, of neural crest cells, migrates from the neural epithelium prior to neural tube fusion. The smaller population, of neuroepithelial cells, becomes incorporated into the surface ectoderm after neural tube closure. These areas of neuroepithelium within the surface ectoderm have been termed ectodermal placodes. Although the majority of the ectodermal placodes form nervous tissue, non-neurogenic placodes also occur (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Begbie and Graham 2001</a>). After an appropriate inductive stimulus, the placodes thicken and they either generate migratory neuronal cells that will contribute to the cranial sensory ganglia, or the whole placodal region invaginates to form a vesicle beneath the remaining surface ectoderm. Neurogenic placodes undergo both processes. Paired non-neurogenic placodes invaginate to form the lens vesicles under the inductive influence of the optic vesicles (<a href="../B978070207705000015X/B978070207705000015X.xhtml">Ch. 15</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0110">The neural folds meet in the rostral midline adjacent to the buccopharyngeal membrane.

During G2, the nuclei migrate apically (toward the neural tube lumen) where cell division occurs. The basal body of the primary cilium is anchored to the apical surface: the cilium persists through the cell cycle until the onset of mitosis when the basal body and associated second centriole form the centrosomes of the mitotic spindle (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib146" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_146">Taverna and Huttner 2010</a>).

Cells from both layers continue to multiply to provide generations of neurones and glia that subsequently migrate into the intermediate and marginal zones. Those in the subventricular zone are termed intermediate neural progenitor cells or basal progenitors to emphasize the fact that they are no longer attached to the apical (ventricular) surface. They translocate their nuclei to an abventricular location for mitosis. Radially migrating cells from the ventricular zone in the developing cerebral hemispheres form a zone, the cortical plate, outside the intermediate zone.

Although these segmental units lose their morphological prominence with subsequent development, they represent the fundamental ground plan of the neuraxis, creating a series of semi-autonomous units, within which local variations in patterning can then develop.

Both neural crest cell migration and motor axon outgrowth occur through only the rostral and not the caudal sclerotome of each somite, so that dorsal root ganglia form only at intervals.

This specialized region consists of a strip of non-neural cells with distinctive adhesive and functional properties. Notochord and floor plate together participate in inducing the differentiation of the motor columns.

Neural crest cells are produced continuously along the length of the spinal cord, but gangliogenic cells migrate only into the rostral part of each somitic sclerotome, where they condense and proliferate to form a bilateral series of oval primordial spinal ganglia (dorsal root ganglia) (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0170">Fig. 14.6</a>; <a href="../B9780702077050000185/B9780702077050000185.xhtml">Ch. 18</a>). Negative factors in the caudal sclerotome deter neural crest cells from entering. The rostral sclerotome has a mitogenic effect on the crest cells that settle within it. From the ventral region of each ganglion, a small part separates to form sympathochromaffin cells, while the remainder becomes a definitive spinal ganglion (dorsal root ganglion). The spinal ganglia are arranged symmetrically at the sides of the neural tube and, except in the caudal region, are equal in number to the somites. The cells of the ganglia, like the cells of the intermediate zone of the early neural tube, are glial and neuronal precursors. The glial precursors develop into satellite cells (which become closely applied to the ganglionic nerve cell somata), Schwann cells and, possibly, other cells. The neuroblasts, at first round or oval, soon become fusiform, and their extremities gradually elongate into central and peripheral processes. The central processes grow into the neural tube as the fibres of the dorsal nerve roots, while the peripheral processes grow ventrolaterally to mingle with the fibres of the ventral root, thus forming a mixed spinal nerve. As development proceeds, the original bipolar form of the cells in the spinal ganglia changes: <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="242" id="pagebreak_242"/>the two processes become closer and ultimately fuse to form a single stem, producing the characteristic morphology of a unipolar neurone.

General somatic efferent neurones exit ventrally in a similar manner to those of the spinal cord. Thus, the oculomotor, trochlear, abducens and hypoglossal nerves parallel the organization of the somatic motor neurones in the spinal cord. The second motor component, special branchial efferent, consists of the motor components of the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves that supply the pharyngeal (branchial) arches, and the (spinal) accessory nerve. These nerves all have nerve exit points more dorsally placed than the somatic motor system.</div><div class="text" id="p0330">The cranial nerves also contain general visceral efferent (parasympathetic preganglionic) neurones that travel in the oculomotor, facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves and leave the hindbrain via the same exit points as the special branchial efferent fibres. All three categories of motor neurones probably originate from the same region of the basal plate, adjacent to the floor plate. The definitive arrangement of nuclei reflects the differential migration of neuronal somata. It is not known whether all these cell types share a common precursor within the rhombencephalon.

All the voluntary muscles of the head originate from axial (prechordal) or paraxial mesenchyme, rendering the distinction between somatic efferent supply and branchial efferent supply somewhat artificial. However, the obviously special nature of the arch musculature, its patterning by the neural crest cells, its particularly rich innervation for both voluntary and reflex activity, and the different origins from the basal plate of the branchial efferent nerves compared to the somatic efferent nerves, make the retention of a distinction between the two of some value.</div><div class="text" id="p0340">The cranial sensory ganglia are derived in part from the neural crest and in part from cells of the ectodermal placodes (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0080">Figs 14.8</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0035">14.18</a>).

Supporting cells of all sensory ganglia arise from the neural crest. The most rostral sensory ganglion, the trigeminal, contains both neural crest- and placode-derived neurones that mediate general somatic afferent functions. This is also the case for more caudal cranial nerves (the facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus), but the two cell populations form separate ganglia in the case of each nerve. The proximal series of ganglia is neural crest-derived (forming the proximal root of the facial nerve, the superior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve, the jugular ganglion of the vagus nerve, and associated glial precursors) while the distal series is derived from placodal cells (forming the neurones of the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve, the petrosal ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve and the nodose ganglion of the vagus nerve). These ganglia contain neurones that mediate special and general visceral afferent and somatic afferent functions. The vestibular ganglion contains both crest and placodal cells, and the cochlear ganglion contains only placodal neurones; the axons from these cells are special somatic afferents and they all travel in the vestibulocochlear nerve.</div><div class="text" id="p0345">The neurones and supporting cells of the cranial autonomic ganglia in the head and the trunk originate from neural crest cells. Caudal to the vagal ganglion, the occipital region of the neural crest is concerned with the ‘ganglia’ of the accessory and hypoglossal nerves. Rudimentary ganglion cells may occur along the hypoglossal nerve in the human embryo but they subsequently regress. Ganglion cells are found on the developing intraspinal root of the accessory nerve and are believed to persist in the adult. The central processes of the cells of these various ganglia, where they persist, enter the alar lamina of the hindbrain. Their peripheral processes join the efferent components of the nerve to be distributed to the various tissues innervated. Some incoming fibres from the facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves collect to form an oval bundle, the tractus solitarius, on the lateral aspect of the myelencephalon. This bundle is the homologue of the oval bundle (of His) of the spinal cord, but in the hindbrain it becomes more deeply placed by the overgrowth, folding and subsequent fusion of tissue derived from the rhombic lip on the external aspect of the bundle.

The local environment plays a major role in controlling the appropriate differentiation of the presumptive autonomic ganglion neurones: the factors responsible for subsequent development of an adrenergic, cholinergic or peptidergic phenotype have not been identified.

They are found at numerous sites throughout the body, namely the classic chromaffin cells of the suprarenal medulla, bronchial neuroepithelial cells, dispersed epithelial endocrine cells of the gut (formerly known as argentaffin cells), carotid body cells and the paraganglia. The sympathetic ganglia, suprarenal medulla and chromaffin cells are all derived from the cells of the sympathosuprarenal lineage. In the suprarenal medulla, first seen in stage 14, these cells differentiate into small and intermediate-sized neuroblasts or sympathoblasts, and larger, initially rounded phaeochromocytoblasts. Large cells with pale nuclei, thought to be the progenitors of chromaffin cells, can be detected after stage 23, and clusters of small neurones are evident from postmenstrual week 14.</div><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="244" id="pagebreak_244"/></div><div class="text" id="p0395">Intermediate-sized neuroblasts differentiate into multipolar postganglionic sympathetic neurones that secrete noradrenaline (norepinephrine) at their terminals. The smaller neuroblasts probably correlate with the small, intensely fluorescent (SIF) cells, types I and II, that store and secrete dopamine type I and are thought to function as true interneurones, synapsing with the principal postganglionic neurones. Type II cells probably operate as local neuroendocrine cells, secreting dopamine into the ganglionic microcirculation. Both types of SIF cells can modulate synaptic transmission in the ganglionic neurones. The large cells differentiate into masses of columnar or polyhedral phaeochromocytes (classic chromaffin cells) that secrete either adrenaline (epinephrine) or noradrenaline. These cell masses are termed paraganglia and may be situated near, on the surface of, or embedded in, the capsules of the ganglia of the sympathetic chain, or in some of the large autonomic plexuses. The largest members of the latter are the para-aortic bodies that lie along the sides of the abdominal aorta in relation to the inferior mesenteric artery. During childhood, the para-aortic bodies and the paraganglia of the sympathetic trunk partly degenerate and can no longer be isolated by gross dissection; even in the adult, chromaffin tissue can still be recognized microscopically in these various sites. Both phaeochromocytes and SIF cells belong to the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) series of cells and are paraneuronal in nature.

Histologically, ganglia and postganglionic neurones in the myenteric plexus of the affected segment of gut are either absent or reduced in number and postganglionic innervation of the muscle layers is also often defective. The condition is characterized by a dilated segment of colon proximally (or small bowel in cases of total colonic Hirschsprung’s disease) and a lack of peristalsis in the segment distal to the dilation.

Their disposition may be determined in part by contact guidance along the earliest radial array of glial fibres that cross the full thickness of the early neuroepithelium. The cells of the intermediate zone are more loosely packed. They increase in number initially in the region of the basal plate. This enlargement outlines the anterior (ventral) column of the grey matter and causes a ventral projection on each side of the median plane; the floor plate remains at the bottom of the shallow groove so produced. As growth proceeds, these enlargements are further increased by the development of the anterior funiculi (tracts of axons passing to and from the brain) and encroach on the groove until it becomes converted into the slit-like anterior median fissure of the adult spinal cord. The axons of some of the neuroblasts in the anterior grey column cross the marginal zone and emerge as bundles of ventral spinal nerve rootlets on the anterolateral aspect of the spinal cord. These will eventually constitute both the α-efferents that establish motor end-plates on extrafusal striated muscle fibres and the γ-efferents that innervate the contractile polar regions of the intrafusal muscle fibres of the muscle spindles.

From the second trimester, the vertebral column grows more rapidly than the spinal cord, which means that the relationship between the conus medullaris and the vertebral column changes as the conus gradually ascends to lie at higher vertebral levels (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_19">Barson 1970</a>). Most of this relative rostral migration occurs during the first half of intrauterine life. By postmenstrual week 25 the terminal ventricle of the spinal cord has altered in level from the second coccygeal vertebra to the third lumbar, a distance of nine segments (<a href="../B9780702077050000185/B9780702077050000185.xhtml">Ch. 18</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000185/B9780702077050000185.xhtml#pg300">p. 300</a>). As the change in level begins rostrally, the caudal end of the terminal ventricle, which is adherent to the overlying ectoderm, remains <span class="italic">in situ</span>, and the walls of the intermediate part of the ventricle and its covering pia mater become drawn out to form a delicate filament, the filum terminale. The separated portion of the terminal ventricle persists for a time; it usually disappears before birth, although it does occasionally give rise to congenital cysts near the coccyx. In the definitive state, the upper cervical spinal nerves retain their position roughly at right-angles to the cord: proceeding caudally, the nerve roots lengthen and become progressively more oblique. By postmenstrual week 40 the conus medullaris typically lies between the first and third lumbar vertebrae.</div><div class="text" id="p0490">Determining the prenatal position of the conus medullaris relative to specific vertebrae is a widely used method of identifying the termination of the spinal cord. Studies of formalin-fixed fetuses, usually of preterm stillbirths that may be small for dates, have provided the main timescales. More recently, values have been derived from antenatal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. The often wide discrepancies between published values attest to the fact that ageing preterm infants remains an inexact science. Measurements may be influenced by factors such as placental health, maternal diet, ethnic biometrical variation, fetal sex and the interpretation and correlation of results obtained using differing methodologies (cadaveric dissection, ultrasound, MRI).</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0165"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0170">Brain</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0495">A summary of the derivatives of the cerebral regions from caudal to rostral is given in <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#t0010">Table 14.1</a>.</div><section><a id="s0170"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0175">Rhombencephalon</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0500">By the time the midbrain flexure appears, the length of the rhombencephalon is greater than that of the combined extent of the mesencephalon and prosencephalon. Rostrally, it exhibits a constriction, the isthmus rhombencephali (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 14.4A</a>), best viewed from the dorsal aspect. Ventrally, the hindbrain is separated from the dorsal wall of the primitive pharynx only by the notochord, the two dorsal aortae and a small amount of mesenchyme; on each side, it is closely related to the dorsal ends of the pharyngeal arches.</div><div class="text" id="p0505">The pontine flexure appears to ‘stretch’ the thin, epithelial roof plate, which becomes widened. The greatest increase in width corresponds to the region of maximum convexity, so that the outline of the roof plate becomes rhomboidal. By the same change, the lateral walls become separated, particularly dorsally, and the cavity of the hindbrain, (presumptive fourth ventricle), becomes flattened and somewhat triangular in cross-section. The pontine flexure becomes increasingly acute until, at the end of the first trimester, the laminae of its cranial (metencephalic) and caudal (myelencephalic) slopes are opposed to each other (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0100">Fig. 14.22</a>); at the same time, the lateral angles of the cavity extend to form the lateral recesses of the fourth ventricle.</div><div class="text" id="p0510">At about stage 14 when the pontine flexure is first discernible, the association between the rhombomeres and the underlying motor nuclei of certain cranial nerves can be seen. The general pattern of distribution of motor nuclei is as follows: rhombomere 1 contains the trochlear nucleus, rhombomeres 2 and 3 contain the trigeminal nucleus, rhombomeres 4 and 5 contain the facial nucleus, rhombomere 5 contains the abducens nucleus, rhombomeres 6 and 7 contain the glossopharyngeal nucleus, and rhombomeres 7 and 8 contain the vagal, accessory and hypoglossal nuclei. Rhombomeric segmentation represents the ground plan of development in this region of the brainstem and is pivotal for the development of regional identity (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0015">Figs 14.2</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000124/B9780702077050000124.xhtml#f0025">12.4</a>). With further morphogenesis, the obvious constrictions of the rhombomere boundaries disappear and the medulla once again assumes a smooth contour. The differentiation of the lateral walls of the hindbrain into basal (ventrolateral) and alar (dorsolateral) plates has a similar significance to the corresponding differentiation in the lateral wall of the spinal cord: ventricular, intermediate and marginal zones are formed in the same way.</div><section><a id="s0175"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0180">Cell columns of the basal plate (ventrolateral lamina)</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0515">Cells of the basal plate form three elongated, discontinuous, columns: ventral, intermediate and dorsal (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0095"><span class="bold">Fig. 14.21</span></a>). The most ventral column is continuous with the anterior grey column of the spinal cord and will supply muscles considered ‘myotomic’ in origin. It is represented in the caudal part of the hindbrain by the hypoglossal nucleus, and it reappears at a higher level as the nuclei of the abducens, trochlear and oculomotor nerves (somatic efferent nuclei). The intermediate column is represented in the upper part of the spinal cord and caudal brainstem (medulla oblongata and pons), and its neurones supply branchial (pharyngeal) and postbranchial musculature. It is discontinuous, forming the elongated nucleus ambiguus in the caudal brainstem, which gives fibres to the glossopharyngeal, vagal and (cranial) accessory nerves, and continues into the cervical spinal cord as the origin of the (spinal) accessory nerve. At higher levels, parts of this column give origin to the motor nuclei of the facial and trigeminal nerves. The nucleus ambiguus and the facial and trigeminal motor nuclei are termed branchial (special visceral) efferent nuclei. Neurones in the most dorsal column of the basal plate (represented in the spinal cord by the lateral grey column) innervate viscera. This column is discontinuous in that its large caudal part forms some of the dorsal nucleus of the vagus and its cranial part forms the salivatory nucleus. These nuclei are termed general visceral (general splanchnic) efferent nuclei, and their neurones give rise to preganglionic, parasympathetic nerve fibres. The neurones of the basal plate and their three columnar derivatives are only motor in the sense that some of their number form either motor neurones or preganglionic <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="247" id="pagebreak_247"/><a id="pg247"/>parasympathetic neurones.

The general visceral afferent column is represented by a part of the dorsal nucleus of the vagus, the special visceral afferent column by the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, the general somatic afferent column by the afferent nuclei of the trigeminal nerve, and the special somatic afferent column by the nuclei of the vestibulocochlear nerve. (The relatively simple functional independence of these afferent columns implied by the foregoing classification is, in the main, an aid to elementary learning. The emergent neurobiological mechanisms are much more complex and less well understood.) Although they tend to retain their primitive positions, some of these nuclei are later displaced by differential growth patterns, by the appearance and growth of neighbouring fibre tracts, and possibly by active migration.</div><div class="text" id="p0525">It has been suggested that a neurone tends to remain as near as possible to its predominant source of stimulation, and that, to achieve this aim, it will migrate around intervening structures, towards the greatest density of stimuli. The curious paths of the axons arising from the facial nucleus and the nucleus ambiguus have been regarded as exemplars of this phenomenon of so called neurobiotaxis. At stage 16 the facial nucleus lies in the floor of the fourth ventricle, occupying the position of the special visceral efferent column, and it is placed at a higher level than the abducens nucleus. As growth proceeds, the facial nucleus migrates at first caudally and dorsally, relative to the abducens nucleus, and then ventrally to reach its adult position. As it migrates, the axons to which its somata give rise elongate and their subsequent course is assumed to map out the pathway along which the facial nucleus has travelled. Similarly, the nucleus ambiguus initially arises immediately deep to the ventricular floor but, in the adult, it is more deeply placed and its efferent fibres pass first dorsally and medially before curving laterally to emerge at the surface of the medulla oblongata.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0185"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0190">Myelencephalon</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0530">The caudal slope of the embryonic hindbrain constitutes the myelencephalon, which develops into the medulla oblongata (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0085">Figs 14.4</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0100">14.19</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0020">14.22</a>). The nuclei of the glossopharyngeal, vagal, accessory and hypoglossal cranial nerves develop in the positions already indicated: afferent fibres from the ganglia of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves form an oval marginal bundle in the region overlying the alar (dorsolateral) lamina. Throughout the rhombencephalon, the dorsal edge of this lamina is attached to the thin, expanded roof plate and is termed the rhombic lip. (The inferior rhombic lip is confined to the myelencephalon, the superior rhombic lip to the metencephalon.) As the walls of the rhombencephalon spread outwards, the rhombic lip protrudes as a lateral edge that becomes folded over the adjoining area. The rhombic lip may later become adherent to this area, and its cells migrate actively into the marginal zone of the basal plate. In this way, the oval bundle that forms the tractus solitarius becomes buried. Alar plate cells that migrate from the rhombic lip are believed to give rise to the olivary and arcuate nuclei and to the scattered grey matter of the nuclei pontis. While this migration is in progress, the floor plate is invaded by fibres that cross the median plane (accompanied by neurones that cluster in and near this plane), and it becomes thickened to form the median raphe. Some of the migrating cells from the rhombic lip in this region do not reach the basal plate and form an oblique ridge, the corpus pontobulbare (nucleus of the circumolivary bundle), across the dorsolateral aspect of the inferior cerebellar peduncle.</div><div class="text" id="p0535">The lower part (caudal half) of the myelencephalon takes no part in the formation of the fourth ventricle and closely resembles the spinal cord in its development.

Contemporaneously, the inferior cerebellar peduncle is formed dorsally by ascending fibres from the spinal cord, and by olivocerebellar, parolivocerebellar and external arcuate fibres, and two-way reticulocerebellar and vestibulocerebellar interconnections. (The reticular nuclei of the lower medulla probably have a dual origin from both basal and alar plates.) In a full-term neonate, the brainstem is more oblique and has a distinct bend as it passes through the foramen magnum to become the spinal cord.</div></section><section><a id="s0190"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0195">Metencephalon</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0545">The rostral slope of the embryonic hindbrain is the metencephalon, from which both the cerebellum and the pons develop. Before formation of the pontine flexure, the dorsolateral laminae of the metencephalon are parallel with one another. After its formation, the roof plate of the hindbrain becomes rhomboidal and the dorsal laminae of the metencephalon lie obliquely. They are close at the cranial end of the fourth ventricle, but widely separated at the level of its lateral angles (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0085">Figs 14.19</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0100">14.22</a>).

Ventricular, intermediate and marginal zones are formed in the usual way, and the nuclei of the trigeminal, abducens and facial nerves develop in the intermediate layer. It is possible that the grey matter of the reticular formation is derived from the basal plate and that of the nuclei pontis from the alar plate by the active migration of cells from the rhombic lip. At about postmenstrual weeks 15–16 the pons is invaded by corticopontine, corticonuclear and corticospinal fibres, becomes proportionately thicker, and takes on its adult appearance; it is relatively smaller in the full-term neonate.</div><div class="text" id="p0555">The region of the isthmus rhombencephali undergoes a series of changes that are notoriously difficult to interpret. They result in the incorporation of the greater part of the region into the caudal end of the midbrain. Only the roof plate, in which the superior medullary velum is formed, and the dorsal part of the alar plate, which becomes invaded by converging fibres of the superior cerebellar peduncles, remain as recognizable derivatives in the adult. Early in development, the decussation of the trochlear nerves is caudal to the isthmus, but it is gradually displaced rostrally until it reaches its adult position.</div><section><a id="s2195"/><section><a id="s0195"/><h5 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0200">Fourth ventricle and choroid plexus</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0560">Caudal to the developing cerebellum, the roof of the fourth ventricle remains epithelial, and covers an approximately triangular zone from the lateral angles of the rhomboid fossa to the median obex (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0085">Figs 14.19</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0100">14.22</a>). Nervous tissue fails to develop over this region and vascular pia mater is closely applied to the subjacent ependyma. At each lateral angle and in the midline caudally, the membranes break through, forming the lateral (Luschka) and median (Magendie) apertures of the roof of the fourth ventricle: they become the principal routes by which cerebrospinal fluid, produced in the ventricles, escapes into the subarachnoid space. The vascular pia mater (tela choroidea), in an inverted V formation cranial to the apertures, invaginates the ependyma to form vascular fringes that become the vertical and horizontal parts of the choroid plexuses of the fourth ventricle.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0200"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0205">Cerebellum</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0565">The cerebellum develops from the rhombic lip (dorsal rhombomere 1 (r1)), the dorsal part of the alar plate of the metencephalon, which constitutes the rostral margin of the diamond-shaped fourth ventricle.

The most rostral part of the roof of the metencephalon originally separates the two swellings, but it becomes invaded by cells derived from the alar plate, which form the rudiments of the vermis. At a later stage, extroversion of the cerebellum occurs, its intraventricular projection is reduced and the dorsal extraventricular prominence increases. The cerebellum now consists of a bilobar (dumbbell-shaped) swelling stretched across the rostral part of the fourth ventricle (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0100"><span class="bold">Fig. 14.22</span></a>).

The right and left parts of this fissure subsequently meet in the midline, where they form the boundary between the most caudal vermian lobule, the nodule, and the rest of the vermis. The flocculonodular lobe can now be recognized as the most caudal cerebellar subdivision at this stage and it serves as the attachment of the epithelial roof of the fourth ventricle. Because of the expansion of the other divisions of the cerebellum, the flocculonodular <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="248" id="pagebreak_248"/><a id="pg248"/>lobe comes to occupy an anteroinferior position in adults. At the end of the first trimester, a transverse sulcus appears on the rostral slope of the cerebellar rudiment and deepens to form the fissura prima that cuts into the vermis and both hemispheres, and forms the border between the anterior and posterior lobes. Contemporaneously, two short transverse grooves appear in the caudal vermis. The first is the fissura secunda (postpyramidal fissure), which forms the rostral border of the uvula and the second is the pre-pyramidal fissure, which demarcates the pyramid. The cerebellum now grows dorsally, rostrally, caudally and laterally, and the hemispheres expand much more than the inferior vermis, which therefore becomes buried at the bottom of a deep hollow, the vallecula. Numerous other transverse grooves develop, the most extensive being the horizontal fissure.</div></section><section><a id="s0205"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0210">Cellular development of the cerebellum</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0575">The cerebellum consists of a cortex, beneath which are buried a series of deep nuclei. The organization of the cerebellar cortex is similar to that of the cerebral cortex, except that the latter typically has six layers while the former has only three. However, whereas in the cerebral cortex neuroblasts originate from the ventricular zone and migrate ventriculofugally towards the pial surface (in an ‘inside-out’ fashion), early in cerebellar development a layer of cells derived exclusively from the metencephalic rhombic lip initially migrates ventriculofugally to form a layer beneath the glia limitans over the surface of the developing cerebellum. These cells form the external germinative layer; later in development their progeny will migrate ventriculopetally (in an ‘outside-in’ manner), into the cerebellum. The cerebellum therefore has an intraventricular portion (cells proliferating from the ventricular zone) and an extraventricular portion (cells proliferating from the external germinative layer) during development. The extraventricular portion becomes larger at the expense of the intraventricular portion, the so-called extroversion of the cerebellum. Before the end of the first trimester, the main mass of the cerebellum is extraventricular.</div><div class="text" id="p0580">The developed cerebellar cortex contains three layers, namely the molecular, Purkinje and granular layers. The early bilateral expansion of the ventricular surface reflects the production, by the metencephalic alar plate ventricular epithelium, of neuroblasts that will give rise to the radial glia, cerebellar nuclei and efferent neurones of the cerebellar cortex (the Purkinje cells) (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0110"><span class="bold">Fig. 14.24</span></a>). The radial glia play a role in guiding the Purkinje cells to the meningeal surface of the cerebellar anlage. During this early stage of cerebellar development, which is dominated by the production and migration of efferent cerebellar neurones, the surface of the cerebellar anlage remains smooth. The extroversion of the cerebellum begins later when cells of the external germinative layer, also termed the superficial matrix, begin proliferation and migration. These cells produce the granule cells which migrate inwards along the radial glia, through the layers of Purkinje cells, settling deep to them in the granular layer. This stage coincides with the emergences of the transverse folial pattern. Proliferation and migration of granule cells lead to a great rostrocaudal expansion of the meningeal surface of the cerebellum, forming the transverse fissures and transforming the multicellular layer of Purkinje cells into a monolayer. The development of the efferent neurones of the cerebellar cortex and nuclei precedes the development of its afferent organization: Purkinje cells and nuclear cells are formed prior to the granule cells, which are the recipients of the main afferent (mossy fibre) system of the cerebellum.</div><section><a id="sf0110"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0110"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000148/main.assets/f14-22-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0110"/><a id="fspara0110"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 14.24</span> Histogenesis of the cerebellar cortex and the cerebellar nuclei. <span class="bold">A</span>, Purkinje cells and cells of the cerebellar nuclei are produced by the ventricular zone and migrate to their future positions.

Later, its cavity becomes relatively reduced in diameter and, in the adult brain, it forms the cerebral aqueduct. The basal (ventrolateral) plate of the midbrain increases in thickness to form the cerebral peduncles, which are at first of small size but enlarge rapidly in the early second trimester, when their numerous fibre tracts begin to appear in the marginal zone. The neuroblasts of the basal plate of mesencephalon 2 give rise to the nuclei of the oculomotor nerve and some grey masses of the tegmentum, while the nucleus of the trochlear nerve remains in the region of the isthmus rhombencephali. The cells that give rise to the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus arise either side of the dorsal midline, from the isthmus rhombencephali rostrally across the roof of the mesencephalon.

Each lateral wall is divided into a dorsal area and a ventral area separated internally by the hypothalamic sulcus (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0115">Fig. 14.26</a>). This sulcus ends rostrally at the medial end of the optic stalk. In the fully developed brain, it persists as a slight groove extending from the interventricular foramen to the cerebral aqueduct. It is analogous to, if not the homologue of, the sulcus limitans. The thin roof plate remains epithelial but invaginated by vascular mesenchyme, the tela choroidea of the choroid plexuses of the third ventricle. Later, the lateral margins of the tela undergo a similar invagination into the medial walls of the cerebral hemispheres. The floor plate thickens as the nuclear masses of the hypothalamus and subthalamus develop.</div><div class="text" id="p0625">At a very early period, before the closure of the rostral neuropore, the subdivision of the prosencephalon into the most rostral telencephalon and two subdivisions of the diencephalon, D1 and D2, is heralded (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0015">Fig. 14.2</a>). At this early time, two eye fields are separated by the future neurohypophysis in the floor of the future D1. After head folding, the eye fields expand as two lateral optic evaginations, that will become optic vesicles, one on each side of the early brain. For a time, they communicate with the cavity of the prosencephalon by relatively wide openings. The distal parts of the optic vesicles expand, while the proximal parts become <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="250" id="pagebreak_250"/><a id="pg250"/>the tubular optic stalks. The optic vesicles (described with the development of the eye in <a href="../B978070207705000015X/B978070207705000015X.xhtml">Ch. 15</a>) are thus derived from the lateral walls of the D1 subdivision of the prosencephalon before the telencephalon can be clearly identified. The optic chiasma is often regarded as the boundary between the diencephalon and telencephalon.</div><div class="text" id="p0630">As the most rostral portion of the prosencephalon enlarges, it curves ventrally, and two further diverticula expand rapidly from it, one on each side. These diverticula, rostrolateral to the optic stalks, subsequently form the cerebral hemispheres. Their cavities are the rudiments of the lateral ventricles and they communicate with the median part of the forebrain cavity by relatively wide openings that ultimately become the interventricular foramina. The rostral limit of the median part of the forebrain consists of a thin sheet, the lamina terminalis (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0115">Fig. 14.26</a>), which stretches from the interventricular foramina to the recess at the base of the optic stalks. The rostral part of the forebrain, including the rudiments of the cerebral hemispheres, consists of the telencephalon and the caudal part of the diencephalon; both contribute to the formation of the third ventricle, although the latter predominates.

The dorsal part develops into the (dorsal) thalamus and metathalamus along the immediate suprasulcal area of its lateral wall, while the highest dorsocaudal lateral wall and roof form the epithalamus. The thalamus is first visible as a thickening that involves the rostral part of the dorsal area (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0115">Fig. 14.26</a>). Caudal to the thalamus, the lateral and medial geniculate bodies, or metathalamus, are recognizable at first as surface depressions on the internal aspect and as elevations on the external aspect of the lateral wall. As the thalami enlarge as smooth ovoid masses, the wide interval between them gradually narrows into a vertically compressed cavity that forms the greater part of the third ventricle. After a time these medial surfaces may come into contact and become adherent over a variable area, the connection (single or multiple) constituting the interthalamic adhesion or massa intermedia. The caudal growth of the thalamus excludes the geniculate bodies from the lateral wall of the third ventricle.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="251" id="pagebreak_251"/><a id="pg251"/></div><div class="text" id="p0640">At first the lateral aspect of the developing thalamus is separated from the medial aspect of the cerebral hemisphere by a cleft that becomes obliterated as the thalamus fuses with the part of the hemisphere in which the corpus striatum is developing (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0120"><span class="bold">Fig. 14.27</span></a>). The subsequent development of the corticofugal and corticopetal projection fibres of the neocortex means that the thalamus becomes related to the internal capsule, which intervenes between it and the lateral part of the corpus striatum (lentiform nucleus).

Between stages 17–20 the epithalamus in the lateral wall projects into the third ventricle as a smooth ellipsoid mass, larger than the adjacent mass of the (dorsal) thalamus and separated from it by a well-defined epithalamic sulcus. Subsequent growth of the thalamus rapidly overtakes that of the epithalamus and the intervening sulcus is obliterated: structures of epithalamic origin become relatively diminutive topographically.</div><div class="text" id="p0650">The pineal gland arises as a hollow outgrowth from the roof plate, immediately adjoining the mesencephalon. Its distal part becomes solid by cellular proliferation but its proximal stalk remains hollow and contains the pineal recess of the third ventricle. In many reptiles the pineal outgrowth consists of a rostral outgrowth (parapineal organ) that develops into the pineal or parietal eye, and a glandular caudal outgrowth that is homologous with the human pineal gland. The rostral outgrowth also develops in the human embryo but soon disappears entirely.</div><div class="text" id="p0655">The nucleus habenulae, the most important constituent of the trigonum habenulae, develops in the lateral wall of the diencephalon. It is initially a close relation of the geniculate bodies, from which it is later separated by the dorsal growth of the thalamus. The habenular commissure develops in the cranial wall of the pineal recess. The posterior commissure is formed by fibres that invade the caudal wall of the pineal recess from both sides.</div><div class="text" id="p0660">The ventral part of the diencephalon forms the subsulcal lateral walls of the third ventricle and takes part in the formation of the hypothalamus, including the mammillary bodies, the tuber cinereum and infundibulum of the hypophysis. The mammillary bodies arise as a single thickening that becomes divided by a median furrow during the end of the first trimester. The tuber cinereum develops rostral to the mammillary bodies as a cellular proliferation that extends forwards as far as the infundibulum. A wide-mouthed diverticulum forms in the floor of the diencephalon in front of the tuber cinereum and grows towards the stomodeal roof, coming into contact with the posterior aspect of a dorsally directed ingrowth from the stomodeum (Rathke’s pouch). These two diverticula together form the hypophysis cerebri (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0045">Fig. 14.10</a>). An extension of the third ventricle persists in the base of the neural outgrowth as the infundibular recess. The remaining caudolateral walls and floor of the ventral diencephalon are an extension of the midbrain tegmentum, the subthalamus. This forms the rostral limits of the red nucleus, the substantia nigra, numerous reticular nuclei and a mass of interweaving, ascending, descending and oblique nerve fibre bundles.</div><section><a id="s7225"/><section><a id="s0225"/><h5 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0230">Third ventricle and choroid plexus</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0665">The roof plate of the diencephalon rostral to the pineal gland continues over the median telencephalon, remaining thin and epithelial in character and is invaginated by the choroid plexuses of the third ventricle (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0120">Fig. 14.27</a>; <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0125"><span class="bold">Fig. 14.28</span></a>). Before the development of the corpus callosum and the fornix, it lies at the bottom of the longitudinal fissure between and reaching the two cerebral hemispheres. It extends as far rostrally as the interventricular foramina and lamina terminalis. Here, and elsewhere, choroid plexuses develop by the close apposition of vascular pia mater and ependyma without intervening nervous tissue. With development, the vascular layer is infolded into the ventricular cavity and develops a series of small villous projections, each covered by a cuboidal epithelium derived from the ependyma. The cuboidal cells display numerous microvilli on their ventricular surfaces and complex folding of their basal plasma membranes. The early choroid plexuses secrete a protein-rich cerebrospinal fluid into the ventricular system, which may provide a nutritive medium for the developing epithelial neural tissues. As the latter become increasingly vascularized, the histochemical reactions of the cuboidal cells and the character of the fluid change to the adult type. Many regions of the lining of the third ventricle become highly specialized, and develop concentrations of tanycytes or other modified cells that are collectively termed the circumventricular organs, e.g. the subfornical organ, the organum vasculosum (intercolumnar tubercle) of the lamina terminalis, the subcommissural organ, and the linings of the pineal, suprapineal and infundibular recesses.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0125"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000148/main.assets/f14-25-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0125"/><a id="fspara0125"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 14.28</span> Coronal section of the left cerebral hemisphere at postmenstrual week 13. <br/><span class="figcredit">Redrawn with permission from Hamilton WJ, Boyd JD, Mossman HW 1972 Human Embryology: Prenatal Development of Form and Function.

The lateral diverticula are outpouchings of the lateral walls of the telencephalon that may correspond to the alar lamina, although this is uncertain. Their cavities are the future lateral ventricles and their walls are formed by the presumptive nervous tissue of the cerebral hemispheres. The roof plate of the median part of the telencephalon remains thin and is continuous behind with the roof plate of the diencephalon (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0115">Figs 14.26</a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0120">14.27</a>).

The rest of the hemisphere, i.e. the medial, lateral, dorsal and caudal regions, is the suprastriate part of the hemisphere. Although it is the largest in terms of surface area, initially it possesses comparatively thin walls. The rostral end of each oval hemisphere becomes the definitive frontal pole.

The progeny of these progenitors remain immediately extra-ependymal or partially displaced towards the pial exterior, and are arrested deeply embedded in the myelinating ‘white matter’ of the region. In marked contrast, proliferation and migration of neuroblasts in the cerebral hemispheres produce a superficial layer of grey matter in both the striate and the suprastriate regions, but not in the central areas of the original medial wall, where secondary fusion with the diencephalon occurs. The superficial layer of grey matter consists of neuronal somata, dendrites, the terminations of incoming (afferent) axons, extending outgrowing (efferent) axons, and glial and endothelial cells. Successive generations of neuroblasts migrate through the layers of earlier generations to attain subpial positions (see below and <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0150">Fig. 14.33</a>), which means that the outer, pial surface of the cerebral hemispheres expands at a rate greater than that of the hemispheres as a whole. The subpial region of grey matter is termed the cortex or pallium; a transient cortical subplate is seen. The growing hemispheres subsequently overlap, successively, the diencephalon and the mesencephalon, and then meet the rostral surface of the cerebellum. The temporal lobes embrace the flanks of the brainstem.</div><div class="text" id="p0690">The terminology used to describe regions of the cortex is based on evolutionary concepts. The oldest portions of cortex receive information concerned with olfaction and are termed archicortex (archipallium) and paleocortex (paleopallium): both are subdivisions of an overall allocortex. The archicortex is the forerunner of the hippocampal lobe, and the paleocortex gives rise to the piriform area. The remaining cortical surface expands greatly in mammals, forming the neocortex that displaces the earlier cortices so that they come to lie partially internally in each hemisphere. The typically six-layered mammalian neocortex is also described as isocortex.</div><section><a id="s7240"/><section><a id="s0240"/><h5 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0245">Lateral ventricles and choroid plexus</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0695">The early diverticulum or anlage of the cerebral hemisphere initially contains a simple spheroidal lateral ventricle continuous with the third ventricle via the interventricular foramen. The rim of the foramen is the site of the original evagination. The expanding ventricle develops the ram’s horn shape of the surrounding hemisphere, becoming first roughly ellipsoid and then a curved cylinder that is convex dorsally (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0130">Fig. 14.29</a>). The ends of the cylinder expand towards, but do not reach, the frontal and (temporary) occipital poles; differentiating and thickening neural tissues separate the ventricular cavities and pial surfaces at all points, except along the line of the choroidal fissure. Pronounced changes in ventricular form accompany the emergence of a temporal pole. The original caudal end of the curved cylinder expands within its substance and the temporal extensions in each hemisphere pass ventrolaterally to encircle both sides of the upper brainstem (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0120">Fig. 14.27</a>). Another extension may develop from the root of the temporal extension in the substance of the definitive occipital pole and pass caudomedially; it is quite variable in size, often asymmetric on the two sides, and one or both may be absent. Although the lateral ventricle is a continuous system of cavities, specific parts are now given regional names. The central part (body) extends from the interventricular foramen to the level of the posterior edge (splenium) of the corpus callosum. Three cornua (horns) diverge from the body: anterior towards the frontal pole, posterior towards the occipital pole, and inferior towards the temporal pole. At these early stages of hemispheric development, in most instances the term pole is preferred to lobe: lobes are defined by specific surface topographical features that will appear over several postmenstrual weeks, and differential growth patterns persist for a considerable period.</div><div class="text" id="p0700">The pia mater covers the epithelial roof of the third ventricle at this stage and is itself covered with loosely arranged mesenchyme and developing blood vessels. These vessels subsequently invaginate the roof of the third ventricle on each side of the median plane to form its choroid plexuses (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0120">Fig. 14.27</a>). The lower part of the medial wall of the cerebral hemisphere, which immediately adjoins the epithelial roof of the interventricular foramen and the rostral extremity of the diencephalon, also remains epithelial and consists of ependyma and pia mater. Elsewhere, the walls of the hemispheres are thickening to form the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="253" id="pagebreak_253"/><a id="pg253"/>pallium. The thin part of the medial wall of the hemisphere is invaginated by vascular tissue that is continuous in front with the choroid plexus of the third ventricle and constitutes the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle. This invagination occurs along a line that arches upwards and backwards, parallel with and initially limited to, the rostral and upper boundaries of the interventricular foramen. This curved indentation of the ventricular wall, where no nervous tissue develops between ependyma and pia mater, is termed the choroidal fissure (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0115">Figs 14.26C</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0120">14.27</a>). The subsequent assumption of the definitive form of the choroidal fissure depends on related growth patterns in neighbouring structures. Of particular importance are the relatively slow growth of the interventricular foramen; the secondary ‘fusion’ between the lateral diencephalon and medial hemisphere walls; the encompassing of the upper brainstem by the forward growth of the temporal lobe and its pole towards the apex of the orbit; and the massive expansion of two great cerebral commissures (the fornix and corpus callosum). The choroidal fissure is now clearly a caudal extension of the much-reduced interventricular foramen, which arches above the thalamus and is here only a few millimetres from the median plane. It diverges ventrolaterally near the caudal end of the thalamus, its curve reaching and continuing in the medial wall of the temporal lobe over much of its length (i.e. to the tip of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle). The upper part of the arch will be overhung by the corpus callosum and it is bordered by the fornix and its derivatives throughout its convexity.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0245"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0250">Basal nuclei</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0705">At first, growth proceeds more actively in the floor and the adjoining part of the lateral wall of the developing hemisphere, and thickenings of the ventricular zone formed by the rudimentary corpus striatum, often termed medial and lateral ganglionic (ventricular) eminences, develop from stage 18 (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0115">Figs 14.26</a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0130">14.29</a>). The head of the caudate nucleus appears as three successive parts, medial, lateral and intermediate. Caudally, these merge to form the tail of the caudate nucleus and the amygdaloid complex, which both remain close to the temporal pole of the hemisphere. When the occipital pole grows backwards and the general enlargement of the hemisphere carries the temporal pole downwards and forwards, the tail of the caudate is continued from the floor of the central part (body) of the lateral ventricle into the roof of its temporal extension, the future inferior horn (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0130">Fig. 14.29</a>). The amygdaloid complex encapsulates its tip. Rostrally, the head of the caudate nucleus extends forwards to the floor of the interventricular foramen, where it is separated from the developing rostral end of the thalamus by a groove; the head subsequently expands in the floor of the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle. The lentiform nucleus develops from two cellular laminae, medial and lateral, that are continuous with both the medial and lateral parts of the caudate nucleus. The internal capsule appears first in the medial lamina and extends laterally through the lateral lamina to the cortex. It divides the laminae into two, the internal parts join the caudate nucleus and the external parts form the lentiform nucleus (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0120">Figs 14.27</a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0125">14.28</a>): the remaining medial lamina cells give rise mainly to the globus pallidus and the lateral lamina cells to the putamen. The putamen expands concurrently with the intermediate part of the caudate nucleus.</div></section><section><a id="s0250"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0255">Fusion of diencephalic and telencephalic walls</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0710">As the hemisphere enlarges, the caudal part of its medial surface overlaps and hides the lateral surface of the diencephalon (thalamic part), from which it is separated by a narrow cleft occupied by vascular connective tissue. A transverse section made caudal to the interventricular foramen would pass from the third ventricular cavity successively through the developing thalamus, the narrow cleft just mentioned, the thin medial wall of the hemisphere, and the cavity of the lateral ventricle, with the corpus striatum in its floor and lateral wall (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0120">Fig. 14.27</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0715">As the thalamus increases in extent it acquires a superior surface in addition to medial and lateral surfaces. The lateral part of its superior surface fuses with the thin medial wall of the hemisphere so that this part of the thalamus is finally covered with the ependyma of the lateral ventricle immediately ventral to the choroidal fissure. As a result the corpus striatum is approximated to the thalamus and is separated from it only by a deep groove that becomes obliterated by increased growth along the line of contact. The lateral aspect of the thalamus is now in continuity with the medial aspect of the corpus striatum so that a secondary union between the diencephalon and the telencephalon is effected over a wide area, providing a route for the subsequent passage of projection fibres to and from the cortex (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0120">Fig. 14.27</a><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="254" id="pagebreak_254"/><a id="pg254"/>).</div></section><section><a id="s0255"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0260">Formation of the insula</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0720">At the end of the first trimester, while the corpus striatum is developing, growth between the frontal and temporal lobes is relatively restricted. The region lateral to the striatum becomes depressed to form a lateral cerebral fossa with a portion of cortex, the insula, at its base (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0130">Figs 14.29</a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0135">14.30</a>). As the temporal lobe continues to protrude towards the orbit, and with more rapid growth of the temporal and frontal cortices, the surface of the hemisphere expands at a rate greater than that of the hemisphere as a whole, and the cortical areas become folded, forming gyri and sulci. The insula is gradually overgrown by adjacent cortical regions that overlap it to form the opercula: the free margins of the opercula form the anterior part of the lateral fissure. This process is not completed until after birth. The lentiform nucleus remains deep to and coextensive with the insula.</div></section><section><a id="s0260"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0265">Olfactory bulb</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0725">A longitudinal groove appears in the anteromedial part of the floor of each developing lateral ventricle at about the stage 17. It deepens and forms a hollow diverticulum that is continuous with the hemisphere by a short stalk. The diverticulum becomes connected on its ventral or inferior surface to the olfactory placode. Placodal cells give rise to afferent axons that terminate in the walls of the diverticulum. As the head increases in size, the diverticulum grows forwards, loses its cavity and becomes converted into the solid olfactory bulb. The forward growth of the bulb is accompanied by elongation of its stalk to form the olfactory tract. The part of the floor of the hemisphere to which the tract is attached constitutes the piriform area.</div></section><section><a id="s0265"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0270">Olfactory nerve, limbic lobe and hippocampus</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0730">The growth changes in the temporal lobe that help to submerge the insula produce important changes in the olfactory and neighbouring limbic areas. The olfactory tract diverges into lateral, medial and (variable) intermediate striae as it approaches the hemispheric floor. The medial stria is clothed with a thin archicortical medial olfactory gyrus. This curves up into further archicortical areas rostral to the lamina terminalis (paraterminal gyrus, prehippocampal rudiment, parolfactory gyrus, septal nuclei) and these continue into the indusium griseum. The lateral stria, clothed by the lateral olfactory gyrus, and the intermediate stria (when present) terminate in the rostral parts of the piriform area, including the olfactory trigone and tubercle, anterior perforated substance, uncus and entorhinal area of the anterior part of the future parahippocampal gyrus. The lateral limit of the lateral stria is indicated by the rhinal sulcus. The forward growth of the temporal pole and the general expansion of the neocortex cause the lateral olfactory gyrus to bend laterally, the summit of the convexity lying at the anteroinferior corner of the developing insula. During the second trimester, much of the piriform area becomes submerged by the adjoining neocortex and, in the adult, only a part of it remains visible on the inferior aspect of the cerebrum.</div><div class="text" id="p0735">The limbic lobe is the first part of the cortex to differentiate. At first it forms a continuous, almost circular, strip on the medial and inferior aspects of the hemisphere. Below and in front, where the stalk of the olfactory tract is attached, it constitutes a part of the piriform area. The portion outside the curve of the choroidal fissure constitutes the hippocampal formation (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0120">Fig. 14.27</a>; <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0140"><span class="bold">Fig. 14.31</span></a>). In this region, the neural progenitors of the developing cortex proliferate and migrate. The wall of the hemisphere thickens, producing an elevation that projects into the medial side of the ventricle. The elevation is the hippocampus; it appears first on the medial wall of the hemisphere, in the area above and in front of the lamina terminalis (paraterminal area), and gradually extends backwards, curving into the region of the temporal pole, where it adjoins the piriform area. The marginal zone in the neighbourhood of the hippocampus is invaded by neurones to form the dentate gyrus. The hippocampus and the dentate gyrus extend from the paraterminal area backwards above the choroidal fissure and follow its curve downwards and forwards towards the temporal pole, where they continue into the piriform area. A shallow groove, the hippocampal sulcus, crosses the medial surface of the hemisphere throughout the hippocampal formation. The efferent fibres from the cells of the hippocampus collect along its medial edge and run forwards immediately above the choroidal fissure. Rostrally, they turn ventrally and enter the lateral part of the lamina terminalis to gain the hypothalamus, where they end in and around the mammillary body and neighbouring nuclei. These efferent hippocampal fibres form the fimbria hippocampi and the fornix.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0140"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000148/main.assets/f14-28-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0140"/><a id="fspara0140"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 14.31</span> The anterior and posterior commissures in the brain of a human fetus at postmenstrual week 16; medial aspect of the left half of the brain.</figcaption></figure></div></section><section><a id="s0270"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0275">Projection fibres, internal capsule</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0740">The growth of the neocortex, and its enormous expansion during the latter part of the first trimester, is associated with the initial appearance of corticofugal and corticopetal projection fibres and the internal capsule. The fibres follow the route provided by the apposition of the lateral aspect of the thalamus with the medial aspect of the corpus striatum. They divide the latter, almost completely, into a lateral part, the lentiform nucleus, and a medial part, the caudate nucleus; these two nuclei remain confluent only in their anteroinferior regions (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0120">Figs 14.27</a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0125">14.28</a>). The corticospinal tracts are first identified at the end of stage 23 at the pyramidal decussation. The lateral corticospinal tracts are in the cervical cord by postmenstrual weeks 14–15 and in the anterior corticospinal tract from about postmenstrual week 16 (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib79" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_79">Jin et al 2016</a>). The fibres destined for the cervical and upper thoracic regions, which innervate the upper limbs, are in advance of those that innervate the lower limbs, and these, in turn, are in advance of fibres that innervate the face; the timing of the appearance of reflexes associated with these three parts of the body is similarly staggered. The proportions of crossed and uncrossed fibres in each corticospinal tract vary; a dominant uncrossed corticospinal tract and a complete absence of pyramidal decussation have been found in posterior fossa anomalies such as occipital encephalocele, Dandy–Walker malformation and Joubert’s syndrome. There is evidence of substantial plastic reorganization of the motor cortex and corticospinal projections following pre- or perinatal lesions to the corticospinal system (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib52" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_52">Eyre 2007</a>).

Over the same period, the posterior part of the calcarine sulcus appears as a shallow groove extending forwards from a region near the occipital pole.

The roof plate of this area remains epithelial, while its floor becomes invaded by the decussating fibres of the optic nerves and developing hypothalamic nuclei. These two routes are thus not available for the passage of commissural fibres passing from hemisphere to hemisphere across the median plane, and these fibres therefore pass through the rostral wall of the interventricular foramen, i.e. the lamina terminalis. The first commissures to develop are those associated with the paleocortex and archicortex. Fibres of the olfactory tracts cross in the ventral or lower part of the lamina terminalis and, together with fibres from the piriform and pre-piriform areas and the amygdaloid bodies, form the rostral part of the anterior commissure (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0140">Fig. 14.31</a>; <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0145"><span class="bold">Fig. 14.32</span></a>).

Further backward growth of the trunk of the corpus callosum then results in the entrapped part of the limbic area becoming stretched out to form the bilateral septum pellucidum. As the corpus callosum grows backwards, it extends above the choroidal fissure, carrying the commissure of the fornix on its undersurface. In this way, a new floor is formed for the longitudinal fissure, and additional structures come to lie above the epithelial roof of the third ventricle. In its backward growth, the corpus callosum invades the area hitherto occupied by the upper part of the archicortical hippocampal formation, and the corresponding parts of the dentate gyrus and hippocampus are reduced to vestiges, the indusium griseum and the longitudinal striae.

Subplate neurones integrate into the intra- and extracortical circuitry and extend axons via the internal capsule towards the thalamus and superior colliculus at times before other cortical neurones have been born (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib82" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_82">Kanold and Luhmann 2010</a>).

The diverse cellular components of the subplate are embedded in an abundant hydrophilic extracellular matrix rich in secreted polymeric glycosaminoglycans, fibronectin and chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans that, for example, provide a major corridor for migrating GABAergic neurones (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib68" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_68">Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnar 2015</a>).

The marginal zone, the outermost layer of the developing cerebral cortex, will form layer 1. The neurones of the cortical plate and subplate form the neurones of the remaining cortical laminae (2–6), the complexity varies in different locations and with further additions of neurones from the deeper zones. The intermediate zone gradually transforms into the white matter of the hemisphere. Meanwhile, other deep progenitor cells produce generations of glioblasts that also migrate into the more superficial layers.

At its anterior extremity, this primitive internal carotid artery divides into cranial and caudal divisions. The former terminates as the primitive olfactory artery and supplies the developing regions implied (see <a href="../B9780702077050000173/B9780702077050000173.xhtml#f0045">Fig. 17.8</a>). The latter sweeps caudally to reach the ventral aspect of the midbrain; its terminal branches are the primitive mesencephalic arteries. Simultaneously, bilateral longitudinal channels differentiate along the ventral surface of the rhombencephalon from a plexus fed by intersegmental and transitory presegmental branches of the dorsal aorta and its forward continuation. The most important of the presegmental branches is closely related to the trigeminal nerve, the primitive trigeminal artery. Otic and hypoglossal presegmental arteries occur and may persist. The longitudinal channels later connect cranially with the caudal divisions of the internal carotid arteries (each of which gives rise to an anterior choroidal artery supplying branches to the diencephalon, including the telae choroideae and midbrain), and caudally with the vertebral arteries through the first cervical intersegmental arteries. Fusion of the longitudinal channels results in the formation of the basilar artery. The caudal division of the internal carotid artery becomes the posterior communicating artery and the stem of the posterior cerebral artery. The remainder of the posterior cerebral artery develops comparatively late, probably from the stem of the posterior choroidal artery, which is annexed by the caudally expanding cerebral hemisphere, its distal portion becoming a choroidal branch of the posterior cerebral artery. The posterior choroidal artery supplies the tela choroidea at the future temporal end of the choroidal fissure; its rami advance through the tela to become confluent with branches of the anterior choroidal artery. The cranial division of the internal carotid artery gives rise to anterior choroidal, middle cerebral and anterior cerebral arteries.

Caudally, similar meningeal branches arise from the vertebral and basilar arteries and embrace the cerebellum and brainstem. The further development of the telencephalon somewhat obscures this early pattern over the cerebrum.</div><div class="text" id="p0840">The meningeal arteries so formed have been classified into three groups: paramedian, short circumferential and long circumferential arteries. They can be described both supratentorially and infratentorially, and all give off fine side branches and end as penetrating arteries. Of the supratentorial vessels, the paramedian arteries have a short course prior to penetrating the cerebral neuropil (e.g. branches of the anterior cerebral artery); the short circumferential arteries have a slightly longer course before becoming penetrating arteries (e.g. the striate artery); and the long circumferential arteries reach the dorsal surface of the hemispheres. Infratentorial meningeal arteries are very variable. The paramedian arteries, after arising from the basilar or vertebral arteries, penetrate the brainstem directly. The short circumferential arteries end at the lateral surface of the brain before <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="259" id="pagebreak_259"/><a id="pg259"/>penetration and the long circumferential arteries later form the range of cerebellar arteries. These vessels, arranged as a series of loops over the brain, arise from the circle of Willis and brainstem vessels on the base of the brain.</div><div class="text" id="p0845">By postmenstrual week 16 the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries that contribute to the formation of the circle of Willis are well established. The leptomeningeal arteries arising from them display a simple pattern with little tortuosity and very few branches. With the increasing age of the fetus and acquisition of the gyral pattern on the surface of the brain, their tortuosity, diameter and number of branches all increase. The branching pattern is completed by postmenstrual week 28 and the number of branches does not increase further. Numerous anastomoses (varying in size from 200 to 760<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm) occur between the arteries in the depths of the developing sulci, nearly always in the cortical boundary zones of the three main cerebral arteries supplying each hemisphere. The number, diameter and location of these anastomoses change as fetal growth progresses, reflecting the regression and simplification of the complex embryonic cerebral vascular system.</div></section><section><a id="s0310"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0310">Vascularization of the brain</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0850">The brain becomes vascularized by angiogenesis rather than by direct invasion by angioblasts. The first indication of pia mater, containing a plexus of blood vessels that forms on the neural surface, is seen at stage 11 around the caudalmost part of the rhombencephalon and extends to the mesencephalic level by stage 12. The pial basement membrane is formed from interaction between neural crest cells, the meningeal extracellular matrix and the basal processes (end feet) of the radial glial cells. Meningeal extracellular matrix-mediated activation of integrins promotes proliferation of basal radial glia progenitors, which in turn sustain the expression of the extracellular matrix genes (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib142" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Silver et al 2019</a>). Vessels in the pial plexus sprout and form branches that elongate at the junction between the ventricular and marginal zones; the branches project laterally within the inter-rhombomeric boundaries and longitudinally adjacent to the median floorplate. Additional sprouts later penetrate the inter-rhombomeric regions on the walls and floor of the hindbrain. Branches from the hindbrain elongate towards and join the branches in the inter-rhombomeric junctions, forming primary vascular channels between rhombomeres and longitudinally on each side of the median floorplate. Later additional sprouts invade the hindbrain within the rhombomeres, anastomosing in all directions.</div><div class="text" id="p0855">Leptomeningeal perforating branches pass into the brain parenchyma as cortical, medullary and striate branches (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0160"><span class="bold">Fig. 14.36</span></a>). The cortical vessels supply the cortex via short branches that may form precapillary anastomoses, whereas the medullary branches supply the white matter. The medullary branches converge towards the ventricle but rarely reach it and often follow a tortuous course as they pass around bundles of nerves.

They supply a peripheral portion of the cerebrum and are grouped as ventriculopetal arteries. In contrast, striate branches arborize close to the ventricle and supply a more central portion of the cerebrum. Together with branches from the tela choroidea, they give rise to ventriculofugal arteries that supply the ventricular zone (germinal matrix of the brain) and also send branches towards the cortex. The ventriculopetal and ventriculofugal arteries run towards each other but do not anastomose. The ventriculopetal arteries form networks of small arterioles (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0160">Fig. 14.36</a>) and supply relatively more mature regions of the brain compared to the ventriculofugal vessels. The latter are subject to constant remodelling and do not develop tunicae mediae until ventricular zone proliferation is completed. The same pattern of centripetal and centrifugal arteries develops around the fourth ventricle. The ventriculofugal circulation is more extensive in the cerebellum than in the telencephalon. The arteries arise from the various cerebellar arteries and course with the cerebellar peduncles directly to the centre of the cerebellum, bypassing the cortex. The ventriculopetal arteries are derived from the meningeal vessels over the cerebellar surface and most terminate in the white matter.</div><div class="text" id="p0865">At postmenstrual week 24 the blood supply to the basal nuclei and internal capsule is relatively well developed, via a prominent Heubner’s artery (arteria recurrens anterior), a branch of the anterior cerebral artery. The cortex and the white matter regions are rather poorly vascularized at this stage. The distribution of arteries and veins on the lateral aspect of the cerebral hemispheres is affected by the formation of the lateral fissure and the development of cerebral sulci and gyri. Between postmenstrual weeks 12–20 the middle cerebral artery and its branches are relatively straight, branching in an open-fan pattern. At the end of postmenstrual week 20 the arteries become more curved as the opercula begin to appear and submerge the insular cortex. The area supplied by the middle cerebral artery becomes dominant when compared to the territories supplied by the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries. Early arterial anastomoses appear around postmenstrual week 16and increase in size with advancing fetal age. The sites of anastomoses between the middle and anterior cerebral arteries move from the convexity of the brain towards the superior sagittal sinus and anastomotic connections between the middle and posterior cerebral arteries shift towards the basal aspect of the brain.</div><div class="text" id="p0870">By postmenstrual weeks 32–34 marked involution of the ventricular zone (germinal matrix) has occurred and the cortex acquires its complex gyral pattern and an increased vascular supply. Ventricular zone capillaries are gradually remodelled to blend with the capillaries of the caudate nucleus. Heubner’s artery eventually supplies only a small area at the medial aspect of the head of the caudate nucleus. In the cortex, there is progressive elaboration of cortical blood vessels (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0160">Fig. 14.36</a>). Towards the end of the third trimester, the balance of cerebral circulation shifts from one that is central and basal nuclei-orientated, to one that predominantly serves the cortex and white matter.</div><section><a id="s0315"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0315">Vessels of the ventricular zone (germinal matrix) and formation of the blood–brain barrier</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0875">The capillary bed of the ventricular zone is supplied mainly by Heubner’s artery and terminal branches of the lateral striate arteries from the middle cerebral artery. The capillary channels in the ventricular zone open at right-angles directly into the veins. Subependymal veins (septal, choroidal, thalamostriate and posterior terminal) flow towards the interventricular foramen where there is a change of direction and the veins recurve at an acute angle to form the paired internal cerebral veins.</div><div class="text" id="p0880">Vessels within the ventricular and subventricular zones have been described as less mature than cortical vessels: their apparent fragility has been implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of intraventricular haemorrhage in premature infants. A rounded contour, relative paucity of pericytes, an immature basal lamina and a deficiency of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the ensheathing astrocyte end feet have all been cited as indicators of the immaturity of the microvasculature of the germinal matrix (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Ballabh 2010</a>). The ventricular and subventricular zones retain an embryonic capillary bed until cell proliferation is complete, which means that the highly cellular structure of the ventricular zone is a temporary feature. The capillary beds have the capacity to remodel after the ventricular cells finally differentiate as ependyma.</div><div class="text" id="p0885">The direct mutual support of two epithelial layers and their shared basal laminae, rather than support of an epithelium by a lamina propria is unique, seen elsewhere only in the kidney glomerular basement membrane and alveolar-capillary membrane (see <a href="../B9780702077050000112/B9780702077050000112.xhtml#f0015">Fig 11.2</a>). In the nervous system the cells of the neurovascular unit, endothelial, astrocyte and pericyte, form a blood–brain barrier that matures at different times in different brain regions during development. The permissive interactions between these epithelial phenotypes via their respective basal laminal secretions may contribute towards the patterning of the brain parenchymal spaces. Endothelial cells have a complex glycocalyx and are joined by tight and gap junctions; the integral membrane protein, occludin, spans the intracellular gaps between adjacent cells and claudins increase the hydraulic and electrical resistance across the endothelium (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib127" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_127">Pearce 2018</a>). Pericytes, sparse in fetal vessels, are required for endothelial–astrocyte barrier formation and disruption of pericyte–endothelial cell interaction may lead to barrier dysfunction. Cerebral vessels differ during development: their proximity to the great arteries; position in the cortex or white matter; reactions to fluctuating oxygen and carbon dioxide tissue levels; expression of membrane receptors; and recent vasoreactivity to a given stimulus, all contribute to their extensive functional heterogeneity (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib127" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Pearce 2018</a>).

Pial veins deep within the sulci drain this region, receiving superficial medullary veins at the grey/white matter interface and numerous fine short subcortical veins that may join arcuate veins within the cortex before draining into intracortical veins. The latter join cortical veins on the cerebral cortex that may attach to the dura or run within the dural layers towards the closest dural sinus. At the superior sagittal sinus, the cortical veins join at an acute angle, against the dural blood flow: this arrangement is thought to be due to differential growth of the cerebrum in the third trimester (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib129" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_129">Pearl et al 2011</a>).

The superior, middle, inferior, anterior and posterior cortical cerebral veins appear more tortuous than the meningeal arteries. Rapid cortical development correlates with the regression of the middle cerebral vein and its tributaries and the development of ascending and descending cortical veins. Cortical cerebral veins and the anastomoses between them can be identified from postmenstrual week 16. The inferior anastomotic vein (of Labbé), an anastomosis between the middle and inferior cerebral veins, becomes recognizable at postmenstrual week 20, and the superior anastomotic vein (of Trolard), connecting the superior and middle cerebral veins, is seen after the end of postmenstrual week 30.</div><div class="text" id="p0905">The ventricular zone capillary plexus is drained by a deep venous plexus that extends to the enlarging subcortical region.

The Babinski response, which involves extension of the great toe with spreading of the remaining toes in response to stimulation of the lateral aspect of the sole of the foot, is frequently elicited in neonates and reflects the level of myelination of the pathways. Early reflexes disappear in a predictable sequence reflecting postnatal myelination; their persistence suggests abnormal myelination of higher inhibitory pathways, seen in neurological developmental disorders and perinatal hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib55" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_55">Futagi et al 2012</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib53" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Feldman and Chaves-Gnecco 2018</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0965">By full-term the neonate at rest has a strong flexor tone accompanied by adduction of all limbs.

Examination of the motor system and evaluation of these reflexes allow assessment of the nervous system in relation to developmental age.

Production of otoacoustic emissions from sensory cell activity in the inner ear in response to sound is now routinely tested in neonates as an assessment of normal hearing.

Stimulation of the face or nasal cavity with water or local irritants produces apnoea in neonates. Breathing stops in expiration, with laryngeal closure, and neonates exhibit bradycardia and a lowering of cardiac output. Blood flow to the skin, splanchnic areas, muscles and kidneys decreases, whereas flow to the heart and brain is protected. Different fluids produce different effects when introduced into the pharynx of preterm infants. A comparison of the effects of water and saline in the pharynx showed that apnoea, airway obstruction and swallowing occur far more frequently with water than with saline, suggesting the presence of an upper airway chemoreflex. Reflux of gastric content into the oesophagus is a well-recognized cause of apnoea and constitutes an acute life-threatening event in infants. Reflex responses to the temperature of the face and nasopharynx are necessary to start pulmonary ventilation: in the past, midwives often blew on the faces of neonates to induce the first breath.</div><div class="text" id="p0975">Sucking and swallowing are a particularly complex set of reflexes, partly conscious and partly unconscious. As a combined reflex, sucking and swallowing require the coordination of several of the 12 pairs of cranial nerves. A neonate can, within the first couple of feeds, suck at the rate of once per second, swallow after five or six sucks, and breathe during every second or third suck. Air moves in and out of the lungs via the nasopharynx, and milk crosses the pharynx <span class="italic">en route</span> to the oesophagus without apparent interruption of breathing and swallowing, or significant misdirection of air into the stomach or fluids into the trachea. Swallowing movements are first noted at about postmenstrual week 11; <span class="italic">in utero</span> fetuses swallow 450<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>ml of amniotic fluid per day.

Coordinated activities are not noted before postmenstrual weeks 33–34. The concept of non-nutritive and nutritive sucking has been introduced to account for the different rates of sucking seen in a neonate. Non-nutritive sucking, when rhythmic negative intraoral pressures are initiated that do not result in the delivery of milk, can be spontaneous or stimulated by an object in the mouth. This type of sucking tends to be twice as fast as nutritive sucking; the sucking frequency for non-nutritive sucking is 1.7sucks/second in preterm infants of postmenstrual weeks 37–38, 2sucks/second in term (postmenstrual week 40) neonates, and 2.7sucks/second at postnatal months 7–9. Corresponding times for nutritive sucking are about 1 suck/second in term neonates, increasing to 1.5 sucks/second by postnatal month 7.</div><div class="text" id="p0985">The taste of the fluid, as well as nutrient content, affects the efficiency of nutritive sucking in the early neonatal period. There is more sucking with milk than with 5% dextrose: sucking activities increase with solutions that are determined to be sweet by adult appraisal. In full-term neonates, the placing of a spoon or food on to the anterior part of the tongue elicits an extrusion reflex: the lips are pursed and the tongue pushes vigorously against the object. By postnatal months 4–6, the reflex changes and food deposited on the anterior part of the tongue is moved to the back of the tongue, into the pharynx, and swallowed (see <a href="../B9780702077050000409/B9780702077050000409.xhtml">Ch. 40</a> for a description of swallowing in the adult). Rhythmic biting movements occur by postnatal months 7–9, even in the absence of teeth.</div><div class="text" id="p0990">Difficulties in sucking and swallowing in infancy may be an early indication of disturbed nervous system function. There is a correlation between feeding styles of neonates and later eating habits. Children who were obese at 1 and 2 years of age, as measured by triceps skin-fold thickness, had a feeding pattern in the first month of life that was characterized by sucking more rapidly, producing higher pressures during prolonged bursts of sucking, and having shorter periods between bursts of sucking. Fewer feeds and higher sucking pressure seem to be associated with greater adiposity (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">Agras et al 1987</a>). It has been noted that the levels of appetite-regulation hormones in fully breastfed infant serum are higher than in formula-fed infants at 4 postnatal months (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib157" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_157">Vásquez-Garibay et al 2019</a>).

This growth can be accounted for partly by increase in the size of neuronal cell bodies, the profusion and dimensions of their dendritic trees, axons and collaterals, and by the growth of the neuroglial cells and cerebral blood vessels, but mostly it reflects the myelination of many of the axons. During the second and subsequent years, growth proceeds much more slowly. The brain reaches 90% of its adult size by year 5, 95% by year 10, and adult size between years 17–18, largely as a result of the continuing myelination of various groups of nerve fibres.</div><div class="text" id="p1000">Maturational progression of neonatal and postnatal brains can be evaluated using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTMRI).

Evidence from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) suggests that myelination is a dominant process during the first year of life, starting centrally and spreading peripherally, and spreading rostrally from the occipital to the frontal lobe (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Dubois et al 2016</a>). Myelination of the corticospinal tracts starts in full-term neonates at about postnatal days 10–14 in the internal capsule and cerebral peduncles, and then proceeds simultaneously in both regions. Myelin appears to start first around longer axons, which presumably explains why, in the preterm infant, axial extension precedes flexion, whereas finger flexion precedes extension.</div><div class="text" id="p1005">Comparison of postnatal rates of myelination in human and primate brains shows that humans achieve approximately 60% of adult myelination during adolescence (compared to 96% in chimpanzees at comparable stages of growth).

After delivery, via processes similar to those seen in the postnatal synchronization of the optic pathways to ensure the development of the lateral geniculate nuclei and optic cortex, and of the auditory pathways to ensure postnatal maturation of hearing, the establishment of close mutual interactions between carer and neonate forms the basis for continuing infant cortical maturation and epigenetic upregulation of postnatal developmental genes. The continuing close reciprocal bond between carer and infant, with synchronization of a range of physiological rhythms, is described as the mother–infant dyad (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib132" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_132">Provenzi et al 2018</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1015">Establishment of the mother–infant dyad initially promotes infant motor activity, skin tactile input and via establishment of oral feeding routines, autonomic sensory experiences.

Later, the mother and family members encourage mirroring of behaviour (smiling and talking to the infant) and the infant becomes aware of its own sensory somatic states induced by the result of its motor actions. In this way the culturally driven rules for play and emotional display are transmitted to the infant. From psychological and sociological perspectives (i.e. through concepts of constructivist interactionism), the multiple ongoing interactions with the infant by family members (playing with the infant), and the resultant homeostatic interactions ongoing within the infant (feelings generated by their own movement), promote the development of cognitive pathways (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">Cantor et al 2018</a>). The development of these ‘salience’ networks and pathways (anterior insula to anterior cingulate) in the neonate are important for normal postnatal adaptive behaviour responses (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib182" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Molnar et al 2019</a>). Failure of these postnatal processes is recognized in stress responses and withdrawn behaviours in infants; infants do not cry if they learn no one will come, inhibiting their emotional expression even when their cortisol levels are high. In later life such individuals may have difficulties regulating intense feelings. Mothers who get less support during these times are reported to demonstrate more restraint, avoidant and anxious attachment to their offspring, which subsequently affects the infant. Establishment of the mother–preterm infant dyad is difficult, with immature salience network development involved in neuropsychiatric disorders seen in adults born preterm (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib182" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Molnar et al 2019</a>). The preterm infant is less alert, hypersensitive to stimulation, inefficient at oral feeding, with lower capacity for self-regulation. Mothers of preterm infants have heightened stress and anxiety and may respond by either overstimulation or subsequent decreased stimulation; maternal anxiety is associated with preterm infants being less facially responsive and this can lead to difficulty over time with responsive maternal facial interactions (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148_bib.xhtml#bib167" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_167">White-Traut et al 2013</a>).
