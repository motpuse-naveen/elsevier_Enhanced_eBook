Together, they provide multiple vital functions including: housing and protection of the digestive and urinary tracts and of the internal reproductive organs; a conduit for neurovascular communication between the thorax and lower limb; support and attachment for the external genitalia; access to and from the internal reproductive organs and urinary tract; assistance with physiological functions such as respiration, defecation and micturition; support for the vertebral column in weight-bearing, maintenance of posture and movement; and, in females, the ability to support gestation.</div><section><a id="s0015"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0025">Musculoskeletal framework of the abdomen and pelvis</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0015">The walls of the abdominopelvic cavity consist of five lumbar vertebrae and their intervening intervertebral discs (lying in the posterior midline); the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall lying anteriorly (rectus abdominis) and anterolaterally (transversus abdominis, internal abdominal oblique and external abdominal oblique); the muscles of the posterior abdominal wall (psoas major, quadratus lumborum and the respiratory diaphragm); the bony ‘basin’ formed by the walls of the greater and lesser pelves; the muscles of the pelvic diaphragm and perineum lying inferiorly; and the respiratory diaphragm lying superiorly (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 59.1</span></a>). In addition, the superior aspect of the abdominal cavity gains protection from the inferior six ribs and their cartilages, even though these structures are technically part of the thoracic wall.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000598/main.assets/f59-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 59.1</span> The bony and muscular structures making up the abdominopelvic cavity.

In standing, the linea terminalis lies at an angle of about 55° to the horizontal such that the anterior superior iliac spines and pubic tubercles are in approximately the same coronal plane. The mean angle between the superior border of the first segment of the sacrum and the horizontal plane is about 40–45° (<a href="#bib68" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_68">Woon et al 2013</a>).</div><section><a id="s0020"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0030">Thoracoabdominal interface</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0030">The respiratory diaphragm (diaphragm, thoracic diaphragm) constitutes the interface between the thoracic and abdominal cavities (<a href="../B9780702077050000550/B9780702077050000550.xhtml#f0055">Ch. 55</a>). There are three principal pathways between the two cavities across the respiratory diaphragm: the caval foramen in the central tendon transmits the inferior vena cava and right phrenic nerve; the oesophageal hiatus, encircled by the right crus of the respiratory diaphragm, transmits the oesophagus, vagal trunks and vessels; and the aortic hiatus, posterior to the median arcuate ligament, transmits the aorta, thoracic duct and, usually, the azygos vein. The hemiazygos vein usually enters the thorax through the left crus of the respiratory diaphragm. Other lymphatics from the abdomen drain to the thorax alongside the inferior vena cava and via small vessels passing through and around the respiratory diaphragm. Thoracic splanchnic nerves reach the abdomen through the crura of the respiratory diaphragm and posterior to the medial arcuate ligaments, and the left phrenic nerve pierces the left side of the respiratory diaphragm. The subcostal vessels pass into the abdomen posterior to the lateral arcuate ligaments of the respiratory diaphragm. Anteriorly, the superior epigastric vessels pass between the costal and xiphoid process attachments, i.e. sternocostal foramen of the respiratory diaphragm. Neurovascular structures also cross between the thorax and abdomen within the subcutaneous tissues.</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0035">Pelvis–lower limb interface</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0035">The pelvis forms an integral part of the bony structure of both the abdominopelvic cavity and the lower limbs. It transmits the weight of the upright body and provides a stable platform for movement of the hip joint and bipedal locomotion. Its bony surfaces provide attachment sites for the muscles of the buttock and thigh (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#c0077">Ch. 77</a>), the pelvic diaphragm and perineal membrane, the abdominal wall and lower back. The pelvis also transmits the neurovascular structures that supply the lower limb. There are four principal pathways between the pelvis and lower limb: the interval deep to the inguinal ligament anterior to the superior ramus of the pubis and ilium, which transmits the femoral neurovascular structures and lymphatics; the greater and lesser sciatic foramina, which transmit the gluteal vessels and nerves, sciatic nerve and internal pudendal vessels and pudendal nerve; and the obturator foramen, which transmits the obturator nerve, vessels and lymphatics. Autonomic nerves travel with the arterial supply to the lower limb and with the branches of the sacral plexus. Neurovascular structures also cross between the lower limb and pelvis within the subcutaneous tissues.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0040">General Arrangement of Abdominopelvic Autonomic Nerves</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0040">What follows is a brief overview of the autonomic nervous system in the abdominopelvic region; descriptions of the neurovascular supply to individual organs are given in the relevant chapters. The autonomic supply to the abdominal and pelvic viscera is via the abdominopelvic part of the sympathetic trunk and the greater, lesser and least thoracic splanchnic nerves (sympathetic), and the vagus and pelvic splanchnic nerves (parasympathetic). There are numerous interconnections between plexuses and ganglia, particularly in the major plexuses around the abdominal aorta; hence, the descriptions tend to be simplifications based on the ‘main’ supply to each organ (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 59.2</span></a>).

Myelinated axons from these neurones travel in the ventral ramus of the spinal nerve of the same segmental level, leaving it via a white ramus communicans to enter a thoracic or lumbar ganglion. Visceral branches can exit at the same level or ascend or descend several levels in the sympathetic trunk before exiting; they leave the ganglia without synapsing and pass medially, giving rise to the paired greater, lesser and least thoracic splanchnic nerves and to the lumbar and sacral splanchnic nerves. Axons destined to supply somatic structures synapse in the sympathetic ganglion of the same level, and postganglionic, unmyelinated axons leave the ganglion as one or more grey rami communicantes to enter the spinal nerve of the same segmental level.</div><section><a id="s0045"/><section><a id="s0050"/><h4 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0050">Greater thoracic splanchnic nerve</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0055">On each side, the greater thoracic splanchnic nerve is derived from the medial branches of the fifth to ninth thoracic ganglia.

Other postganglionic sympathetic nerves to vessels and skin travel with somatic nerves. Thus, the femoral nerve carries vasoconstrictor sympathetic nerves to the femoral artery and its branches in the thigh, as well as sympathetic fibres in its cutaneous branches. Postganglionic fibres travelling with the obturator nerve supply the obturator artery and a variable patch of skin of the medial thigh. Sympathetic denervation of vessels in the lower limb can occur by removing or ablating the proximal three lumbar ganglia and intervening parts of the sympathetic trunk; this procedure can be useful for treating some varieties of vascular insufficiency of the lower limb.</div></section><section><a id="s0075"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0075">Lumbar splanchnic nerves</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0090">Four lumbar splanchnic nerves pass as medial branches from the ganglia to join the coeliac, inferior mesenteric and superior hypogastric plexuses (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 59.4</a>). The first lumbar splanchnic nerve, from the first ganglion of the lumbar part of the sympathetic trunk, gives branches to the coeliac, renal and inferior mesenteric plexuses. The second lumbar splanchnic nerve joins the inferior part of the intermesenteric or inferior mesenteric plexus. The third lumbar splanchnic nerve arises from the third or fourth ganglion and joins the superior hypogastric plexus. The fourth lumbar splanchnic nerve from the lowest ganglion joins the distal part of the superior hypogastric plexus, or the hypogastric nerve. It is important to note that lumbar splanchnic nerves contribute to the superior and inferior hypogastric plexuses and therefore to the innervation of the neck of the urinary bladder, ductus deferens and prostate, among other structures. Injury to these nerves, e.g. during aortoiliac surgery, can result in sexual dysfunction.</div></section><section><a id="s0080"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0080">Pelvic sympathetic system</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0095">The sacral part of the sympathetic trunk usually consists of four or five ganglia located medial or anterior to the anterior sacral foramina posterior to the presacral fascia (<a href="#bib48" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_48">Oh et al 2004</a>). Occasionally, one or two coccygeal ganglia are present. The sacral part of the sympathetic trunk is continuous above with the lumbar part of the sympathetic trunk, and preganglionic fibres descend from the distal lumbar spinal cord segments via this route. The first sacral ganglion is the largest. Ganglia become progressively smaller in the caudal direction (<a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Blaszczyk 1981</a>). The sacral sympathetic trunk is often asymmetric, with absent or fused ganglia, and cross-communications between sides are frequent. Each ganglion sends at least one grey ramus communicans to its adjacent spinal nerve but up to 11 such branches from a single ganglion have been reported (<a href="#bib52" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_52">Potts 1925</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0100">The sacral part of the sympathetic trunk converges caudally to form a solitary retroperitoneal structure, the ganglion impar (ganglion of Walther), which lies at a variable level between the sacrococcygeal joint and the apex of the coccyx; it is occasionally paired, unilateral or absent (<a href="#bib48" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Oh et al 2004</a>). It conveys sympathetic fibres to and nociceptive afferents from the perineum and terminal urogenital regions. Anaesthetic blockade of the ganglion impar can be used to treat intractable perineal pain carried by visceral afferent fibres in patients with pelvic cancers (<a href="#bib64" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_64">Toshniwal et al 2007</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0085"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0085">Somatic and vascular branches</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0105">Grey rami communicantes containing postganglionic sympathetic nerves pass from the pelvic sympathetic ganglia to the sacral and coccygeal spinal nerves.

Traditionally, the vagus nerves have been said to supply parasympathetic innervation to the abdominal viscera as far as the distal transverse colon, i.e. they supply derivatives of the foregut and midgut. Derivatives of the hindgut are supplied by parasympathetic fibres travelling via the pelvic splanchnic nerves (see below); the overlap between these two supplies is variable. The vagal trunks are derived from the oesophageal plexus and enter the abdomen via the oesophageal hiatus, closely related to the anterior and posterior walls of the abdominal part of the oesophagus (see <a href="../B9780702077050000562/B9780702077050000562.xhtml#f0030">Fig. 56.6</a>). The anterior vagal trunk is mostly derived from the left vagus nerve and the posterior vagal trunk from the right vagus nerve. The nerves supply the abdominal part of the oesophagus and stomach directly. The anterior vagal trunk gives off a hepatic branch, which innervates the liver and its vasculature, including the gallbladder and bile ducts, and the other structures in the free edge of the lesser omentum (hepatoduodenal ligament). The posterior vagal trunk supplies branches to the coeliac plexus; these fibres frequently constitute the largest portion of the fibres contributing to the plexus. They arise directly from the posterior vagal trunk and from its gastric branch, and run posterior to the peritoneum, deep to the posterior wall of the superior part of the omental bursa, to reach the coeliac plexus. Their synaptic relays with postganglionic neurones are situated in the myenteric (Auerbach’s) and submucosal (Meissner’s) plexuses in the wall of the hollow viscera (see below).</div><section><a id="s0110"/><section><a id="s0115"/><h5 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0100">Pelvic splanchnic nerves</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0120">Pelvic splanchnic nerves to the pelvic viscera travel in the ventral rami of the second, third and fourth sacral spinal nerves. They leave the nerves as they exit the anterior sacral foramina and pass in the presacral tissue as a fine network of branches that are distributed to three principal destinations. Most pass anterolaterally into the network of nerves that form the inferior hypogastric plexus; from there, they pass to the pelvic viscera. Some join directly with the hypogastric nerves and ascend out of the pelvis as far as the superior hypogastric plexus; from there they are distributed with branches of the inferior mesenteric artery (<a href="../B9780702077050000653/B9780702077050000653.xhtml#f0065">Ch. 65</a>). A few run superolaterally in the presacral fascia, over the linea terminalis anterior to the left iliac vessels, and pass directly into the tissue of the retroperitoneum toward the sigmoid and descending colons. The pelvic splanchnic nerves are motor to the smooth muscle of the derivatives of the hindgut and wall of the urinary bladder, supply vasodilator fibres to the erectile tissues of the penis and clitoris, and are secretomotor to the derivatives of the hindgut.</div><div class="text" id="p0125">An experimental study of the differential expression of transcription factors in embryonic mice argued that thoracic and sacral pools of preganglionic neurones share a common sympathetic identity and that the sacral autonomic outflow should therefore be regarded as sympathetic (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Espinosa-Medina et al 2016</a>).

The coordinated activity of the two muscle layers produces a characteristic motor behaviour that is mainly propulsive and directed aborally (peristalsis), combined with a non-propulsive motor activity that either mixes the luminal contents, as occurs in the stomach, or partitions them, as occurs at the pyloric sphincter. The muscle maintains a constant volume, so that shortening of a segment of the wall of the hollow viscus is accompanied by thickening of the muscle layer.</div><div class="text" id="p0285">Intestinal smooth muscle exhibits variable and changing degrees of contraction on which rhythmic (or phasic) contractions are superimposed. Slow waves of rhythmic electrical activity, driven by changes in membrane potentials in pacemaker cells (interstitial cells), spread throughout the thickness of the circular and longitudinal smooth muscle coats. After spreading circumferentially, slow waves can move in either oral or anal directions, causing segmental contraction. The distances of propagation and the patterns of this spontaneous activity differ among areas of the intestine. Neural regulation of slow and phasic contractions involves excitatory and inhibitory transmitters that are released from the myenteric plexus. This motor control is closely coordinated with mucosal absorption and secretion, and is mediated via intrinsic nerves in the submucous plexus. The peristaltic reflex occurs during passage of luminal contents down the intestine. It involves ascending contraction and descending relaxation; the sensory limb is mediated by sensory neurones that respond to either mucosal stimulation (intrinsic primary afferents) or muscle stretch (extrinsic afferents).</div><section><a id="s0300"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0225">Interstitial cells</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0290">Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) are found throughout the length of the gastrointestinal tract, where they lie in close contact with nerve terminals; they have numerous gap junctions with each other and with smooth muscle cells.

Looser arrangements exist within the individual muscle layers and the submucosa of the wall of the hollow viscera, and isolated or small groups of ICCs are also found in the subserosal region. ICCs originate from mesenchymal cells and resemble smooth muscle cells but have fewer contractile elements and their intermediate filaments contain vimentin rather than desmin.

The cell bodies of preganglionic parasympathetic axons are found in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve in the medulla oblongata and in the second to fourth sacral segments of the spinal cord. Their main targets in the wall of the hollow viscera are the enteric neurones of the myenteric plexus. The vagus nerve plays a major role in oesophageal propulsion, gastric acid secretion and emptying of the stomach, gallbladder contraction and pancreatic exocrine secretion. Pelvic splanchnic nerves innervate the distal colon and rectum. Sympathetic neurones have their preganglionic cell bodies in the intermediolateral grey matter (lamina VII) of the thoracolumbar segments of the spinal cord; those destined for the smooth muscle of the wall of the hollow viscera mostly pass through the sympathetic trunk without synapsing and relay in prevertebral ganglia (coeliac, mesenteric and pelvic), whereas those mediating vasoconstriction synapse in the sympathetic trunk or prevertebral ganglia. Postganglionic sympathetic fibres are distributed with the branches of the coeliac trunk and mesenteric arteries to three principal targets: the myenteric and submucosal ganglia (causing inhibition), blood vessels (inducing vasoconstriction) and sphincter muscles (inducing contraction).</div><div class="text" id="p0320">Visceral sensory fibres are distributed throughout the layers of the walls of the hollow viscera. They respond to various stimuli including excessive muscular contraction or distension, ischaemia and inflammation; their cell bodies are located in the inferior ganglion of the vagus nerve and in thoracic and lumbosacral spinal ganglia (visceral afferent <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1116" id="pagebreak_1116"/><a id="pg1116"/>fibres that run with sympathetic efferent fibres). Their central projections reach the brain stem and spinal cord, respectively. Sensory fibres in the vagus nerve are more numerous in the derivatives of the foregut than those of the derivatives of the midgut and are concerned with physiological responses such as satiety, whereas pain and discomfort are mediated by spinal pathways.</div></section><section><a id="s0335"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0250">Intrinsic innervation</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0325">The intrinsic innervation of the gastrointestinal tract is derived from enteric neurones distributed throughout its wall in thousands of small ganglia, each consisting of neuronal cell bodies supported by enteric glial cells; it is estimated that there are between 200 and 600 million neurones in the human enteric nervous system. Enteric neurones are derived from neural crest cells and innervate the hollow viscera from oesophagus to anus, together with the pancreas and bile ducts.</div><div class="text" id="p0330">Most of the enteric neurones in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract are found in two ganglionated plexuses (<a href="#f0045"><span class="bold">Fig. 59.9</span></a>). The most extensive of these is the myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus, which consists of a network of nerve fibres and small ganglia lying between the circular and longitudinal layers of the muscularis externa. It runs in continuity from the oesophagus to the anus. The submucosal (Meissner’s) plexus has outer and inner components and is present throughout the intestines but is absent or minimal in the oesophagus and stomach (<a href="#bib45" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_45">Nagy and Goldstein 2017</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0045"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000598/main.assets/f59-09-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0045"/><a id="fspara0045"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 59.9</span> The organization of the enteric nervous system in the small intestine.

Nerve fibre bundles connect the ganglia and form plexuses innervating the longitudinal muscle, circular muscle, muscularis mucosae, intrinsic arteries and mucosa. Axons of extrinsic origin also run in these nerve fibre bundles. There are also innervations of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) endocrine cells and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which are not shown here. <br/><span class="figcredit">Redrawn from Furness JB.

Collectively, they are involved in a hierarchy of enteric reflexes that include local reflexes within the wall of the hollow viscera; reflexes mediated through prevertebral ganglia; and reflexes mediated through the central nervous system (the gut–brain axis). The functions of enteric neurones can be further modulated by local environmental factors, e.g. enteric glia, gut microbiota and feeding state, and by general factors in the host, e.g. the immune system, stress and disease (<a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Brierley and Linden 2014</a>).

The aim is to minimize or eliminate external incisions and hasten the patient’s recovery, whilst providing optimum treatment of the pathology with an acceptably low risk of complications. In the abdomen and pelvis it includes therapeutic procedures performed using an endoscope inserted via the mouth (gastroscope or duodenoscope), anus (proctoscope, sigmoidoscope or colonoscope), urethra (cystoscope or ureteroscope) or vagina, or via small surgical incisions in the anterior or posterior abdominal wall (laparoscope and other endoscopic systems).</div><div class="text" id="p0590">A refinement of the technique is natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, in which abdominal operations are performed using an endoscope inserted through a natural orifice (e.g. mouth, anus, urethra) and then through an incision in the viscus that has been entered (e.g. stomach, urinary bladder, vagina). For example, pelvic and intra-abdominal contents can be accessed through the vagina via the recto-uterine pouch. Hysterectomy, oophorectomy, pelvic organ prolapse repair and incontinence surgery are commonly performed using transvaginal techniques. This approach avoids the morbidity of abdominal incision but there are risks of sciatic, femoral and common fibular nerve injury from prolonged surgery in the lithotomy position.</div><div class="text" id="p0595">A further development of endoscopic minimally invasive surgery has been the introduction of robotically assisted surgery, which allows the surgeon to manipulate precision instruments from a console remote from the patient whilst viewing the operative field in three dimensions.
