The blastocyst is present within the uterine cavity for some 72 hours prior to implantation, and during this time there is an interactive dialogue between the implanting blastocyst and endometrial decidual stromal cells (<a href="#bib68" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_68">Makieva et al 2018</a>). <span class="italic">In vitro</span> culture of human preimplantation embryos shows that normally developed preimplantation human blastocysts actively enhance the uterine environment for their implantation, whereas developmentally impaired embryos induce endoplasmic reticulum stress responses in decidual cells that inhibit implantation (<a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Brosens et al 2014</a>). Reponses from endometrial stromal cells also inform these interactions (<a href="#bib68" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Makieva et al 2018</a>, <a href="#bib86" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_86">Zhang et al 2018</a>). Uterine surgical scars may have a long-term impact on the interactive dialogue between the implanting blastocyst and endometrial decidual stromal cells (<a href="#bib65" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_65">Jauniaux et al 2018</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0015">The trophoblast of the blastocyst gives rise to three main cell types in the human placenta: syncytiotrophoblast that forms the epithelial covering of the villous tree and is the main endocrine component of the placenta; villous cytotrophoblast cells that represent a germinative population that proliferates throughout pregnancy, fusing to generate syncytiotrophoblast; and extravillous trophoblast cells that are non-proliferative and invade the maternal endometrium. The first two cell lines can be seen from stages 4 and 5 onwards. The cytotrophoblast cells that form the mural and polar trophoblast are cuboidal. Following apposition of the blastocyst to the uterine mucosa, the polar trophoblast becomes covered externally with syncytiotrophoblast, a multinucleated tissue that penetrates between the epithelial cells (see <a href="../B9780702077050000082/B9780702077050000082.xhtml#f0055">Fig. 8.10</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0020">Preimplantation embryos produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that mediate penetration of the maternal subepithelial basal lamina by the syncytiotrophoblast. Trophoblast cells express L-selectin (usually seen as a mediator of neutrophil rolling and tethering in inflamed endothelium), and the endometrial epithelium upregulates selectin–oligosaccharide-based ligands (<a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_44">Fukuda and Sugihara 2008</a>). Thus, differentiating cytotrophoblast cells appear to use processes that also occur in vasculogenesis and during leukocyte migration from the blood into the tissues. Flanges of syncytiotrophoblast grow between the cells of the uterine luminal epithelium towards the underlying basal lamina without apparent damage to the maternal cell membranes or disruption of the intercellular junctions. Instead, shared junctions, including tight junctions, are formed with many of the maternal uterine epithelial cells.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">Implantation continues with erosion of the vascular endothelium of maternal superficial capillaries and glandular epithelium and phagocytosis of the glandular secretions. There is increasing evidence that the endometrial stromal cells grow around and encapsulate the blastocyst until it occupies an uneven implantation cavity in the stroma (interstitial implantation) (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 9.1</span></a>). In the early postimplantation phase, the uterine surface is resealed by re-epithelialization and the formation of a plug that may contain fibrin. As the blastocyst burrows more deeply into the endometrium, syncytiotrophoblast forms over the mural cytotrophoblast, but never achieves the thickness of the syncytiotrophoblast over the embryonic pole.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000094/main.assets/f09-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 9.1</span> The implanting conceptus at stage 6.

This hCG prolongs the life of the corpus luteum, which continues to secrete progesterone and oestrogens until these essential hormones are produced by the placenta. For details of postfertilization and postmenstrual ages see <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 23.3</a>.</div><div class="text" id="p0035">Menstruation ceases on successful implantation and the endometrium transforms into the decidua to form a suitable nidus for the conceptus. Decidualization of the endometrial stroma may occur without an intrauterine pregnancy, for example in the presence of an ectopic pregnancy, after prolonged treatment with progesterone, and in the late secretory phase of a non-conception cycle. Decidual differentiation is not evident in the stroma at the earliest stages of implantation, and it may not be until a week later that fully differentiated cells are present. During decidualization, the interglandular tissue increases in quantity (<a href="#bib30" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_30">Burton et al 2010</a>). It contains a substantial population of leukocytes (large granular lymphocytes, macrophages and T cells) distributed amongst large decidual cells.</div><div class="text" id="p0040">The most numerous are uterine natural killer (NK) cells that accumulate in the endometrium during the secretory phase of the cycle and persist until mid-pregnancy; they interact with invading extravillous trophoblast cells that express human leukocyte antigens G and C (HLA-G, HLA-C).</div><div class="text" id="p9050">Decidual cells are stromal cells that contain varying amounts of glycogen, lipid and vimentin-type intermediate filaments in their cytoplasm. They are generally rounded but their shape may vary, depending on the local packing density. They may contain one, two or sometimes three nuclei, frequently display rows of club-like cytoplasmic protrusions enclosing granules, and are associated with a characteristic capsular basal lamina. Decidual cells produce a range of secretory products that may be taken up by the trophoblast, including insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGF-BP1) and prolactin. Prolactin signals to the endometrial glands to increase their secretions and may play a role in the maintenance and growth of the conceptus in the early phase of postimplantational development via histotrophic nutrition (<a href="#bib82" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_82">Turco et al 2017</a>): it can be detected in amniotic fluid in the first trimester of pregnancy.</div><div class="text" id="p0050">Extracellular matrix, growth factors and protease inhibitors produced by the decidua all probably modulate the degradative activity of the trophoblast and support placental morphogenesis and placental accession to the maternal blood supply. Once implantation is complete, distinctive names are applied to different regions of the decidua (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 9.2</span></a>). The decidua capsularis covers the conceptus; the decidua basalis (where the placenta subsequently develops) lies between the conceptus and the uterine muscular wall; the decidua parietalis lines the remainder of the body of the uterus. Subsets of perivascular and stromal cells in distinct decidual layers probably mediate regulatory interactions that prevent harmful innate or adaptive immune responses at the maternal-fetal interface in early human pregnancy (<a href="#bib840" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_840">Vento-Tormo et al 2018</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000094/main.assets/f09-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 9.2</span> The gravid uterus at about postmenstrual week 9.

The development of primary, secondary and anchoring villi, and the local differentiation of haemangioblast cells within them, occur concurrently with the modification of maternal blood vessels to ensure their patency. By embryonic stage 10, with the onset of the embryonic heartbeat, a primitive circulation between the embryo and the secondary yolk sac is established. Blood vessels within the walls of the allantois and connecting stalk connect the embryonic circulation to the developing placenta during postmenstrual weeks 6–12, forming a low-oxygen environment with nutrition from endometrial glands. From postmenstrual week 12, maternal blood flows into the placental intervillous spaces and a fetoplacental circulation is fully established.</div><div class="text" id="p0060">As the blastocyst implants, the syncytiotrophoblast invades the uterine tissues, including the glands and walls of maternal blood vessels (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 9.1</a>; <a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 9.3</span></a>), and increases rapidly in thickness over the embryonic pole (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 9.4</span></a>). Microvillus-lined clefts and lacunar spaces develop within the syncytiotrophoblastic envelope (postfertilization days 9–11) and establish communications with one another. Initially, many of these spaces contain maternal blood derived from dilated uterine capillaries and veins, as the walls of the vessels are partially destroyed.

Capillaries develop in the mesenchymal core of the villi during postfertilization week 3. The cytotrophoblast within the villi continues to grow through the invading syncytiotrophoblast and makes direct contact with the decidua basalis, forming anchoring villi. Further cytotrophoblast proliferation occurs laterally so that neighbouring outgrowths meet to form a spherical cytotrophoblastic shell around the conceptus (<a href="#f0030"><span class="bold">Fig. 9.5</span></a>; see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 9.3B</a>).

These extravillous cells are the third lineage of the original trophoblastic cells. Extravillous trophoblast cells may be interstitial or endovascular.

During the first trimester, development takes place in a physiologically low-oxygen environment supported by histotrophic nutrition from the endometrial glands which discharge into the intervillous space (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 9.3A</a>) (<a href="#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Burton et al 2002</a>, <a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_28">Burton et al 2007</a>, <a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Burton and Fowden 2012</a>). When maternal blood bathes the surfaces of the chorion bounding the intervillous space, the human placenta is defined as haemochorial. Different grades of fusion exist between the maternal and fetal tissues in many other mammals (e.g. epitheliochorial, synepitheliochorial, endotheliochorial). The chorion is vascularized by the allantoic blood vessels of the body stalk, and so the human placenta can be termed chorio-allantoic (in some mammals, a choriovitelline placenta exists either alone or supplements the chorio-allantoic variety). It can also be defined as discoidal (in contrast to other shapes in other mammals), and deciduate (because maternal tissue is shed with the placenta and membranes at parturition as part of the afterbirth).</div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><section><a id="s0025"/><section><a id="s0030"/><h3 class="h3hd" id="p9020">Growth of the placenta</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0080">Expansion of the entire conceptus is accompanied by radial growth of the villi and simultaneous integrated tangential growth and expansion of the trophoblastic shell. Eventually, each villous stem forms a complex that consists of a single trunk attached by its base to the chorion, from which second- and third-order branches (intermediate and terminal villi, respectively) arise distally. Terminal villi are specialized for exchange between fetal and maternal circulations; each one starts as a syncytial outgrowth and is invaded by cytotrophoblast cells, which then develop a core of fetal mesenchyme as the villus continues to grow. The core is vascularized by fetal capillaries (each villus undergoes sequential histological differentiation forming primary, secondary and tertiary types). The germinal cytotrophoblast continues to add cells that fuse with the overlying syncytium and so contribute to the expansion of the haemochorial interface. Terminal villi continue to form and branch within the confines of the definitive placenta throughout gestation, projecting in all directions into the intervillous space (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 9.5</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0085">Up to postmenstrual week 8 (postfertilization week 6; for comparison of postfertilization and postmenstrual ages see <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 23.3</a>), the entire chorion is covered with villous stems that are thus continuous peripherally with the trophoblastic shell, which is in close apposition with the decidua capsularis and the decidua basalis. The villi adjacent to the decidua basalis are stouter and longer and show a greater profusion of villi. As the conceptus continues to expand, the decidua capsularis is progressively compressed and thinned, the circulation through it is gradually reduced, and adjacent villi slowly atrophy and disappear. This process starts at the abembryonic pole (opposite to the implantation site): by the first trimester, the abembryonic hemisphere of the conceptus is largely denuded. Eventually, the whole chorion apposed to the decidua capsularis is smooth and is now termed the chorion laeve. It will later become apposed to the amnion, forming the chorio-amnion or placental <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="180" id="pagebreak_180"/><a id="pg180"/>free membranes (see <a href="#f0015">Figs 9.2</a>, <a href="#f0055">9.10</a>). In contrast, the villous stems of the disc-shaped region of chorion apposed to the decidua basalis increase greatly in size and complexity, and the region is now termed the chorion frondosum (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 9.4</a>). The chorion frondosum and the decidua basalis constitute the definitive placental site (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 9.2</a>). Abnormalities in this process may account for the persistence of villi at abnormal sites in the chorion laeve of the gestational sac and the presence of accessory or succenturiate lobes within the membranes of the definitive placenta. The presence of the entire villous ring of the primitive placenta beyond postmenstrual week 8 may lead to the development of placenta membranacea, a giant definitive placental structure surrounding the whole gestational sac during the remainder of pregnancy and covering the entire uterine cavity including the internal os of the cervix.</div><div class="text" id="p0090">Coincidentally with the growth of the embryo and the expansion of the amnion, the decidua capsularis is thinned and distended, and the space between it and the decidua parietalis is gradually obliterated. The three endometrial strata recognizable in the premenstrual phase, compactum, spongiosum and basale, are better differentiated and easily distinguished. The glands in the spongiosum are compressed and appear as oblique slit-like fissures lined by low cuboidal cells. By postmenstrual week 9, the decidua capsularis and decidua parietalis are in contact. By postmenstrual weeks 17–20, the decidua capsularis is greatly thinned, and it almost disappears during the succeeding weeks.</div><div class="text" id="p0095">When the placenta grows in the area of a previous uterine scar, both the extravillous trophoblast and some of the villi may develop beyond the normal junctional zone of the inner myometrium (<a href="#bib65" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Jauniaux et al 2018</a>).

These cells penetrate as far as the inner third of the myometrium but can often be observed at or near the decidual–myometrial junction. They are not found in the decidua parietalis or the adjacent myometrium, suggesting that the placental bed giant cell represents a differentiative end stage in the extravillous trophoblast lineage. The striae of fibrinoid are irregularly interconnected and variable in prominence.

These septa circumscribe the uterine surface of the placenta into 15–30 lobes, often termed cotyledons, each surrounding a limited portion of the intervillous space associated with a villous trunk from the chorionic plate. From postmenstrual week 13–14, these septa are supported by tissue from the decidua basalis.

From the chorionic plate, progressive branching occurs into the villous tree, as stem villi give way to intermediate and terminal villi. Each villus has a core of connective tissue containing collagen types I, III, V and VI, as well as fibronectin.

Cytotrophoblastic sprouts covered in syncytium are present in the first and second trimesters and represent a stage in the development of new villi. Columns of cytotrophoblast at the tips of anchoring villi extend from the villous basal lamina to the maternal decidual stroma. Cytotrophoblastic cells persist until term but, because the increase in villous surface area outstrips their proliferation, they are usually disposed singly.</div><div class="text" id="p0175">The cells of the villous cytotrophoblast (Langhans cells) are pale-staining with a slight basophilia. Ultrastructurally, they have a rather electron-translucent cytoplasm and relatively few organelles and contain intermediate filaments, particularly in association with desmosomes.

Sometimes, the intercellular gap widens to accommodate microvillous projections from the cell surfaces and occasionally it contains patches of fibrinoid. A smaller population of intermediate cytotrophoblast may also be found in the chorionic villi. This postmitotic population represents a state of partial differentiation between the cytotrophoblast stem cell and the overlying syncytium.</div><div class="text" id="p0180">The syncytiotrophoblast is the multinucleated epithelium of the placenta. It is an intensely active tissue layer, across which most transplacental transport must occur (<a href="#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_41">Ellery et al 2009</a>). It is also a selectively permeable barrier that allows water, oxygen and other nutritive substances and hormones to pass from mother to fetus, and some of the products of excretion to pass from fetus to mother. It secretes a range of placental hormones into the maternal circulation. Syncytial cytoplasm is more strongly basophilic than that of the cytotrophoblast cells, and is packed with organelles consistent with its secretory phenotype. Where the plasma membrane adjoins basal lamina, it is often infolded into the cytoplasm, whereas the surface bordering the intervillous space is set with numerous long microvilli.</div><div class="text" id="p0185">Glycolysis is maintained in placental tissues by re-oxidation of pyridine nucleotides through the polyol pathways. The reliance on glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation preserves carbon skeletons that can be utilized in the synthesis of nucleotides, cell membranes and organelles, and that would otherwise be excreted as carbon dioxide. In the placenta, this reliance may protect the embryo from free radical-mediated teratogenesis (<a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Burton et al 2017</a>). Glycogen is thought to be present in both layers of the trophoblast at all stages, although it is not always possible to demonstrate its presence histochemically.</div><div class="text" id="p0190">Lipid droplets occur in both layers and are free in the core of the villus. In the trophoblast, they are found principally within the cytoplasm, but they also occur in the extracellular space between cytotrophoblast and syncytium, and between the individual cells of the cytotrophoblast. The droplets diminish in number with advancing age and may represent fat in transit from mother to fetus, and/or a pool of precursors for steroid synthesis. Membrane-bound granular bodies of moderate electron density occur in the cytoplasm, particularly in the syncytium, and some are probably secretion granules. Other membrane-bound bodies, lysosomes and phagosomes, are involved in the degradation of materials engulfed from the intervillous space.</div><div class="text" id="p0195">Although many nuclei are dispersed within the syncytioplasm, other are aggregated into specializations referred to as syncytial knots and syncytial sprouts (<a href="#bib27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Burton et al 2003</a>). Syncytial sprouts are markers of trophoblast proliferation. In the immature placenta, they represent the first stages in the development of new villi that later become invaded by cytotrophoblast and villous mesenchyme (<a href="#bib42" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_42">Fogarty et al 2013</a>). Occasionally, adjacent syncytial sprouts make contact and fuse to form slender syncytial bridges. The sprouts may become detached, forming maternal syncytial emboli that pass to the lungs. It has been computed that some 100,000 sprouts pass daily into the maternal circulation; deported trophoblast may be a mechanism by which the maternal immune system is maintained in a state of tolerance towards paternal antigens (<a href="#bib35" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_35">Chamley et al 2011</a>). In the lungs, syncytial sprouts provoke little local reaction and apparently disappear by lysis. However, they may occasionally form foci for neoplastic growth. Syncytial sprouts are present in the term placenta. By contrast, syncytial knots are aggregates of nuclei with particularly condensed heterochromatin, and may represent a sequestration phenomenon by which senescent nuclear material is removed from adjacent metabolically active areas of syncytium.</div><div class="text" id="p8050">Fibrinoid deposits are frequently found on the villous surface in areas lacking syncytiotrophoblast.

Early mesenchymal cells differentiate initially into small reticulum cells and then into fibroblasts or large reticulum cells.

Mesenchymal collagen increases from a network of fine fibres in early mesenchymal villi to a densely fibrous stroma within stem villi in the second and third trimesters. After approximately postmenstrual week 14, the stromal channels found in immature intermediate villi are infilled by collagen to give the fibrous stroma characteristic of the stem villus.</div><div class="text" id="p0210">Fetal placental vessels include arterioles and capillaries but no lymphatic vessels.

Simple diffusion suffices to explain gaseous exchange. Transfer of ions and other water-soluble solutes is by paracellular and transcellular diffusion and transport. The relative importance of each of these for most individual solutes is unknown, and the paracellular pathway is morphologically undefined. Glucose transfer involves facilitated diffusion, while active transport mechanisms carry calcium ions and at least some amino acids. The fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins are likely to pass across the placental barrier with differing degrees of facility (<a href="#bib56" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_56">Jauniaux and Gulbis 2000a</a>, <a href="#bib62" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_62">Jauniaux et al 2004</a>, <a href="#bib63" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_63">Jauniaux et al 2005</a>).

The passage of maternal antibodies (immunoglobulins) across the placental barrier in late pregnancy confers some degree of passive immunity on the fetus; it is widely accepted that transfer is by micropinocytosis. Investigation of transplacental mechanisms is complicated by the fact that the trophoblast itself is the site of synthesis and storage of certain substances, e.g. glycogen.</div><div class="text" id="p0225">The placenta is an important endocrine organ. Some steroid hormones, various oestrogens, β-endorphins, progesterone, hCG and human chorionic somato-mammotropin (hCS), also known as placental lactogen (hPL), are synthesized and secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast. The trophoblast contains enzyme systems that are associated with the synthesis of steroid hormones, as well as enzymes that inactivate maternal hormones, allowing the fetus to develop and mature in a protected environment; for example, the fetus is protected from 10 times higher maternal glucocorticoid levels by the placental enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11beta-HSD2), that converts biologically active maternal cortisol to inactive cortisone (<a href="#bib69" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_69">Murphy et al 1974</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0230">It has been suggested that leukocytes may migrate from the maternal blood through the placental barrier into the fetal capillaries.

The amniotic membrane extends along the connecting stalk and forms the outer covering of the umbilical cord. After birth, the site of this embryonic/extraembryonic junction is important because the extraembryonic cell lines will die, causing the umbilical cord to degenerate and detach from the body wall. In cases of anomalous development of the ventral body wall, e.g. gastroschisis and exomphalos, the reflections of the amnion along the forming umbilical cord may be incomplete (see below).</div><div class="text" id="p0295">The inner surface of the amnion consists of a simple cuboidal epithelium.

There are no tight junctional complexes between adjacent cells and cationic dyes penetrate between the cells as far as the basal lamina. The intercellular clefts present scattered desmosomes, but elsewhere the clefts widen and contain interlacing microvilli. These features are all consistent with selective permeability properties.

They can be distinguished from the epiblast cells from postfertilization day 8.

Cultured human amniotic epithelial cells express a range of neural and glial markers, including glial fibrillary acidic protein, myelin basic protein, vimentin and neurofilament proteins, suggesting that these cells may supply neurotrophic factors to the amniotic fluid.

A deficiency of amniotic fluid is termed oligohydramnios and absent amniotic fluid is anhydramnios. Oligohydramnios in the second or third trimester is usually the result of urinary tract malformations, e.g. bilateral renal agenesis or obstruction of the lower urinary tract, uteroplacental insufficiency or premature rupture of the membranes. The urachus may play a critical role in the resolution of oligohydramnios in lower urinary tract obstruction by acting as a fistula between the bladder and the amniotic space.

Techniques for biochemical analysis have compared amniotic fluid, fetal umbilical cord blood and maternal serum. Early in development, amniotic fluid resembles blood plasma, but also demonstrates extremely low oxygen tension, reflecting the physiological placental hypoxia noted in the first trimester (<a href="#bib61" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Jauniaux et al 2003</a>, <a href="#bib72" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Ross and Beall 2014</a>).

It contains two tubes of hypoblastic origin, the vitelline-intestinal and allantoic ducts, and their associated vitelline and allantoic (umbilical) blood vessels. The yolk stalk and continuing duct extend the length of the cord, whereas the allantoic duct extends only into its proximal part. The embryonic development of the umbilical cord is considered further in <a href="../B9780702077050000215/B9780702077050000215.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>.</div><div class="text" id="p0365">The mesenchymal core is derived from the somatopleuric extraembryonic mesenchyme covering the amniotic folds; splanchnopleuric extraembryonic mesenchyme of the yolk stalk (which carries the vitelline vessels and clothes the yolk duct); and similar allantoic mesenchyme of the connecting stalk (which clothes the allantoic duct and initially carries two umbilical arteries and two umbilical veins). These various mesenchymal compartments fuse and are gradually transformed into the loose connective tissue (Wharton's jelly) that characterizes the more mature cord. The tissue consists of widely spaced elongated fibroblasts separated by a delicate three-dimensional meshwork of fine collagen fibres that contains a variety of hydrated glycosaminoglycans and is particularly rich in hyaluronic acid.</div><div class="text" id="p0370">The initially symmetric vitelline and allantoic (umbilical) vessels become modified as a result of changes in the intraembryonic circulation. The vitelline vessels involute, whereas most of the allantoic (umbilical) vessels persist. The right umbilical vein disappears but the two umbilical arteries normally remain. In around 1% of pregnancies, one of the umbilical arteries may not develop or disappears at the end of the first trimester. This anomaly is often found in syndromes such as aneuploidies, acardiac fetuses or sirenomelia and when isolated can be associated with slow fetal growth. The vessels of the umbilical cord are rarely straight and are usually twisted into either a right- or left-handed cylindrical helix. The number of turns involved ranges from a few to over 300. This conformation may be produced by unequal growth of the vessels, or by torsional forces imposed by fetal <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="187" id="pagebreak_187"/>movements. Its functional significance is obscure: the pulsations and contractions of the helical vessels may assist the venous return to the fetus in the umbilical vein. Autonomic nerves accompanying the arteries from the pelvic plexus do not penetrate more than a third of the length of the umbilical cord.</div><div class="text" id="p0375">Anomalies of the fetal anterior abdominal wall, such as exomphalos and gastroschisis can affect the arrangement of the outer covering of amnion cells along the proximal end of the umbilical cord (<a href="../B9780702077050000215/B9780702077050000215.xhtml">Ch. 21</a>). Exomphalos arises from a failure of the lateral folds along the ventral surface of the embryo, so that the normal embryonic regression of the midgut from the umbilical stalk into the abdominal cavity fails. The abdominal contents, including intestines and liver or spleen, covered by a sac of parietal peritoneum and amnion, protrude into the base of the umbilical cord. In gastroschisis, the insertion of the umbilical cord is intact and there is evisceration of the intestine through a small abdominal wall defect that is usually located to the right of the umbilical cord, resulting in free loops of bowel in the amniotic cavity.</div><div class="text" id="p0380">Mature umbilical vessels, particularly the arteries, have a strong muscular coat that contracts readily in response to mechanical stimuli. The outermost bundles pursue an interlacing spiral course, and when they contract, they produce shortening of the vessel and thickening of the media, with folding of the interna and considerable narrowing of the lumen. This action may account for the periodic sharp constrictions of contour, the valves of Hoboken, that often characterize these vessels.</div><div class="text" id="p0385">The fully developed umbilical cord is, on average, some 50<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm long and 1–2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm in diameter.

These anomalies probably reflect alterations in the interactions between the blastocyst and the decidua that normally occur in spontaneous pregnancies (<a href="#bib59" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_59">Jauniaux et al 1990</a>). Damage to the uterine wall following surgery, mainly after repeat caesarean section, increases the chances of implantation in the scar area and results in a higher incidence of scar pregnancy and placenta previa accreta in subsequent pregnancies (<a href="#bib65" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Jauniaux et al 2018</a>).</div></section></section><footer><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebib0010"/><h2 class="reftitle" id="s1010">References</h2><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebibsec0010"/><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib15"><!--<a hreef="#bib_15">15</a>. --><a id="ref1010"/><a href="#bib_15">Beall</a> M.H, van den Wijngaard J.P.H.M, van Gemert M.J.C, et al. <cite>Amniotic fluid water dynamics</cite>. <cite><i>Placenta</i></cite>. 2007;28:816–823.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib16"><!--<a hreef="#bib_16">16</a>. --><a id="ref1015"/><a href="#bib_16">Beattie</a> R.B, Rich D.A. <cite>Disorders of amniotic fluid, placenta and membranes</cite>. In: Twining P, McHugo J.M, Pilling D.W, eds. <cite><i>Textbook of Fetal Abnormalities</i></cite>. London: Elsevier, Churchill Livingstone; 2007:75–94 Ch 5.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib17"><!--<a hreef="#bib_17">17</a>. --><a id="ref1020"/><a href="#bib_17">Brosens</a> J.J, Salker M.S, Teklenburg G, et al. <cite>Uterine selection of human embryos at implantation</cite>. <cite><i>Sci Rep</i></cite>. 2014;4:3894.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib18"><!--<a hreef="#bib_18">18</a>. --><a id="nspara1010"/><span class="italic">A study showing that developmentally impaired human embryos elicit an endoplasmic stress response in human decidual cells and suggesting that distinct positive and negative mechanisms contribute to active selection of human embryos at implantation.</span></p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib19"><!--<a hreef="#bib_19">19</a>. --><a id="ref1025"/><a href="#bib_19">Burke</a> K.A, Jauniaux E, Burton G.J, et al. <cite>Expression and immunolocalisation of the endocytic receptors megalin and cubilin in the human yolk sac and placenta across gestation</cite>. <cite><i>Placenta</i></cite>. 2013;34:1105–1109.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib20"><!--<a hreef="#bib_20">20</a>. --><a id="ref1030"/><a href="#bib_20">Burton</a> G.J, Fowden A.L. <cite>Review: The placenta and developmental programming: balancing fetal nutrient demands with maternal resource allocation</cite>. <cite><i>Placenta</i></cite>. 2012;33(Suppl) S23–7.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib21"><!--<a hreef="#bib_21">21</a>. --><a id="ref2035"/><a href="#bib_21">Burton</a> G.J, Jauniaux E. <cite>Oxidative stress</cite>. <cite><i>Best Pract Res Clin Obstet Gynaecol</i></cite>. 2011;25:287–299.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib22"><!--<a hreef="#bib_22">22</a>. --><a id="nspara1015"/><span class="italic">A review of the evidence implicates oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of placental related complications of human pregnancy ranging from miscarriage to pre-eclampsia and premature rupture of the membranes.</span></p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib32"><!--<a hreef="#bib_32">32</a>. --><a id="ref1040"/><a href="#bib_32">Burton</a> G.J, Jauniaux E. <cite>The cytotrophoblastic shell and complications of pregnancy</cite>. <cite><i>Placenta</i></cite>. 2017;60:134–139.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib23"><!--<a hreef="#bib_23">23</a>. --><a id="ref1045"/><a href="#bib_23">Burton</a> G.J, Jauniaux E, Watson A.L. <cite>Maternal arterial connections to the placental intervillous space during the first trimester of human pregnancy;
