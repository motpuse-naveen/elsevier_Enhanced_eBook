The foregut extends from the buccopharyngeal membrane to its continuation into the central midgut region via the cranial intestinal portal. The midgut extends between the intestinal portals and, in the early embryo, is in wide communication with the yolk sac. The hindgut extends from the caudal intestinal portal to the cloacal membrane. The cranial end of the foregut, the embryonic pharynx, is intimately associated with head and neck development (<a href="../B9780702077050000173/B9780702077050000173.xhtml">Ch. 17</a>). The portion of foregut that passes dorsal to the pericardial cavity gives rise to the respiratory diverticulum and oesophagus within the thorax (<a href="../B9780702077050000173/B9780702077050000173.xhtml">Chs 17</a> and <a href="../B9780702077050000203/B9780702077050000203.xhtml">20</a>). Caudal to the developing respiratory diaphragm, the enteric gut is conventionally subdivided into three embryological portions: fore-, mid- and hindgut. There are no corresponding fundamental morphological and cytological distinctions between the three parts (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 21.1</span></a>), and so the foregut produces a portion of the duodenum, as does the midgut, and the midgut similarly produces large intestine, as does the hindgut. The differences between the portions of the gut develop as a result of interactions between the three embryonic tissue layers that give rise to the gut: namely, the endodermal inner epithelium, the thick layer of splanchnopleuric mesenchyme and the outer layer of proliferating splanchnopleuric coelomic epithelium.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000215/main.assets/f21-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 21.1</span> Major epithelial populations within the early embryo.

The lamina propria and muscularis mucosa, the connective tissue of the submucosa, the muscularis externa and the future serosal lamina propria are all derived from the splanchnopleuric mesenchyme. The outer splanchnopleuric coelomic epithelium forms the epithelial component of the serosa (peritoneum, a mesothelium). Both epithelia, inner and outer, express cell polarity markers and form specific apical junctional complexes; they are highly proliferative and appear histologically as pseudostratified epithelia with interkinetic nuclear migration matching the timing of the cell cycle. In the endodermal layer, this proliferation results in lengthening of the inner endodermal epithelium. In the splanchnic coelomic epithelium, which acts as a barrier throughout development to contain locally secreted morphogens, proliferation not only increases the surface area and gives rise to the subjacent mesenchymal population, but also generates biomechanical tension across the whole composite tube, which by differentiative temporo-spatial patterning contributes to regional gut development (<a href="#bib35" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_35">Grosse et al 2011</a>, <a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">Guo et al 2014</a>, <a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Ariza et al 2016</a>, <a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Chevalier et al 2018</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0020">Throughout the gut, blood vessels, lymphatics and lymph nodes develop from local populations of angiogenic mesenchyme.

Although all these factors pertain to the whole range of developing tissues, local differences in any one of these factors along the length of the developing gut promote the differentiation of, for example, the gastric mucosa and hepatocytes; the rotation of the midgut; and the final disposition of the sessile portions of the fully formed gastrointestinal tract. The Hedgehog (Hh) ligands, Shh, Ihh and Dhh, are expressed in the developing gut: Shh and Ihh in the endodermal epithelium and Dhh in endothelial cells. These ligands bind to the Patched receptors (Ptch-1 and Ptch-2), which activate the transcription factor Gli3. Knockout of Shh and Ihh has been associated with oesophageal atresia, gut malrotation, decreased development of the muscularis propria, enteric neurone anomalies and imperforate anus (<a href="#bib56" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_56">Kolterud et al 2009</a>).

It elongates during successive stages and its absolute length increases more rapidly than the embryo as a whole. By stage 15 it is surrounded by splanchnopleuric mesenchyme derived from the walls of the pericardioperitoneal canals. Cranially, it is dorsal to the developing trachea and the two tubes share the mesenchymal population between them; more caudally it is medial to the developing lung buds (<a href="#f0020">Fig. 21.3</a>). The terminal, pregastric segment of the oesophagus is surrounded ventrally by the most cranial part of the septum transversum mesenchyme and dorsally by splanchopleuric mesenchyme, which forms a short, thick, dorsal meso-oesophagus with the lower medial walls of the pericardioperitoneal canals. Caudally these mesenchymal populations are continuous with their respective primitive dorsal and ventral mesogastria. Although the oesophagus has only limited areas related to a primary coelomic epithelium at its caudal end, it is important to note the subsequent development of the para-oesophageal right <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="324" id="pagebreak_324"/><a id="pg324"/>and left pneumatoenteric recesses (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 21.7</a>), the relation of the ventral aspect of the middle third of the oesophagus to the oblique sinus of the pericardium, and the relation of its lateral walls in the lower thorax to the mediastinal pleura. All the foregoing are secondary extensions from the primary coelom.</div><div class="text" id="p0040">The oesophageal mucosa consists of two layers of cells by stage 15, but the proliferation of the mucosa does not occlude the lumen at any time. The mucosa becomes ciliated at 10 postfertilization weeks, and stratified squamous epithelium is present after postmenstrual week 20; occasionally, patches of ciliated epithelium may be present at birth. Circular muscle can be seen at stage 15 but longitudinal muscle has not been identified until stage 21. Neuroblasts can be demonstrated in the early stages; the myenteric plexuses have cholinesterase activity by 9.5 postfertilization weeks and ganglion cells are differentiated by 13 postfertilization weeks. It has been suggested that the oesophagus is capable of peristalsis in the first trimester. Pharyngeal phase swallowing activity has been identified from 11 postmenstrual weeks on ultrasound examination; oesophageal motor function is well developed by 26 postmenstrual weeks (<a href="#bib69" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_69">Neu 2012</a>, <a href="#bib50" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_50">Jadcherla et al 2015</a>).

It starts and ends one to two vertebrae, respectively, higher than in the adult, extending from between the fourth to the sixth cervical vertebra to the level of the ninth thoracic vertebra (see <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0120">Fig. 23.15</a>). Its average diameter is 5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm and it possesses the constrictions seen in the adult. The narrowest constriction is at its junction with the pharynx, where the inferior pharyngeal constrictor functions to constrict the lumen; this region may be easily traumatized with instruments or catheters. In the neonate, the mucosa may contain scattered areas of ciliated columnar epithelium but these disappear soon after birth. Complex swallowing and oesophageal reflexes are present in the full-term neonate (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml">Ch. 14</a>). A coordinated relaxation of the upper oesophageal sphincter is followed sequentially by oesophageal peristalsis and relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter (<a href="#bib48" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_48">Jadcherla 2016</a>). Air or liquid can be distinguished in the oesophagus and result in different swallowing patterns. Maturational changes are seen in the lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation reflex in the postnatal development of preterm infants (<a href="#bib50" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Jadcherla et al 2015</a>). In term and preterm infants, transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations, unrelated to swallowing, permit gastro-oesophageal reflux resulting in frequent regurgitation of food in the newborn period, with a peak prevalence at 4 postnatal months, declining thereafter (<a href="#bib69" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Neu 2012</a>).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0035">Stomach</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0050">The stomach can be recognized, at stage 13, as a fusiform dilation cranial to the wide opening of the midgut into the yolk sac (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 21.3</a>). By stage 14 this opening has narrowed into a tubular vitelline intestinal duct, which will lose its connection with the digestive tube. At this time, the stomach is median in position and separated cranially from the pericardium by the septum transversum (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 21.5A</a>), which extends caudally on to the cranial side of the vitelline intestinal duct and ventrally to the somatopleure. Dorsally, the stomach is related to the aorta and connected to the body wall by a short dorsal mesentery, the dorsal mesogastrium, formed by the medial walls of the pleuroperitoneal canals and intervening splanchnopleuric mesenchyme (see <a href="#f0030">Figs 21.5B</a>, <a href="#f0035">21.6</a>). The latter is directly continuous with the dorsal mesentery (mesenteron) of almost all of the remainder of the intestine, except its caudal short segment.</div><div class="text" id="p0055">The characteristic gastric curvatures are already recognizable in human embryos during stages 15–16. Growth is more active along the dorsal border of the viscus; its convexity markedly increases and the rudimentary fundus appears. Because of more rapid growth along the dorsal border, the pyloric end of the stomach turns ventrally and the concave lesser curvature becomes apparent (see <a href="#f0020">Figs 21.3</a>, <a href="#f0035">21.6</a>). The stomach is now displaced to the left of the median plane and becomes physically rotated, such that its original right surface becomes dorsal and its left surface becomes ventral. Accordingly, the right vagus nerve is distributed mainly to the dorsal, and the left vagus mainly to the ventral, surfaces of the stomach. The dorsal mesogastrium increases in depth and becomes folded on itself. The ventral mesogastrium becomes more coronal than sagittal. The pancreaticoenteric recess (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 21.7B(ii)</a>), until this point conventionally described as a simple depression on the right side of the dorsal mesogastrium, becomes dorsal to the stomach and excavates downwards and to the left between the folded layers: it may now be termed the inferior recess of the bursa omentalis. To summarize, the stomach has undergone relative morphological movements, traditionally referred to as two ‘rotations’. The first is 90° clockwise, about a longitudinal axis viewed from the cranial end; the second is 90° clockwise, about a dorsoventral axis viewed ventrally. The displacement, morphological changes and apparent ‘rotation’ of the stomach have been attributed to differential growth changes of the stomach itself; extension of the pancreaticoenteric recess with changes in its mesenchymal walls; and pressure, particularly that exerted by the rapidly growing liver. Whether the ‘rotations’, which are conventionally used to aid understanding, occur only in the axes described is unclear; differential regional growth and some ‘rotation’ in the transverse plane have also been invoked. The angula insura and the cardia of the stomach <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="325" id="pagebreak_325"/><a id="pg325"/>can be seen in stage 18 and the fundus, body and pylorus are evident at stage 20 (<a href="#bib53" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_53">Kaigai et al 2014</a>).</div><section><a id="s0030"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0040">Mucosa</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0060">Mucosal and submucosal development can be seen in postfertilization weeks 8–9. No villi form in the stomach, unlike in the small intestine; instead, glandular pits can be seen in the body and fundus. These develop in the pylorus and cardia by postfertilization weeks 10–11, when parietal cells can be demonstrated. Although the embryo generally matures in a proximo-distal direction, gastric glands form slightly later than villi in the midgut. Murine embryos show a sharp boundary between the mucosal epithelium of the stomach and the first duodenal crypt. It is suggested that repression of the determination of the stomach endodermal epithelium until a later time, when instructive signals from the surrounding mesenchyme specify a glandular rather than villous mucosal fate, could be part of the patterning of the pylorus and the first part of the duodenum (<a href="#bib62" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_62">Li et al 2009</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0065">Chief cells can be identified after postfertilization weeks 12–13, although pepsinogen has not been demonstrated until term (40 postmenstrual weeks). Mucous neck cells actively produce mucus from 16 postmenstrual weeks. Acid secretion has not been demonstrated in the fetal stomach before 32 postmenstrual weeks, however, preterm infants from 26 postmenstrual weeks onwards, are able to secrete acid soon after birth. Intrinsic factor, also from parietal cells, has been detected after postfertilization week 11; it increases during postmenstrual weeks 14–15, at which time the pylorus, which contains more parietal cells than it does in the adult, also contains a relatively larger quantity of intrinsic factor. The significance of the early production of intrinsic factor and the late production of acid by the parietal cells is not known. Gastrin-producing cells have been demonstrated in the antrum between postmenstrual weeks 19 and 20, and gastrin levels have been measured in cord blood and in the plasma at term. Cord serum contains gastrin levels 2–3 times higher than those in maternal serum. Smooth muscle cells of the muscularis mucosae are first visible by 14 postmenstrual weeks and this layer is well defined by 22 postmenstrual weeks.</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0045">Muscularis</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0070">The muscularis externa can initially be seen at 10 postmenstrual weeks, when neural plexuses are developing in the body and fundus.

Gastric emptying is slower in the preterm infant than in the term infant (<a href="#bib49" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_49">Jadcherla and Berseth 2012</a>). In the neonate, the anterior surface of the stomach is generally covered by the left lobe of the liver, which extends nearly as far as the spleen (see <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0110">Fig. 23.14B</a>).

The mucosa and submucosa are relatively thicker than in the adult; however, the muscularis is only moderately developed and peristalsis is not coordinated. At birth, gastric acid secretion is low, which means that gastric pH is high for the first 12 postnatal hours. It falls rapidly with the onset of gastric acid secretion, usually after the first feed. Acid secretion usually remains low for the first 10 postnatal days.

A ventral mesoduodenum, which is continuous cranially with the ventral mesogastrium, is attached only to the foregut portion. Posteriorly, the duodenum has a thick dorsal mesoduodenum, which is continuous with the dorsal mesogastrium cranially and the dorsal mesentery of the midgut caudally. Anteriorly, the extreme caudal edge of the ventral mesentery of the foregut extends on to the short initial segment of the duodenum. The liver arises as a diverticulum from the ventral surface of the duodenum at the foregut–midgut junction, i.e. where the midgut is continuous with the yolk sac wall (the cranial intestinal portal). The ventral pancreatic bud also arises from this diverticulum. The dorsal pancreatic bud evaginates posteriorly into the dorsal mesoduodenum slightly more cranially than the hepatic diverticulum. The rotation, differential growth, and cavitations related to the developing stomach and omenta cause corresponding movements in the duodenum, which forms a loop directed to the right, with its original right side now adjacent to the posterior abdominal wall (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 21.6</a>). This shift is compounded by the migration of the bile duct and ventral pancreatic duct around the duodenal wall. Their origin shifts until it reaches the medial wall of the second part of the fully formed duodenum; the bile duct passes posteriorly to the duodenum and travels in the free edge of the ventral duodenum and ventral mesogastrium. Local adherence of part of the duodenal serosa and the parietal peritoneum result in almost the whole of the duodenum, other than a short initial segment, becoming sessile.</div><section><a id="s0055"/><section><a id="s0060"/><h4 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0065">Foregut anomalies</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0095">Oesophageal atresia is one of the more common obstructive conditions of the alimentary tract and may be indicated by polyhydramnios.

It may be associated with an anular pancreas, which may compress the duodenum externally (20% of duodenal atresia), or with anomalies of the bile duct. In 40–60% of cases, the atresia is complete and pancreatic tissue fills the lumen. The condition can be diagnosed on abdominal X-ray and ultrasound examination, which reveal a typical double bubble appearance, caused by fluid antenatally and air postnatally enlarging the stomach and the proximal duodenum. Polyhydramnios is invariably present and often is the indication for the scan. Duodenal atresia commonly occurs with other developmental defects, e.g. cardiac and skeletal anomalies, and in Down’s syndrome.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0065"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0070">Special glands of the postpharyngeal foregut</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0075">Pancreas</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0070"/><div class="textfl" id="p0100">The pancreas develops from two evaginations of the foregut that fuse to form a single organ.

A ventral pancreatic bud evaginates in close proximity to the liver primordium but cannot be clearly identified until stage 14, when it appears as an evagination of the bile duct itself. At stage 16 differential growth of the wall of the duodenum results in movement of the ventral pancreatic bud and the bile duct to the right side and, ultimately, to a dorsal position. It is not clear whether there is a corresponding shift of mesenchyme during this rotation. However, the ventral pancreatic bud and the bile duct rotate from a position within the ventral mesogastrium (ventral mesoduodenum) to one in the dorsal mesogastrium (dorsal mesoduodenum), which is destined to become fixed on to the posterior abdominal wall. By stage 17 the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds have fused, although the origin of the ventral bud from the bile duct is still obvious. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds has confirmed that the dorsal pancreatic bud forms the anterior part of the head, the body and the tail of the pancreas, and the ventral pancreatic bud forms the posterior part of the head and the posterior part of the uncinate process.

It also provides cell lines for smooth muscle within the pancreas. Angiogenic mesenchyme invades the developing gland to produce blood and lymphatic vessels.

The β cells, producing insulin and amylin, differentiate first, followed by α cells, which produce glucagon. The δ cells, which produce somatostatin, are seen after 30 postmenstrual weeks. The dorsal bud gives rise mostly to α cells, and the ventral bud to most of the pancreatic polypeptide-producing cells. The β cells develop from the duct epithelium throughout development and into the neonatal period.

This specific portion of coelomic epithelium forms tight junctions with adjacent cells and a basement membrane with the underlying mesenchyme, suggesting that it may function as a barrier preventing loss of intrapancreatic morphogens outwards and spread of extrapancreatic morphogens, e.g. from the mesenchyme surrounding the aorta, inwards, maintaining a boundary function between adjacent viscera (<a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Guo et al 2014</a>). This has been demonstrated <span class="italic">in vitro</span> using mouse embryonic tissue. Developing pancreatic and lung buds from which the coelomic epithelium had been removed fused into a single chimeric tissue mass, whereas no fusion occurred if the coelomic epithelium remained intact. When pancreas without coelomic epithelium was co-cultured with pancreas with intact coelomic epithelium, the epithelium engulfed both explants, extending over the entire surface, forming a larger pancreas. This is reminiscent of the process of dorsal and ventral pancreatic bud fusion. Fusion does not occur in co-culture of lung and pancreatic buds, or two pancreatic buds, when they are surrounded by the relevant coelomic epithelia (<a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Guo et al 2014</a>).

The portal and hepatic veins arise together from the vitelline veins. Early in development, the accumulation of mesenchyme around these veins is similar, whereas later mesenchyme increases around the portal veins; this accumulation is a prerequisite for bile duct development. Primitive hepatoblasts surround the portal vein branches and associated mesenchyme, and form a sleeve of cells termed the ductal plate. Individual cells of the ductal plate are termed cholangiocytes.

The usual explanation for this movement is that rotation of the loop can only occur out of the abdominal cavity, however, studies have shown that biomechanical transduction may promote gut lengthening, and suggest that the formation of the complex secondary and tertiary loops are controlled by genetic regulation. Experimental studies in chick embryo have indicated that the mechanical tension transmitted by the lengthening vitelline duct and the arteries passing to it along the dorsal mesentery, drive the proliferation and elongation of the midgut loop.

The embryonic body is slightly helical at this time, so that the caudal portion of the embryo is more likely to be to the right of the head, and the midgut loop is midsagittal, following the helical body axis. The vitelline veins and the vitelline artery are landmarks for the apex of the midgut loop at stage 14, but from stage 16 the remaining proximal part of the artery gives rise to the superior mesenteric artery. The root of this vessel descends from somite level 13 to 19 (from putative thoracic vertebral levels T6 to T12).</div><div class="text" id="p0240">The longest (dorsoventral) portion of the dorsal mesentery is at the level of the yolk stalk: there is less relative lengthening near the caudal end of the duodenum or the cranial half of the colon. When midgut length has increased sufficiently to extend the apex of the loop into the umbilical coelom, the proximal, cranial limb has moved to the right and the distal, caudal limb to the left relative to the midline (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 21.3C</a>). This relative position is approximately maintained <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="330" id="pagebreak_330"/><a id="pg330"/>so long as the protrusion persists, during which time the proximal limb that forms the small intestine elongates even further. It becomes coiled developing secondary loops in a strict spatiotemporal pattern during postfertilization weeks 6–7, and its adjacent mesentery adopts a pleated appearance. Tertiary loops form after the end of postfertilization week 8 when there is an acceleration of the longitudinal growth of this part of the midgut. The origin of the root of the mesentery is initially both median and vertical, while, at its intestinal attachment, it is elongated like a ruffle and folded along a horizontal zone. The distal, colic, part of the loop elongates less rapidly and has no tendency to become coiled. Between stages 16 and 23, the crown–rump length of the embryo increases 3.6 times. The increase in relative length of the gut over this time shows that the duodenum is 3.5 times longer, the large intestinal part of the midgut loop is 8 times longer, and the small intestinal part of the loop 20 times longer (<a href="#bib92" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Ueda et al 2016</a>). By 10 postfertilization weeks the peritoneal cavity has enlarged and the relative size of the liver and mesonephroi is much less. The re-entry of the gut occurs rapidly, the umbilical ring being sufficiently large to permit multiple loops to return, and in a particular sequence. The proximal loop returns first, with the jejunum mainly on the left and the ileum mainly on the right of the subhepatic abdominal cavity. As they re-enter the abdominal cavity, the coils of jejunum and ileum slide inwards over the right aspect of the descending mesocolon, and so displace the putative descending colon to the left. The transverse colon passes superiorly to the origin of the root of the mesentery (<a href="#f0035"><span class="bold">Fig. 21.6</span></a>). The caecum is the last to re-enter and, at first, lies on coils of ileum on the right. Later development of the colon leads to its elongation and to the establishment of the hepatic and splenic flexures.

This concept has recently been challenged. <a href="#bib86" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Soffers et al (2015)</a> and <a href="#bib42" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_42">Hikspoors et al (2019)</a> reviewed the movement of the midgut using computer generated reconstructions of staged human embryos. They found that several factors contribute to the relative movements of the midgut loop: the helical disposition of the early embryonic body; the extreme longitudinal growth of portions of the midgut loop (the small intestine growth is double that of the colon); the descent of the origins of the cranial and caudal limits of the loop together with the origins of the vessels remained in the loop axis. While the midgut is in the umbilical coelom, secondary loops develop (excluding the intra-abdominal duodenojejunal loop) at three places along the midgut (proximal jejunal, distal jejunal and ileocaecum). Tertiary looping also occurs in these sites although with no predictable pattern of distribution. Resolution of the physiological herniation of the midgut, without any growth of the dorsal mesentery, is achieved once the dorsoventral depth of the abdomen increases, by proximodistal sequential movement of the extra-abdominal loops in a ‘slide and stack’ manner. This conclusion was supported by the observation of intermediate stages where only secondary, or secondary and tertiary, loops of small intestine had returned. The distal ileum and caecum enter the abdomen by sliding from the umbilical orifice to the lower-right abdominal cavity.</div></section><section><a id="s0125"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0130">Umbilical cord</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0250">During the embryonic stages the umbilical cord is formed as the amniotic cavity expands and amnion encases the connecting stalk, allantois and embedded umbilical vessels caudally, and the extraembryonic coelom surrounding the vitelline duct and vessels cranially (<a href="../B9780702077050000094/B9780702077050000094.xhtml#f0055">Figs 9.10</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000100/B9780702077050000100.xhtml#f0055">10.10</a>). From stage 14 the umbilical cord occupies all of the ventral body wall between the pericardial bulge and the developing external genitalia, with similar linear dimensions as the heart; by stage 16 it is proportionally smaller than, and distinguishable from the thorax; at stage 23 it forms about one quarter of the ventral abdominal wall. Caudally, there is no infraumbilical region before stage 15; it becomes apparent by 9 postfertilization weeks. Somatic (hypaxial) mesenchyme, that will form the ventral body wall musculature, migrates into the somatopleuric mesenchyme and passes ventrally towards the midline and the lateral borders of the umbilical cord (<a href="#bib68" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_68">Mekonen et al 2015</a>). A portion of the extraembryonic coelom (chorionic cavity), the umbilical coelom, remains in the forming umbilical cord into which the lengthening midgut loop protrudes. The midgut loop returns to the abdominal cavity at about 10 postfertilization weeks, and the umbilical coelom remains in the cord for at least one week longer (<a href="#bib86" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Soffers et al 2015</a>). The following changes to the maturing cord then occur: the vitellointestinal duct and vessels involute; the cranial end of the allantois becomes thinned and its lumen partially obliterated, forming the urachus. The mesenchymal core of the umbilical cord is derived by coalescence of somatopleuric amniotic mesenchyme, splanchnopleuric vitellointestinal (yolk sac) mesenchyme and splanchnopleuric allantoic (connecting stalk) mesenchyme. These various layers become fused and are gradually transformed into the viscid, mucoid, connective tissue (Wharton’s jelly) that characterizes the more mature cord. The changes in the circulatory system result in a large, cranially orientated, left umbilical vein (the right umbilical vein regresses), and two caudally orientated, spirally disposed umbilical arteries (see <a href="../B9780702077050000136/B9780702077050000136.xhtml#f0130">Fig. 13.25</a>). There is a clear distinction between skin, derived from ectoderm and underlying somatopleuric mesenchyme, and the tissues within the umbilical cord. After birth all tissues within the umbilical cord undergo involution and the cord itself will detach from the skin, regardless of its dimensions.</div><section><a id="s0130"/><section><a id="s0135"/><h4 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0135">Anomalies of midgut rotation</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0260">If the midgut loop fails to return to the abdominal cavity at the appropriate time, a number of ventral defects can result. Failure of obliteration of the vitellointestinal duct connecting the midgut to the yolk sac produces Meckel’s diverticulum. This may present as a short segment of vitelline duct attached to the original ventral side of the ileum; it may remain attached to the umbilicus as a fistula; or it may remain as a ligamentous attachment to the umbilicus. The position and configuration of the duodenal loop are of particular importance in children. The normal duodenal loop has a U-shaped configuration. The suspensory ligament of the duodenum (ligament of Treitz) is usually found to the left of the body of the first or second lumbar vertebral body after normal gut rotation; any other position of this ligament may indicate some degree of gut malrotation. On barium studies, the duodenojejunal flexure should, thus, lie to the left of the upper lumbar spine at the level of the pylorus.</div><div class="text" id="p0265">If the caecum has remained in the right upper quadrant, it may become fixed in that position by peritoneal attachments passing to the right, the so-called Ladd’s bands. These may compress the underlying duodenum and give rise to duodenal stenosis. The high positioning of the caecum close to the duodenal jejunal flexure, in some cases, in the midline, is associated with later development of small intestinal volvulus.</div><div class="text" id="p0270">An umbilical hernia occurs when loops of gut protrude into a widened umbilical cord at term. The degree of protuberance may increase when the infant cries, which raises the intra-abdominal pressure; these hernias usually resolve without treatment. Larger anomalies can be detected on routine antenatal ultrasound examination.</div><div class="text" id="p0275">Exomphalos is a ventral wall defect with midline herniation of the gut into the base of the umbilical cord. It is frequently associated with genetic and chromosomal anomalies. Herniated viscera are covered by the visceral peritoneum, and parietal peritoneum lines the amniotic covering of the umbilical cord externally. The omphalocele so formed ranges in size from a large umbilical hernia to a very large mass containing most of the visceral organs. Even after the exomphalos has been repaired, these babies will still have a deficient anterior abdominal wall.</div><div class="text" id="p0280">Gastroschisis is a paraumbilical defect (usually to the right) of the anterior abdominal wall associated with evisceration of the abdominal organs into the amniotic cavity. The organs are not enclosed in membranes which means that gastroschisis can be detected by prenatal ultrasonography and differentiated from exomphalos (see <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0100">Fig. 23.6B</a>).

Gastroschisis is not regarded as a genetic condition, although familial occurrences have been reported. It is not usually associated with other visceral anomalies. A number of proposed mechanisms have been suggested, initially periumbilical ischaemia, caused by vascular compromise of either the umbilical vein or arteries; anomalous development of the somatopleuric mesenchyme of the ventral body wall, similar to that in ectopia cordis and cloacal exstrophy; other scenarios permitting coils of intestine to enter the amniotic cavity, rather than stay in contact only with the extraembryonic coelomic fluid within the chorionic cavity and umbilical coelom, include amniotic membrane rupture, possibly at the base of the umbilical ring (<a href="#bib100" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Wolf 2018</a>). Nearly all cases of gastroschisis are associated with elevated levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, which prior to ultrasound screening was the sole indicator of the condition (<a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Campbell and Copel 2018</a>). Oligohydramnios is a common association.</div><div class="text" id="p0285">Congenital volvulus arises if the midgut loop does not rotate appropriately. A number of types of this condition are identified. Left-sided colon occurs if the midgut loop has not rotated at all; mixed rotation results in the caecum lying inferior to the pylorus; and failure of appropriate attachment of the peritoneum may result in the small intestine being attached at only two points on the posterior abdominal wall. All of these arrangements lead to a risk of volvulus, which may result in necrosis of the gut. The identification of intestinal malrotation can be made by contrast radiography investigation. However, ultrasonography has the advantage of showing the position of the superior mesenteric vein and artery. The vein should lie to the right of the artery. Most cases of volvulus will show inversion of this normal relationship but malrotation can occur with apparently normally related vessels, particularly in malrotation with bowel obstruction due to Ladd’s bands and not volvulus.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0140"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0140">Maturation of the small intestine</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0145">Mucosa</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0145"/><div class="textfl" id="p0290">The exact timing of the cellular morphogenesis of the gut is difficult to establish, especially as it undergoes a proximodistal gradient in maturation. Developmental differences between parts of the small intestine or colon have not yet been correlated with age. The endodermal cells of the small intestine proliferate and form pseudostratified layers exhibiting interkinetic nuclear migration with mitotic figures. The formation of villi occurs in a proximodistal progression from the duodenum to the ileocaecal junction in Turing-like pattern formation (<a href="../B9780702077050000112/B9780702077050000112.xhtml">Ch. 11</a>). It is not clear how vilification is eventually suppressed in the future colon.

In the human, blunt projections of the endoderm form in the duodenum and proximal jejunum from postfertilization week 7; these developing villi increase in length until, in the duodenum, the lumen becomes difficult to discern. The concept of occlusion of the lumen and subsequent recanalization, described in many accounts of development, is not supported by the cytodifferentiation that occurs in the gut epithelia, challenging the belief that secondary recanalization of the gut lumen occurs (<a href="#bib35" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Grosse et al 2011</a>). By 9 postfertilization weeks, the duodenum, jejunum and proximal ileum have villi, and the remaining distal portion of ileum develops villi by 11 postfertilization weeks. The villi are covered by a simple epithelium. Primitive crypts, epithelial downgrowths into the mesenchyme between the villi, appear during postfertilization weeks 10–12, and similarly follow a craniocaudal progression. Brunner’s glands are present in the duodenum from postmenstrual week 15 and the muscularis mucosa can be seen in the small intestine from postmenstrual week 18.</div><div class="text" id="p0295">Whereas mitotic figures are initially seen throughout the pseudostratified endodermal layer of the small intestine prior to villus formation, by 10–12 postfertilization weeks they are limited to the intervillous regions and the developing crypts. It is believed that an ‘adult’ turnover of cells may exist when rounded-up cells can be observed at the villus tips, in position for exfoliation. The absorptive enterocytes have microvilli at their apical borders before postfertilization week 9. An apical tubular system appears at this time, and is composed of deep invaginations of the apical plasma membrane and membrane-bound vesicles and tubules; many lysosomal elements (meconium corpuscles) appear in the apical cytoplasm. These latter features are more developed in the ileum than jejunum, are most prominent at 16 postmenstrual weeks, and diminish by 21 postmenstrual weeks. There are abundant deposits of glycogen in the fetal epithelial cells, and it has been suggested that, prior to the appearance of hepatic glycogen, the intestinal epithelium serves as a major glycogen store. Goblet cells are present in small numbers by postfertilization week 8, Paneth cells differentiate at the base of the crypts from postfertilization week 11, and enteroendocrine cells appear between postfertilization weeks 9–11.

In the full-term neonate, the small intestine forms an oval-shaped mass with its greater diameter transversely orientated in the abdomen, rather than vertically as in the adult.

However, unlike the respiratory diverticulum of the foregut, the allantois is formed very early in development, prior even to formation of the embryonic endoderm and tail-folding. With <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="333" id="pagebreak_333"/><a id="pg333"/>the reorganization of the caudal region of the embryo at stage 10, part of the allantois is drawn into the body cavity. The early embryonic hindgut thus consists of a dorsal tubular region extending from the caudal intestinal portal to the cloacal membrane, and a ventral blind-ending allantois extending from the cloacal region into the connecting stalk. The slightly dilated cavity, lined by endoderm, that cranially receives the enteric hindgut proper and the root of the allantoenteric diverticulum is termed the endodermal cloaca. It is closed ventrally by the cloacal membrane (endoderm opposed to proctodeal ectoderm), and it also has, transiently, a small recess of endoderm in the root of the tail, the postanal gut. As elsewhere, the hindgut, allantois and endodermal cloaca are encased in splanchnopleuric mesenchyme. Proliferation of the mesenchyme and endoderm in the angle of the junction of hindgut and allantois produces a urorectal septum from stage 15 (see <a href="../B9780702077050000227/B9780702077050000227.xhtml#f0025">Fig. 22.4B</a>). Continued proliferation of the urorectal septum and elongation of the endodermal structures move the endodermal epithelium towards the cloacal membrane, with which it fuses centrally, separating the presumptive rectum and upper anal canal (dorsally) from the presumptive urinary bladder and urogenital sinus (ventrally) (see <a href="../B9780702077050000227/B9780702077050000227.xhtml#f0025">Fig. 22.4C</a>). The cloacal membrane is thus divided into anal (dorsal) and urogenital (ventral) membranes.

A series of longitudinal folds arise initially at the rectum and caecum, and later in the regions of colon between these two points. The folds segment into villi, with new villi forming between. The developing mucosa invaginates into the underlying mesenchyme between the villi to form glands that increase in number by splitting longitudinally from the base upwards. The villi gradually diminish in size and are absent by the time of birth.</div></section><section><a id="s0175"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0175">Maturation of the large intestine</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0340">The similarity of development of the small and large intestines is further mirrored in their cytological differentiation. From 11 postfertilization weeks, dipeptidase activity in the colon as well as in the small intestine is seen. Throughout preterm development, meconium corpuscles are seen in the colon and in the small intestine; they are believed to be the phagocytosed remains of neighbouring cells that have died as a result of programmed cell death. Between 17 and 24 postmenstrual weeks, fetuses express fewer genes in the colon than adults, but like adults, there is a differential expression of genes between ascending and descending colon (<a href="#bib32" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_32">Glebov et al 2003</a>).

At birth, the normal cycle of bile acids is not mature. In the adult, bile is secreted by the liver, stored in the gallbladder and then secreted into the intestine, where it is absorbed by the jejunum and ileum. In the fetus and neonate, the transport of bile acids by an active process from the ileum does not occur, and so bile salts pass on into the colon. In the adult, the presence of bile salts in the colon stimulates the secretion of water and electrolytes, which results in diarrhoeal syndrome; however, the fetal and neonatal colon seems protected from this effect. The colon is not considered a site of significant nutrient absorption in the adult, and yet neonates are unable to assimilate the full lactose load of a normal breast feed from the small intestine and a large proportion of it may be absorbed from the colon. Thus, it appears that the colon fulfils a slightly different role in the preterm and neonatal period, conserving nutrient absorption and minimizing fluid loss until the neonate has adjusted to extrauterine life, oral feeding and the establishment of the symbiotic bacterial flora (see Postnatal development of the gut, <a href="#pg340">p. 340</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0185"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0185">Muscularis</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0350">The muscularis is present and functioning by the eighth postfertilization week, when peristaltic waves have been observed. The specific orientation of the longitudinal muscle layer into taeniae coli occurs in the 11–12 postfertilization weeks, when haustra appear. The enteric nerves are present in Meissner’s and Auerbach’s plexuses at 8 and 12 weeks postfertilization, respectively; there is a craniocaudal migration of neurones into the gut wall. A normal distribution of ganglion cells has been noted in preterm babies of 24 postmenstrual weeks, although there is a region devoid of ganglia just above the anal valves. Anomalous migration of neural crest cells to the gut may give rise to Hirschsprung’s disease (see <a href="#pg334">p. 334</a>). Puborectalis appears in stage 22–23 embryos, following opening of the anal membrane.</div></section><section><a id="s0190"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0190">Serosa</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0355">The development of the serosa of the intestine is considered with the development of the peritoneal cavity (see below).</div></section><section><a id="s0195"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0195">Colon at birth</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0360">In the full-term (notional 40 postmenstrual weeks) neonate, the colon is typically 66<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm long and averages 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm in width. The caecum is relatively smaller than in the adult and it tapers into the vermiform appendix. The ascending colon is shorter in the neonate, reflecting the shorter lumbar region. The transverse colon is relatively long, whereas the descending colon is short, although twice the length of the ascending colon (see <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0110">Fig. 23.14B</a>). The sigmoid colon may be as long as the transverse colon; it often touches the inferior part of the anterior body wall on the left and, in some neonates, part of the sigmoid colon lies in the right iliac fossa. The muscularis, including the taeniae coli, is poorly developed in the colon, as it is in the small intestine. Appendices, epiploicae and haustra are not present, and so the colon has a smooth external appearance: haustra appear within the first 6 months. This means that the small and large intestines cannot be differentiated by standard radiological views.

Mesenchymal proliferation occurs around the rim of the ectodermal aspect of the anal membrane, which thus comes to lie at the bottom of a depression, the proctodeum (see <a href="../B9780702077050000227/B9780702077050000227.xhtml#f0040">Fig. 22.7E</a>). With the absorption and disappearance of the anal membrane, the anorectum communicates with the exterior. The lower part of the anal canal is formed from the proctodeal ectoderm and underlying mesenchyme, but its upper part is lined by endoderm: the line of union corresponds with the edges of the anal valves. The dual origin of the anal canal is reflected in its innervation, in that the endodermal portion is innervated by autonomic nerves, and the ectodermal proctodeum is innervated by spinal nerves. The external anal sphincter has an origin from the myoblasts which migrate into the lower limb and then return to the external genital region (<a href="../B9780702077050000197/B9780702077050000197.xhtml">Chs 19</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000227/B9780702077050000227.xhtml">22</a>) (<a href="#bib94" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_94">Valasek et al 2005</a>).

The condition cannot reliably be diagnosed prenatally by ultrasound diagnosis, and it may be confused with Hirschsprung’s disease (see below) and colonic atresia.

Glial cells associated with the gut have been identified as arising from similar levels. Migrating vagal neural crest cells reach the midgut by postfertilization week 5 and the entire length of the gut is colonized by stages 18–20. Sacral neural crest cells migrate ventrally and invade the gut via the dorsal mesentery (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0170">Fig. 14.6A</a>). It is thought that the vagal and sacral neural crest cells have intrinsic differences in their ability to colonize the gut. The local splanchnopleuric mesenchyme patterns the crest cells, such that those that enter the gut layers attain an enteric fate, whereas those that remain outside the gut become committed as parasympathetic postganglionic neurones. The enteric neurones also migrate to the pancreas. Maturation of the myenteric plexus follows a craniocaudal progression, with enteric neurones differentiating into intrinsic primary afferent neurones, motor neurones and interneurons (<a href="#bib76" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_76">Rao and Gerson 2018</a>). The submucosal plexus arises from centripetally migrating cells from the myenteric plexus 2–3 days later (<a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Burns et al 2009</a>). Interstitial cells of Cajal are derived from splanchnopleuric mesenchymal cells that interact with the wavefront of migrating chains of neural crest cells along the gut. These cells express a proto-oncogene, <span class="italic">c-kit</span>, that can be identified in the gut at the end of the embryonic period along a rostrocaudal gradient. Five subtypes have been identified: the subtype ICC-MP has a pacemaker role throughout the gut, generating and propagating electrical slow waves; subtype ICC-SMP also has a pacemaker role in the colon (<a href="#bib75" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_75">Radenkovic et al 2018</a>).

Histologically, there is either an absence or a reduction in the number of ganglia and postganglionic neurones in the myenteric plexus of the affected segment of gut; postganglionic innervation of the muscle layers is also often defective. It is believed that the condition is caused by a failure of neural crest cells to colonize the gut wall appropriately (<a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_31">Gershon 2010</a>). A variable length of large intestine may be affected; the lower and mid-rectum are the most common sites but, in severe cases, the rectum, sigmoid, descending and even proximal colon can be aganglionic. Occasionally, aganglionosis affects only a very short length of rectum proximal to the anorectal junction and the degree of functional obstruction is minimal; in these cases of ‘ultra-short-segment Hirschsprung’s disease’, clinical anomalies arise later in life. Infants with Hirschsprung’s disease show delay in the passage of meconium, constipation, vomiting and abdominal distension. Culture of enteric nervous system cells derived from patients with Hirschsprung’s disease have been shown to support development of enteric nerves in an aganglionic portion of gut from the same patient, indicating that the colonic tissue is still permissive for enteric neurone development and that postnatal enteric nervous system derived cells are still competent to respond (<a href="#bib80" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_80">Rollo et al 2016</a>).

Initially, the peritoneal cavity associated with the lower end of the foregut has separate right and left components: the pleuroperitoneal canals (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 21.1</a>).

Initially, the intraembryonic coelomic epithelium is a pseudostratified germinal layer from which cellular progeny with different fates arise in specific sites and at specific developmental times. The portion that will give rise to the peritoneum is derived from the lower parts of the pericardioperitoneal canals, and the somatopleure and splanchnopleure associated with the lower foregut, midgut and hindgut to the future rectum (see <a href="#f0010">Figs 21.1</a>, <a href="#f0015">12.2</a>). The proliferative splanchnopleuric epithelium of these regions of coelomic wall produces splanchnic mesenchymal cell populations that form the laminae propriae of the mucosa and submucosa, the smooth muscle in the muscularis of the gut, and the lamina propria and epithelium of the visceral peritoneum (the serosa of the gut wall). The somatopleuric epithelium gives rise to the lamina propria and epithelium of the parietal peritoneum and the underlying body wall adjacent to the ectoderm.</div><div class="text" id="p0420">The coelom wall has not been a topic of specific interest in the past, however, it apparently possesses remarkable characteristics in early development. Its proliferation gives rise to mesenchymal cell populations for all gastrointestinal glands and the connective tissues of the lateral and ventral body walls. At the junction of splanchopleure and somatopleure, it contributes epithelial and mesenchymal populations to the suprarenal glands, the urinary and reproductive tracts, the gonads and the spleen (<a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Ariza et al 2016</a>). Most importantly for gut development, it forms an active barrier in the developing abdomen that maintains the integrity of, and separates, the developing viscera, functions that are continued by the fully developed peritoneum (<a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Guo et al 2014</a>). Its particular role(s) in the development of the respiratory diaphragm and the early expansions of the pleural and peritoneal cavities are as yet uncertain. Above the forming respiratory diaphragm, this putative mesothelial layer is involved in expanding the caudodorsal regions of the pleural cavities, where the somatopleuric mesenchyme of the body wall is excavated dorsal to the developing suprarenal glands, degenerating mesonephric ridges and gonads. Beneath the respiratory diaphragm it drives the development of the upper parts of the forming peritoneal cavity and the transitory formation of peritoneal cul de sacs that pass into the thorax. The most caudal parts of the coelomic wall evaginate bilaterally to create passages for, and the peritoneal coverings of, the testes, as they descend and move out of the abdominal cavity.</div><div class="text" id="p0425">As the gut grows, splanchnic mesenchyme accumulates around the inner endodermal epithelium and the whole unit generally moves ventrally. There is a concomitant enlargement of the caudal ends of the developing pericardioperitoneal (pleuroperitoneal) canals and developing peritoneal cavity adjacent to the midgut. The medial walls of the intraembryonic coelom move closer and there is a relative decrease in the mesenchyme between them. The regions where the medial portions of the intraembryonic coelom come together are termed mesenteries. They are composed of two layers of splanchnopleuric coelom wall with intervening mesenchyme, and contain the neurovascular structures that pass to and from the gut. At the caudal ends of the pleuroperitoneal canals, the gut has both ventral and dorsal mesenteries, whereas, caudal to this, there is only a dorsal mesentery that extends from the third part of the duodenum to the rectum (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 21.6</a>; <a href="#f0040"><span class="bold">Fig. 21.7</span></a>). The arrangement of an (endodermal) epithelial tube, surrounded by splanchnopleuric mesenchyme, enclosed with a further layer of (splanchnopleuric) epithelium, permits the development of differential, regional, biomechanical tension and compressive forces along the gut and mesentery. These biomechanical forces produce a growth pattern termed buckling morphogenesis (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Chevalier et al 2018</a>).

A ventral mesogastrium can be seen when the distance between the stomach and liver increases.</div><section><a id="s0260"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0250">Consequences of rotation of the stomach</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0465">A number of processes occur concurrently, which, conceptually, can be visualized as the movement of the right pleuroperitoneal canal to a position posterior to the stomach, such that its communication with the remainder of the peritoneal cavity is reduced. These processes include the differential growth of the walls of the stomach, the formation and specific local extension of the omenta (dorsal and ventral mesogastria), and the growth of the liver and, particularly, of the vessels and ducts that enter and leave the liver.</div><div class="text" id="p0470">Whereas the dorsal mesogastrium takes origin from the posterior body wall in the midline, its connection to the greater curvature of the stomach, which lengthens as the stomach grows, becomes directed to the left as the stomach undergoes its first rotation. With the second rotation, a portion of the dorsal mesogastrium now faces caudally (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 21.6</a>). The ventral mesogastrium remains as a double layer of coelomic epithelium, which encloses mesenchyme and forms the lesser omentum (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 21.7</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0475">These developments permit stomach expansion both anteriorly and posteriorly when food is ingested, and free movement of peristalsis. The right pleuroperitoneal canal forms a discrete region of the peritoneal cavity, the lesser sac and the remaining left pleuroperitoneal canal and the remainder of the peritoneal cavity form the greater sac. The entrance to the original right pleuroperitoneal canal (lesser sac) becomes reduced in size. It is called the epiploic foramen, foramen of Winslow, or the aditus of the omental bursa (bursa omentalis).</div></section><section><a id="s0265"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0255">Early stages of lesser sac development</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0480">The lesser sac is first indicated by the appearance of multiple clefts in the para-oesophageal mesenchyme on both left and right aspects of the oesophagus. Although they may become confluent, the left clefts are transitory and soon atrophy. The right clefts merge to form the right pneumatoenteric recess that extends from the oesophageal end of the lesser curvature of the stomach as far as the caudal aspect of the right lung bud. At its gastric end, it communicates with the general peritoneal cavity and lies ventrolateral to the gut, while more rostrally it lies directly lateral to the oesophagus. It is not, as commonly stated, a simple progressive excavation of the right side of the dorsal mesogastrium. The right pneumatoenteric recess undergoes further extension, subdivision and modification (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 21.7A(i), B(i)</a>). From its caudal end, a second process of cleft and cavity formation occurs, which produces the hepatoenteric recess. This thins and expands the splanchnopleure between the liver and the stomach and proximal duodenum, and reaches the respiratory diaphragm (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 21.7A(i), C(i)</a>). The resulting mesenteric sheet is the lesser omentum. It is derived, cranially to caudally, from the small meso-oesophagus; the much larger ventral mesogastrium, and the most caudal free border is from the ventral mesoduodenum. As differential growth of the duodenum occurs, the biliary duct is repositioned and the duodenum is sessile. The duodenal attachment of the free border and a continuous neighbouring strip of the lesser omentum become confined to the upper border of a short segment of its superior part. The contrasting growth and positioning of its attached viscera cause the free border to change gradually from the horizontal to the vertical. It carries the bile duct, portal vein and hepatic artery, and its hepatic end is reflected around the porta hepatis. An alternative name for this part of the lesser omentum is the hepatoduodenal ligament; it forms the anterior wall of the epiploic foramen. The floor of the foramen is the initial segment of the superior part of the duodenum, its posterior wall is the peritoneum covering the immediately subhepatic part of the inferior vena cava, and its roof the caudate process of the liver. The major part of the lesser omentum from the lesser gastric curvature passes in an approximately coronal plane to reach the floor of the increasingly deep groove for the ductus venosus on the hepatic dorsum; this part is sometimes called the hepatogastric ligament.</div><section><a id="s0270"/><p class="h6hd" id="cesectitle0260">Ligaments of the liver</p><div class="textfl" id="p0485">The liver appears precociously large during development. Thus, the liver mass projects into the abdominal cavity with equal growth on the two sides of the peritoneal cavity. The ligaments associated with the liver develop from the ventral mesogastrium, which passes from the foregut to the ventral abdominal wall, down to the cranial rim of the intestinal portal, and from the reflections of peritoneum from the liver to the respiratory diaphragm.</div><div class="text" id="p0490">The medial portions of the proliferating coelomic epithelial walls producing splanchnopleuric mesenchyme, plus the septum transversum mesenchyme and developing liver, constitute the early ventral mesogastrium (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 21.5</a>). The mesenchyme between these layers is continuous superiorly with the septum transversum mesenchyme of the future respiratory diaphragm. The coelomic epithelial layers of the ventral mesogastrium almost touch ventrally and dorsally to the liver, and are separated by a slender layer of mesenchyme. They form the falciform ligament and the lesser omentum, respectively, and where <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="337" id="pagebreak_337"/><a id="pg337"/>they are in contact with the liver directly, they form visceral peritoneum (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 21.7D</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0495">When the respiratory diaphragm is formed above the liver (<a href="../B9780702077050000203/B9780702077050000203.xhtml">Ch. 20</a>), local cavities coalesce and open into the general coelomic cavity as extensions of the greater and lesser sacs. In this way, almost all the ventrosuperior, visceral and some of the posterior aspects of the liver become peritonealized. The process of extending the greater sac continues over the right lobe and stops when the future superior and inferior layers of the coronary ligament and the right triangular ligament are defined. Those, plus a medial boundary provided by an extension of the lesser sac, enclose the ‘bare area’ of the liver, where loose areolar tissue of septum transversum origin persists. Later in development, the left lobe becomes relatively smaller than the right, and this presumably accounts for the smaller size of the left triangular ligament.</div><div class="text" id="p0500">Where the superior layers of the coronary and left triangular ligaments meet, they continue as a (trilaminar) ventral mesentery attached to the ventrosuperior aspects of the liver. The somewhat arched umbilicohepatic free caudal border carries the left umbilical vein. As the ventral body wall develops, this falciform ligament, which initially attaches to the early cranial intestinal portal, is drawn to the diminishing cranial rim of the umbilicus. It may be considered as the final ventral part of the ventral mesogastrium, although its free border has a ventral mesoduodenal origin. Its passage to the ventral body wall becomes increasingly oblique, curved and falciform as the umbilicus becomes more defined.</div><div class="text" id="p0505">In the early embryo, the connection between the pericardioperitoneal canals is directly across the ventral surface of the cranial midgut, immediately caudal to the developing primitive ventral mesogastrium (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 21.1</a>). By stage 14 passage from one side of the falciform ligament to the other means passing either below the greatly enlarged liver, or the curved lower edge of the falciform ligament, or the lesser omentum. The position of the falciform ligament is of clinical interest in the neonate in diagnosing pneumoperitoneum because it is silhouetted by air on abdominal X-rays.</div></section><section><a id="s0275"/><p class="h6hd" id="cesectitle0265">Caval fold</p><div class="textfl" id="p0510">The caval fold is a developing linear eminence, protruding from the dorsal wall of the pleuroperitoneal canal, produced bilaterally by morphological changes in the position of the common cardinal veins, the horns of the sinus venosus, and formation of the rostral portions of the vena cava (<a href="../B9780702077050000136/B9780702077050000136.xhtml">Ch. 13</a>). It has divergent rostral and caudal ends. Rostrally, it becomes continuous lateromedially with the root of the developing lung bud and pleural coelom, the uppermost portion of the septum transversum mesenchyme, and the retrocardiac mediastinal mesenchyme. Caudally, it forms an arch with dorsal and ventral horns. The dorsal horn merges with the primitive dorsal mesentery of the developing heart and the mesonephric ridge and associated gonad and suprarenal (adrenal) glands developing on the dorsal walls of the intraembryonic coelom. The ventral horn is confluent with the dorsal surface of the septum transversum mesenchyme.</div><div class="text" id="p0515">Thus, the caval fold is a zone where intestinal, mesenteric, intermediate, hepatic, pericardial, pulmonary and mediastinal mesenchymes meet and blend. It provides a mesenchymal route for the upper abdominal, transdiaphragmatic and transpericardial parts of the inferior vena cava, and it is also prominent in the development of parts of the liver, the lesser sac of peritoneum, and certain mesenteries. The left fold regresses whereas the right fold enlarges rapidly (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 21.7A(i), A(ii)</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0520">The pneumatoenteric recess continues to expand to the right into the substance of the caval fold. It stops near the left margin of the hepatic part of the inferior vena cava, which remains extraperitoneal and crosses the base of the now roughly triangular bare area of the liver and this new expanded line of reflection. With closure of the pleuroperitoneal canals, the rostral part of the right pneumatoenteric recess is sequestered by the respiratory diaphragm but often persists as a small serous sac in the right pulmonary ligament. The remaining caval fold mesenchyme to the left of the inferior vena cava – which forms the right wall of the upper part of the lesser sac – becomes completely invaded by embryonic hepatic tissue and is transformed into the caudate lobe of the liver. This smooth, vertically elongated mass projects into the cavity of the lesser sac; both its posterior and much of its anterior surfaces become peritonealized as a result of the increasing depth of the groove for the ductus venosus and the attachment of the lesser omentum to its floor.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0280"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0270">Later stages of lesser sac development</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0525">The lower (inferior) part of the lesser sac can be first seen in stage 15 embryos; the early pneumatoenteric and hepatoenteric recesses are well established. Progressive differential gastric growth produces an elliptical transverse sectional profile, with a right-sided lesser curvature, which corresponds to the original ventral border of the gastric tube. The lesser omental gastric part of the ventral mesogastrium remains attached to this border. The greater curvature of the stomach is a new, rapidly expanding, region; its convex profile projects mainly to the left, but also cranially and caudally (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 21.7A(i), B(i), C(i)</a>). The original dorsal border of the gastric tube now traverses the dorsal aspect of the expanding rudiment, curving along a line near the lesser curvature. The primitive dorsal mesogastrium is transiently attached to it, and blends with the thick layer of compound gastric mesenchyme clothing the posterior aspect and greater curvature of the miniature stomach. Because of its thickness, the mesenchyme projects rostrally, caudally and, particularly, to the left, beyond the ‘new’ greater curvature of the endodermal lining of the stomach.</div><div class="text" id="p0530">The processes already described in relation to the ventral mesenteries now supervene. Multiple clefts appear at various loci in the mesenchyme, with local mesenchymal to epithelial transition. The groups of clefts rapidly coalesce to form transiently isolated closed spaces, which soon join with each other and with the preformed upper part of the lesser sac; the newly formed epithelia join the coelomic epithelium. In sequence, the initial loci occur in the compound posterior gastric mesenchyme nearer the lesser curvature and along its zone of blending with the primitive dorsal mesogastrium; in the dorsal mesoduodenum; and independently, in the caudal rim, where greater curvature mesenchyme and dorsal mesogastrium blend. As these cavities become confluent and their ‘reniform’ expansion follows, matches and then exceeds that of the gastric greater curvature, there are several major sequelae. The primitive dorsal mesogastrium increases in area by intrinsic growth, and, as cavitation proceeds, by incorporating substantial contributions from the dorsal lamella separated by cleavage of the posterior gastric mesenchyme. It becomes the secondary dorsal mesogastrium and its gastric attachment changes progressively (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 21.7A(ii)</a>). It may be regarded as a set of somewhat spiral lines, longitudinally disposed, that move with time to the left, from near the lesser curvature, towards and finally reaching the definitive greater curvature. The parietal mesogastrial and (cleaving) mesoduodenal attachments remain in the dorsal midline for a time, but they later undergo profound changes. With the confluence of the cavities that collectively form the lower part of the lesser sac, its communication with the upper part (which corresponds to the lesser gastric curvature and right and left gastropancreatic folds) becomes better defined. Ventral to the lower part of the cavity, post-cleavage splanchnopleure covers the posteroinferior surface of the stomach and a short proximal segment of the duodenum. This ventral wall is continued beyond the greater curvature and duodenum as the splanchnopleuric strip of visceral attachment of the secondary dorsal mesogastrium and mesoduodenum. The radial width of the strip is relatively short cranially (gastric fundus) and gradually increases along the descending left part of the greater curvature. It is longest throughout the remaining perimeter of the greater curvature as far as the duodenum; this prominent part shows continued marginal (caudoventral and lateral) growth with extended internal cavitation (its walls constitute the expanding greater omentum; see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 21.6H</a>). The margins of the cavity of the inferior part of the lesser sac are limited by the reflexed edges of the ventrally placed strata derived from the secondary dorsal mesogastrium just described. These converge to form the splanchnopleuric dorsal wall, which is initially ‘free’ throughout, except at its midline dorsal root. At roughly mid-gastric levels, the pancreatic rudiment grows obliquely encased in this dorsal wall; its tail ultimately reaches the left limit of the lesser sac at the level of the junction between gastric fundus and body (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 21.7C(ii)</a>).</div><section><a id="s0285"/><p class="h6hd" id="cesectitle0275">Greater omentum</p><div class="textfl" id="p0535">The greater omentum continues to grow, both laterally and, particularly, caudoventrally. It covers and is closely applied to the transverse mesocolon, transverse colon and inframesocolic and infracolic coils of small intestine (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 21.6D–G</a>). At this stage, the quadrilaminar nature of the dependent part of the greater omentum is most easily appreciated. Mesenteries may be considered trilaminar: they possess two mesothelial surfaces derived from splanchnopleuric coelomic epithelium ‘sandwiching’ splanchnopleuric mesenchyme between them. In the greater omentum, the gastric serosa covering its posteroinferior surface (single mesothelium) and the anterosuperior serosa (single mesothelium) converge to meet at the greater curvature and initial segment of the duodenum, with intervening mesenchyme. The resulting mesentery continues caudoventrally as the ‘descending’ trilaminar stratum of the omentum. This, on reaching the omental margins, is reflexed and now passes craniodorsally to its parietal root as the ‘ascending’ posterior, trilaminar stratum. The descending and ascending layers are, initially, in fairly close contact caudally, but are separated by a fine, fluid-containing, <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="338" id="pagebreak_338"/><a id="pg338"/>cleft-like extension of the lower part of the lesser sac. The posterior mesothelium of the posterior stratum makes equally close contact with the anterosuperior surface of the transverse colon, starting at the taenia omentalis, and with its transverse mesocolon.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0290"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0280">Maturation of the lesser sac</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0540">At this stage, and subsequently, it is convenient to designate the lower part of the lesser sac as consisting of three subregions: retrogastric, perigastric and greater omental (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 21.7C(ii)</a>). The names are self-explanatory but their confines are all modified by various factors. Two phenomena are particularly prominent: namely, gastric ‘descent’ relative to the liver, and adherence of peritoneal layers ultimately giving altered lines of reflection, and loss of parts of cavities.</div><div class="text" id="p0545">After the first trimester, hepatic growth, particularly of the left lobe, diminishes and the whole organ fits into the upper region of the enlarging abdomen. Meanwhile, the stomach elongates and some descent occurs, despite its relatively fixed cranial and caudal ends. This produces the angular flexure of the stomach, that persists postnatally. The concavity of the lesser curvature is now directed more precisely to the right, and the lesser omentum is more exactly coronal and its free border vertical. Ventral to the liver, the free border of the falciform ligament passes steeply craniodorsally from umbilicus to liver (see disposition in the neonate in <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0110">Figs 23.14</a> and <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0120">23.15A, D</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0550">The mesenchymal dorsal wall of the lower part of the lesser sac has, up to this point, retained its original dorsal midline root. The mesenchymal cores of the mesenteries become thinner, and are termed fascial sheaths and septa. Overlying areas of mesentery then adhere to the original dorsal coelomic wall, by ways as yet unknown. Where sheets adhere, they remain surgically separable and no vascular anastomoses develop across the interzone.</div><div class="text" id="p0555">Above the pancreas, the original left leaf of the dorsal mesoduodenum and greater omentum becomes closely applied to the original left dorsal coelomic wall covering the lower parts of the respiratory diaphragm, much of the left suprarenal gland, the ventromedial part of the upper pole of the left kidney, the initial part of the abdominal aorta, the coeliac trunk and its branches, and other vessels, nerves and lymphatics. Their peritoneal surfaces adhere.</div><div class="text" id="p0560">This process is repeated at the level of the developing pancreas which is now extending into the layers of the dorsal mesoduodenum and greater omentum. As the pancreas grows dorsally, and then to the left as the mesenteries themselves move, the whole surface of the pancreas is covered by splanchnopleuric mesenchyme and developing peritoneum, except where peritoneal lines of reflection exist. The left leaf of the dorsal mesoduodenum/greater omentum becomes closely applied and adheres to the left dorsal coelomic wall covering all the posterior abdominal wall structures it crosses, but at a lower level than that described above, i.e. inferior vena cava, abdominal aorta, splenic vein, superior mesenteric vessels, inferior mesenteric vein, portal vein, left renal vessels, the caudal pole of the left suprarenal gland, a broad ventral band on the left kidney and developing muscles of the dorsal abdominal wall (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 21.7A(ii), B(ii), C(ii)</a>). The pancreas is now sessile. The original right leaf of the dorsal mesoduodenum/greater omentum becomes the peritoneum covering the upper left part of its head, neck and the anterosuperior part of the pancreatic body forms the central part of the dorsal wall of the lesser sac. The pancreatic tail remains peritonealized by a persisting part of the secondary dorsal mesogastrium as it curves from the ventral aspect of the left kidney towards the hilum of the spleen. The infracolic parts of the pancreas are covered with greater sac peritoneum. In the greater omental subregion of the lower part of the lesser sac, two contrasting forms of mesenteric adhesion occur. The posterior ‘returning’ stratum of the omentum undergoes partial adhesion with the peritoneum of the transverse colon at the taenia omentalis and with its mesocolon. The layers remain surgically separable; no anastomosis occurs between omental and colic vessels.</div><div class="text" id="p0565">The original dorsal midline attachment of the foregut dorsal mesentery is profoundly altered during the development of the lesser sac and its associated viscera. However, despite the extensive areas of adhesion, virtually the whole of the gastric greater curvature (other than a small suboesophageal area) and its topographical continuation (the inferior border of the first 2–3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm of the duodenum) retain true mesenteric derivatives of the secondary dorsal mesogastrium and its continuation, the dorsal mesoduodenum. Although regional names are used to assist identification and description, it is important to emphasize that they are all merely subregions of one continuous sheet.</div><div class="text" id="p0570">The upper (oesophagophrenic) part of the lesser omentum arches across the respiratory diaphragm. As this mesentery approaches the oesophageal hiatus, its epithelial laminae diverge, skirting the margins of the hiatus. They then descend for a limited distance and with variable inclination, to enclose reciprocally shaped areas on the dorsum of the gastric fundus and respiratory diaphragm. The area may be roughly triangular to quadrangular. It contains mesenchyme that becomes areolar tissue, and constitutes the bare area of the stomach or, when large, the left extraperitoneal space. Its right lower angle is the base of the left gastropancreatic fold, and its left lower angle reconstitutes the mesentery. The root of the latter arches downwards and to the left across the respiratory diaphragm and suprarenal gland, and gives the gastrophrenic ligament to the gastric fundus. It continues to arch across the ventral surface of the upper part of the left kidney, and its layers part to receive the pancreatic tail; they initially extend to the hilum of the spleen as the splenorenal ligament (see <a href="#f0035">Figs 21.6C</a>, <a href="#f0040">21.7D</a>). The left half of this trilaminar ‘ligament’ provides an almost complete mesenchymal and peritoneal tunic for the developing spleen. It then reunites with its fellow at the opposite rim of the splenic hilum, and continues to the next part of the gastric greater curvature as the gastrosplenic ligament. The remaining part (perhaps two-thirds) of the gastric greater curvature and its short duodenal extension provide attachment for the anterior, ‘descending’, stratum of the greater omentum. Its returning, posterior, stratum continues to its parietal root (which extends from the inferior limit assigned to the splenorenal ligament), and curves caudally and to the right along the anterior border of the body of the pancreas, immediately cranial to the line of attachment of the transverse mesocolon. Crossing the neck of the pancreas, the same curve is followed for a few centimetres on to its head, the omental root then sharply recurves cranially and to the left, to reach the inferior border of the duodenum. Thus it reaches that part of the lesser sac provided by cleavage of the dorsal mesoduodenum from the greater sac. It enters the epiploic foramen, traverses the epiploic canal between the caudate hepatic process and proximal duodenum, then crosses the right gastropancreatic fold, and descends behind the proximal duodenum to enter the right marginal strip enclosed by the greater omentum.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0295"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0285">Peritoneum associated with the midgut loop and hindgut</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0575">The midgut and hindgut have no ventral mesentery; thus, the early pleural and supra-umbilical peritoneal cavities are, initially and transiently, bilaterally symmetric above the umbilicus. Below the umbilicus, the peritoneal cavity is freely continuous across the midline ventral to the gut (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 21.5A</a>). It is convenient to consider the mesenteries of the small and large intestine after rotation when the principal growth patterns have been achieved, and the developing pancreas is sessile. Studies of the adult parietal peritoneum, driven by surgical resection of the mesocolon, have led to the view that apposed layers of developing peritoneum adhere in some manner rather than involute dorsally, and that the final differentiation of the dorsal mesentery is of an organ in its own right, continuous from the duodenojejunal flexure to the mesorectum, as it is in the embryo (<a href="#bib27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Dodds et al 1986</a>, <a href="#bib83" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_83">Sehgal and Coffey 2014</a>, <a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Byrnes et al 2019</a>).

Communication between intermesenteric and the original retroperitoneal mesenchyme is via aortic and caval vessels which supply both regions. Histological examination of regions of mesenteric adhesion has shown, as predicted by Toldt in the nineteenth century, that the original (visceral) left side of the mesentery is joined to the dorsal parietal coelomic wall with a layer termed Toldt’s fascia intervening (<a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Coffey et al 2016</a>).

However, it does explain the many previously described retroperitoneal planes. The compartments of the retroperitoneum and the final position of the dorsal mesentery of the midgut in the infracolic compartments and the regions of adult parietal peritoneal reflection, are described in <a href="../B9780702077050000616/B9780702077050000616.xhtml">Chapters 61</a> and <a href="../B9780702077050000628/B9780702077050000628.xhtml">62</a>. In the infracolic regions, three original layers of coelomic wall form the peritoneum medial to the ascending and descending colon: the original right and left dorsal coelomic walls and both layers of the mesocolon after its rotation and final disposition.

The layers over the lower parts of the duodenum are more complex.

These regions of the gut undergo long periods of growth, often asymmetric, and their final positions, dimensions and general topography show considerable variation. The vermiform appendix is almost wholly clothed with visceral peritoneum, derived from the diverging layers of its rather diminutive mesoappendix. The latter should perhaps be regarded as a direct derivative of the primitive dorsal mesentery, and a similar status for the vascular fold of the caecum should be considered.</div><div class="text" id="p0605">The colonic gut retains its primitive dorsal mesentery, the mesocolon, until the differential growth, rotation and circumabdominal displacement of this part of the gut nears completion. Its original root is still vertical in the dorsal midline, although the mesocolon diverges from it widely as an incomplete, flattened pyramid, to reach its colonic border at the future taenia mesocolica. During postmenstrual weeks 16–20, substantial areas of the primitive mesocolon adhere to the dorsal coelomic wall. In this way, some colonic segments become sessile while others have a shorter mesocolon with an often profoundly altered parietal line of attachment. The mesocolon of the transverse and sigmoid segments normally persists, while the ascending colon, right (hepatic) flexure and descending colon become sessile; the ascending or descending, or both, colonic segments may also retain a mesocolon, which varies from a localized ‘fold’ to a complete mesocolon. When sessile, the ventral, medial and lateral aspects of the ascending or descending colon are clothed with peritoneum, and the protrusion of the viscus produces medial and lateral peritoneal paracolic gutters on each side. This form of apposition to underlying structures proceeds from the ascending colon to include the right colic (hepatic) flexure, and from there it continues ventro-inferiorly to the left, so involving the right-sided initial segment of the transverse colon.</div></section><section><a id="s0315"/><p class="h6hd" id="cesectitle0300">Transverse colon</p><div class="textfl" id="p0610">The right extremity of the transverse colon is sessile, and is separated by fibro-areolar tissue from the ventral aspect of the descending (second) part of the duodenum and the corresponding aspect of most of the head of the pancreas. The remainder of the transverse colon, up to and including the left (splenic) colic flexure, is almost completely peritonealized by the diverging layers of the transverse mesocolon. The root of the latter reaches the neck and whole extent of the ventral border of the body of the pancreas. The long axis of the definitive pancreas lies obliquely. The splenic colonic flexure is considerably more rostral than the hepatic flexure and, consequently, the root of the mesocolon curves obliquely upwards as it crosses the upper abdomen from right to left. As it expands, the posteroinferior (descending) wall of the greater omental part of the lesser sac gradually covers, and then adheres to the transverse mesocolon and its contained colon, finally projecting beyond the latter. Craniocaudal adhesion now occurs between the omental wall and the pericolonic and mesocolonic layers.</div></section><section><a id="s0320"/><p class="h6hd" id="cesectitle0305">Descending colon</p><div class="textfl" id="p0615">The left colic flexure receives much of its peritoneal covering from the left extremity of the transverse mesocolon. It is also often connected to the parietal peritoneum of the respiratory diaphragm over the 10th and 11th ribs by a phrenicocolic ligament. The latter sometimes blends with a presplenic fold that radiates from the gastrosplenic ligament. The descending colon becomes sessile.

The urorectal septum, a localized region of proliferating coelomic epithelium and underlying mesenchyme grows caudally towards the cloacal membrane, and concomitantly enlarges the intraembryonic coelom in a caudal direction (see <a href="#f0010">Figs 21.1</a>, <a href="#f0025">22.4</a>). By stage 15 the cloaca is divided into enteric hindgut and urogenital sinus, and the cloacal membrane is divided into urogenital and anal parts (<a href="../B9780702077050000227/B9780702077050000227.xhtml">Ch. 22</a>). Urorectal septal growth generates different populations of splanchnopleuric mesenchyme that contribute to the lower portions of the enteric hindgut and urethra. The overlying coelomic epithelium covers the dorsal and ventral borders of an extending peritoneal pouch until, at stages 18–20, the caudal region, where these layers are confluent, approaches mesenchyme surrounding the developing levator ani muscle. After this time the lower part of the pouch is found just caudal to the insertion of the mesonephric ducts into the urogenital sinus; segmental levels 31–32 (S2–S3). Between stages 20–23, mesenchymal proliferation increases above the levator ani muscle, and from about 11 postmenstrual weeks onwards the deepest point of the prerectal peritoneal pouch is located in the plane through S3 and the symphysis pubis (<a href="#bib58" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Kruepunga et al 2018</a>).

It is likely that the patterning of the uroseptum mesenchyme is complex; this cell population is involved in interactions with ectodermal and endodermal epithelia, and the development of the external genitalia and external sphincters, which derive from the ventral muscle mass which initially migrates into the lower limb and then returns to the perineal region (<a href="#bib94" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Valasek et al 2005</a>).

Postnatally, a slow but progressive adhesion of the internal surfaces occurs, with obliteration of the most dependent part of the cavity; this proceeds rostrally and, when mature, the cavity does not usually extend appreciably beyond the transverse colon. Adhesion between the posterior leaf of the greater omentum and the originally right, but now cranial leaf of the transverse mesocolon, is completed when the transverse colon attains its final position.</div><div class="text" id="p0650">In the neonate, the peritoneal cavity is ovoid and fairly shallow from anterior to posterior, because the bilateral posterior extensions on each side of the vertebral column, which are prominent in the adult, are not present. Two factors lead to the protuberance of the anterior abdominal wall in the neonate and infant. The respiratory diaphragm is flatter in the newborn, which produces a caudal displacement of the viscera. The pelvic cavity is very small in the neonate, which means that organs that are normally pelvic in the adult, i.e. urinary bladder, ovaries and uterus, all extend superiorly into the abdomen (see <a href="../B9780702077050000227/B9780702077050000227.xhtml#f0050">Figs 22.9</a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000227/B9780702077050000227.xhtml#f0055">22.10</a>).

However, the greater omentum is relatively small; its constituent layers of peritoneum may not be completely adherent, and it does not extend much below the level of the umbilicus. Generally, the relative length of the mesentery of the small intestine and of the transverse and sigmoid mesocolons is greater than in the adult, whereas the area of adherence of the ascending and descending colons is relatively smaller.

It appears during stages 15–17 as a localized thickening of the coelomic epithelium of the dorsal mesogastrium near its cranial end (see <a href="#f0035">Figs 21.6</a>–<a href="#f0040">21.7</a>). The proliferating cells invade the underlying angiogenic mesenchyme, which becomes condensed and vascularized. The process occurs simultaneously in several adjoining areas, that soon fuse to form a lobulated spleen of dual origin, i.e. from dorsal mesogastrium mesenchyme derived from the coelomic epithelium and from angiogenic mesenchyme derived from developing mesenteric blood vessels. Experimental studies in mouse embryos suggest that neural crest cells also invade the spleen via the splenic vessels and give rise to astrocyte-like glial cell populations (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Barlow-Anacker et al 2017</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0665">The splenic vascular reticulum is well developed by the end of stage 23 and contains numerous closely spaced, thin-walled, vascular loops and immature reticulocytes. From about 11 postfertilization weeks, the development of the spleen has been described in four stages: stage 0 has erythrocyte precursors, few macrophages and fewer lymphocytes; in stage I, lymphocytes begin colonization and arterial vascular lobules are seen; in stage II, T and B lymphocytes form periarteriolar clusters with B cells aggregated around the peripheral branches of splenic arterioles and T cells centrally; in stage III, before birth, the lobular arrangement is no longer discernible (<a href="#bib88" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_88">Steiniger et al 2007</a>).

These increase in number and form a reticular framework from 20–23 postmenstrual weeks, when a primitive white pulp can be observed around arterioles. By 24 postmenstrual weeks, T and B lymphocytes become segregated; T cells are found within the SMA-positive reticular framework, and B cells aggregate close to the periarticular lymphoid sheath, where they form lymphoid follicles (<a href="#bib82" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_82">Satoh et al 2009</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0675">Changes to the position of the developing spleen are driven by the expansion of the right pleuroperitoneal canal to the left, and the consequent lengthening of the dorsal mesogastrium and its movements caused by stomach rotation. The dorsal mesogastrium becomes the splenorenal ligament (from the dorsal abdominal wall to the spleen) and the gastrosplenic ligament (from the spleen to the stomach) (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 21.6</a>). There is some adhesion between the original left dorsal coelomic wall and the left leaf of the dorsal mesogastrium, although this does not extend as far as the spleen.
