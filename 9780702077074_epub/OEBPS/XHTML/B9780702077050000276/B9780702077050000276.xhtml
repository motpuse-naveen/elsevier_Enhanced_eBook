It receives primary afferent fibres from peripheral receptors located in widespread somatic and visceral structures, and sends motor axons to skeletal muscle. It also contains the cell bodies of all the preganglionic neurones responsible for the sympathetic innervation of cardiac and smooth muscle and secretory glands, and for the parasympathetic innervation of smooth muscle in the distal part of the hindgut, the pelvic viscera and the erectile tissues of the external genitalia. Many bodily functions are regulated at an unconscious level by intraspinal reflex connections between afferent and efferent neurones. Profuse ascending and descending pathways link the spinal cord with the brain, allowing higher centres to monitor and perceive external and internal stimuli and to modulate and control spinal efferent activity.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">External Features and Relations</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0015">The topographical anatomy of the spinal cord in relation to other structures within the vertebral canal is described in more detail in <a href="../B9780702077050000471/B9780702077050000471.xhtml">Chapter 47</a>. In brief, the cord begins just below the level of the foramen magnum where it is continuous rostrally with the medulla oblongata. It terminates caudally as the conus medullaris, which narrows into the filum terminale, anchored to the dorsum of the coccyx. The cord is ensheathed by spinal meninges that are continuous with the cranial meninges through the foramen magnum. Although it is approximately circular in cross-section, the diameter of the spinal cord varies according to level; it bears two enlargements, cervical and lumbosacral (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 27.1</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000276/main.assets/f27-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 27.1</span> A longitudinal diagram of the human spinal cord, with transverse sections through the spinal cord at representative cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral levels.

The spinal nerves attach to the cord as a linear series of small dorsal and ventral nerve rootlets. Dorsal rootlets contain afferent nerve fibres and ventral rootlets contain efferent fibres (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 27.1</a>). Groups of adjacent rootlets coalesce to form dorsal or ventral nerve roots that cross the subarachnoid space and unite to form functionally mixed spinal nerves as they exit the vertebral canal through the intervertebral foramina. The dorsal roots bear dorsal root ganglia which contain the cell bodies of primary afferent neurones.</div></section><section><a id="s0015"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0025">Internal Organization</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0025">In transverse section, the spinal cord is incompletely divided into symmetrical halves by a dorsal (posterior) median sulcus and septum and a ventral (anterior) median fissure (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 27.1</a>). The cord consists of an outer layer of white matter and an inner core of grey matter, their relative sizes and configuration varying according to the level. The amount of grey matter reflects the number of neuronal cell bodies present; it is proportionately largest in the cervical and lumbosacral enlargements, which contain the neurones that innervate the upper and lower limbs, respectively (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 27.1</a>). The absolute amount of white matter is greatest at cervical levels, where ascending tracts increasingly accumulate fibres, and decreases progressively at lower levels as descending tracts shed their fibres.</div><div class="text" id="p0030">A diminutive central canal, lined by columnar, ciliated epithelium (ependyma) and containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), extends the whole length of the spinal cord, lying in the centre of the spinal grey matter (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 27.1</a>). Rostrally, the central canal extends into the caudal half of the medulla oblongata and then opens into the fourth ventricle.</div><section><a id="s0020"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0030">Spinal grey matter</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0035">In transverse section, the spinal grey matter is often described as being ‘butterfly-shaped’ or resembling the letter ‘H’ (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 27.1</a>). It consists of two dorsal horns, which project dorsolaterally, and two ventral horns, which project ventrolaterally towards the surface. The grey matter that immediately surrounds the central canal and unites the two sides constitutes the dorsal and ventral grey commissures. The dorsal horn is the site of termination of the primary afferent fibres that enter the cord via the dorsal roots of spinal nerves. The tip of the dorsal horn is separated from the dorsolateral surface of the cord by a thin tract (of Lissauer), in which branches of primary afferent fibres ascend and descend for a short distance before terminating in the subjacent grey matter. The ventral horn includes efferent motor neurones; their axons leave the spinal cord in ventral nerve roots. A small lateral or intermediate horn is present at thoracic and upper lumbar levels; it contains the cell bodies of preganglionic sympathetic neurones.</div><div class="text" id="p0040">Spinal grey matter (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 27.2</span></a>) is a complex mixture of neuronal cell bodies, their processes and synaptic connections, neuroglia and blood vessels. Neurones in the grey matter are multipolar. They vary in size and features such as the length and the arrangement of their axons and <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="426" id="pagebreak_426"/><a id="pg426"/>dendrites. Neurones may be intrasegmental, i.e. contained within a single segment, or intersegmental, i.e. their ramifications spread through several segments. Research in a number of animal models has demonstrated groups of dorsal and ventral groups of interneurones, each with a characteristic genetic signature, some excitatory and some inhibitory. These different classes of interneurones have been demonstrated to be important for different reflex and locomotor activities (<a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Kiehn 2016</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000276/main.assets/f27-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 27.2</span> A transverse section of a spinal cord at a mid-lumbar level.

Many complex polysynaptic reflex paths (ipsilateral, contralateral, intrasegmental and intersegmental) start from this region, as also do many long ascending tract fibres that pass to higher levels. Lamina I (lamina marginalis) is a very thin layer with an ill-defined boundary at the dorsolateral tip of the dorsal horn. The much larger lamina II consists of densely packed small neurones that are responsible for its dark appearance in Nissl-stained sections. With myelin stains, lamina II is characteristically distinguished from adjacent laminae by the almost total lack of myelinated fibres. Lamina II corresponds approximately to the substantia gelatinosa. Laminae I and II are the primary termination for nociceptive peripheral afferents, and are also targets for descending projections from the cortex, brainstem and hypothalamus involved in modulatory control of these inputs. Lamina III consists of somata that are mostly larger, more variable and less closely packed than those in lamina II: it contains interneurones that transmit tactile and nociceptive afferent inputs to the cells of origin of ascending sensory pathways, including the dorsal columns and spinocervical tract. The ill-defined nucleus proprius of the dorsal horn corresponds to some of the cellular constituents of laminae III and IV. Lamina IV is a thick, loosely packed, heterogeneous zone permeated by fibres. Its neuronal somata vary considerably in size and shape, from small and round, through intermediate and triangular, to very large and stellate (<a href="#bib39" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_39">Schoenen and Faull 1990</a>). Laminae IV and V contain projection neurones that give rise to fibres in ascending pathways including the spinocervical and dorsal column pathways.</div><div class="text" id="p0055">Laminae V and VI lie at the base of the dorsal horn. They receive most of the terminals of proprioceptive primary afferents, profuse corticospinal projections from the motor and sensory cortices, and input from subcortical levels, suggesting their involvement in the regulation of movement. Lamina V is a thick layer, divisible into a lateral third and medial two-thirds. Both have a mixed cell population but the former contains many prominent somata interlaced by numerous bundles of transverse, dorsoventral and longitudinal fibres. Lamina VI is particularly prominent in the limb enlargements and is mostly concerned with local and propriospinal projections. It has an intensely staining medial third of small, densely packed neurones and a lateral two-thirds containing larger, more loosely packed, triangular or stellate somata.</div><div class="text" id="p0060">Lamina VII occupies the region just ventral to lamina VI and extends across the spinal grey matter on each side: this region is known as the intermediate zone throughout the cord. The size of lamina VII varies at different spinal levels. In the cervical and lumbar enlargements, it extends laterally and ventrally throughout the ventral horn, and cell groups of lamina IX neurones are embedded within it. In the thoracic region, lamina VII occupies the intermediate zone and the dorsal part of the ventral horn, and it includes the lateral horn. Lamina VII contains three important nuclear groups: the posterior thoracic nucleus (nucleus thoracis or Clarke’s column, <a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Figs 27.3A,C</span></a>), which extends throughout the thoracic and upper lumbar segments and gives rise to the fibres of the dorsal spinocerebellar tract; the intermediolateral nucleus, which is located between T1 and L2 and gives rise to the preganglionic sympathetic fibres; and the intermediomedial nucleus, which extends the full length of the cord and may be involved in the control of visceral motor neurones (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 27.3</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0065">Lamina VIII spans the base of the ventral horn in the thoracic region but is restricted to the medial aspect of the ventral horn in the cervical and lumbar enlargements. Its neurones display a heterogeneous mixture of sizes and shapes from small to moderately large. Lamina VIII is a mass of propriospinal interneurones. It receives terminals from the adjacent laminae, many commissural fibres from the contralateral lamina VIII, and descending connections from the interstitiospinal, reticulospinal, corticospinal and vestibulospinal tracts and the medial longitudinal fasciculus. The axons from these interneurones influence α motor neurone activity bilaterally, perhaps directly but also by reflex excitation of small γ motor neurones supplying efferent fibres to muscle spindles.</div><div class="text" id="p0070">Lamina IX consists of several distinct groups or columns of somatic motor neurones located throughout the ventral horn. In the thoracic cord, these nuclear groups are embedded within lamina VIII, whereas the lamina IX cell groups are embedded within both lamina VII and lamina VIII in the cervical and lumbar enlargements. Lamina IX is a complex array of cells consisting of α and γ motor neurones and many interneurones. The large α motor neurones supply motor end-plates of extrafusal muscle fibres in striated muscle. Recording techniques have demonstrated the existence of tonic and phasic α motor neurones. Tonic α motor neurones have a lower firing rate and lower conduction velocity, and tend to innervate type S muscle units. Phasic α motor neurones have a higher conduction velocity and tend to supply fast twitch motor units, either fast-resistable (FR) or fast-fatigable (FF) types. The smaller γ motor neurones give rise to small-diameter efferent axons (fusimotor fibres), which innervate the intrafusal muscle fibres in muscle spindles. There are several functionally distinct types of γ motor neurone. The ‘static’ and ‘dynamic’ responses of muscle spindles have separate controls mediated by static and dynamic fusimotor fibres, which are distributed variously to nuclear chain and nuclear bag fibres (<a href="#bib7" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_7">Boyd and Gladden 1985</a>). β-motor neurones innervate both extrafusal and intrafusal fibres which constitute the skeletofusimotor innervation that is particularly prominent in human hand and wrist muscles.</div><div class="text" id="p0075">Area X surrounds the central canal and is crossed by the dorsal and ventral grey commissures, which include the axons of commissural interneurones coordinating activity between the two sides of the spinal cord.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">The Rexed system provides the classification of neuronal cell groups in the spinal grey matter when considered in transverse section. These cell groups are also organized into longitudinal columns (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 27.3</a>), some of which have been mentioned already, such as the dorsal (posterior) thoracic nucleus (Clarke’s column) and the motor neuronal columns located in different subgroups within lamina IX. There are also columns of neurones in the dorsal horn, including the nucleus proprius. The intermediolateral cell columns in lamina VII provide preganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic outflows from the cord.</div></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0040">Dorsal horn</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0085">The dorsal horn is a major zone of termination of primary afferent fibres that enter the spinal cord through the dorsal roots of spinal nerves. Dorsal <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="427" id="pagebreak_427"/><a id="pg427"/>root fibres contain numerous molecules that are either known, or suspected, to fulfil a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role. These include glutamic acid, substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), bombesin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), cholecystokinin (CCK), somatostatin, dynorphin and angiotensin II (<a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Mai and Paxinos 2011</a>). Dorsal root afferents carry exteroceptive, proprioceptive and interoceptive information. Laminae I–IV are the main cutaneous receptive areas; lamina V receives fine afferents from the skin, muscle and viscera; lamina VI receives proprioceptive and some cutaneous afferents. Most, if not all, primary afferent fibres divide into ascending and descending branches on entering the cord that then travel for variable distances in the tract of Lissauer, near the surface of the cord, and send collaterals into the subjacent grey matter.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="428" id="pagebreak_428"/><a id="pg428"/></div><div class="text" id="p0090">The lamina marginalis (lamina I) is a thin lamina of neurones at the dorsolateral tip of the dorsal horn, deep to the tract of Lissauer. Beneath it lies the substantia gelatinosa (laminae II), which is present at all levels and consists mostly of small neurones, with some larger neurones. The substantia gelatinosa receives afferents via the dorsal roots; its neurones give rise to fibres that form the contralateral spinothalamic tract. The large propriospinal neurones of the nucleus proprius lie ventral to the substantia gelatinosa within laminae III and IV and link segments for the mediation of intraspinal coordination (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 27.3</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0095">The posterior thoracic nucleus can usually be identified from the eighth cervical to the third or fourth lumbar segments. It lies at the base of the dorsal horn within lamina VII, near the dorsal white funiculus, and may project into it. Neurones of the posterior thoracic nucleus vary in size but most are large, especially in the lower thoracic and lumbar segments; some send axons into the dorsal spinocerebellar tracts and some are interneurones.</div><section><a id="s0035"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0045">Local circuitry mediating pain transmission</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0100">The gate control theory (GCT) of pain describes a mechanism by which nociceptive input from the skin is modulated (‘gated’) by local circuits within the dorsal horn and by descending inputs from the brain (<a href="#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_24">Melzack and Wall 1965</a>). According to the GCT, interneurones in the substantia gelatinosa modulate afferent input to spinothalamic tract projection neurones that mediate onward transmission of nociceptive information to the brain. Increased activity in the collaterals of large-calibre non-noxious afferents excite substantia gelatinosa cells, which in turn inhibit the tract cells, i.e. the ‘gate’ is closed. Activity in small-calibre nociceptive afferents have the opposite effect of inhibiting the substantia gelatinosa interneurones and opening the ‘gate’ to nociceptive inputs. The main elements in the circuitry by which noxious and non-noxious primary afferent inputs are thought to influence projection neurones within lamina I of the dorsal horn are shown in <a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 27.4</span></a>.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0025"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000276/main.assets/f27-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0025"/><a id="fspara0025"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 27.4</span> Routes by which noxious (purple) and non-noxious (blue) primary afferent inputs may engage spinothalamic projection neurones in laminae I–IV of the dorsal horn. Nociceptive C and Aδ fibres (purple) activate neurokinin 1 (NK1)-expressing spinothalamic projection neurones of lamina I directly, and through the vertical cells (V) of the outer part of lamina II (IIo) indirectly (green axon). Nociceptive C fibres also activate central cells (C) of lamina II (IIi); the C cells contact, and probably excite, V cells in lamina IIo. Non-nociceptive Aβ fibres (blue) establish monosynaptic connections with local excitatory interneurones (E) of deeper laminae (III–IV), which directly activate V cells. These dorsally directed circuits are the route through which both noxious and non-noxious primary afferent input can engage the projection neurones of lamina I, which results in onward transmission in the spinothalamic tract. The excitatory circuits in the superficial dorsal horn are subject to profound inhibitory control (red), which allows for control of that onward transmission. For example, the majority of the inhibitory neurones (I) in lamina II are islet cells (I-i) and these can be directly engaged by input from low-threshold, mechanoreceptive C fibres (blue). The islet cells in turn establish monosynaptic inhibitory connections with both vertical cells of lamina IIo and NK1 receptor-expressing projection neurones of lamina I. Low-threshold Aδ and Aβ fibres (both in blue) also directly engage inhibitory interneurones in laminae IIi–IV. The latter in turn exert inhibitory control of a variety of excitatory interneurones, including vertical (V) and central (C) cells. According to the gate control theory the Aβ-to-inhibitory cell circuit is presumably responsible for closing the ‘gate’. <br/><span class="figcredit">Adapted with permission from Braz J, Solorzano C, Wang X et al 2014 Transmitting pain and itch messages: a contemporary view of the spinal cord circuits that generate gate control.

Islet cells are predominantly GABAergic (transmitting or secreting γ-aminobutyric acid); a subset co-express glycine and are presumed to be exclusively inhibitory. Radial and vertical cells are predominantly glutamatergic and presumed to be excitatory, and central cells include both inhibitory and excitatory subsets. All these interneurones can influence the output from spinothalamic projection neurones in lamina I (NK1 in <a href="#f0025">Fig. 27.4</a>). The input from C fibre nociceptors is concentrated in lamina I and lamina II (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 27.4</a>). Recent evidence has refocused attention on the concept of ‘labelled lines’ with each sensory modality processed via a fixed path from skin to brain. This applies to noxious heat, cold, noxious mechanical stimulation and pruritogens, at least at the level of the primary afferent input.

In the mesencephalon, these regions are the periaqueductal grey matter, dorsal raphe nucleus and part of the cuneiform nucleus. Neurones in these sites contain 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin), GABA, substance P, CCK, neurotensin, enkephalin and dynorphin. The periaqueductal grey matter receives afferents from the frontal, somatosensory and cingulate neocortices, the amygdala, numerous local reticular nuclei and the hypothalamus. Afferents from the latter are separate bundles that carry histamine, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), vasopressin, oxytocin, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), melanocyte-stimulating hormone (γ-MSH), endorphin and angiotensin II. Some fibres descend from the periaqueductal grey matter to nuclei of the brainstem, while others pass directly to the spinal cord.</div><div class="text" id="p0115">In the brainstem, the nucleus raphe magnus and the medial reticular column constitute an important multi-neuromodulation system, involving a number of different neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (see <a href="../B9780702077050000288/B9780702077050000288.xhtml#pg454">p. 454</a>). Neurones in these sites contain 5-HT, substance P, CCK, thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH), enkephalin and dynorphin; some neurones contain and release two or even three neurotransmitters. Descending corticospinal fibres from somatosensory cortex pass to the nucleus of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve and its continuation, the substantia gelatinosa. The latter extends throughout the length of the cord and contains populations of neurones that express many different neuromediators, e.g. GABA, substance P, neurotensin, enkephalin and dynorphin.

The motor neurones of lamina IX are somatotopically organized according to a medial-to-lateral and a dorsal-to-ventral gradient. The basic arrangement is that medial cell groups innervate the axial musculature, and lateral cell groups innervate the muscles of the limbs. Motor neurones innervating flexor muscles are located dorsally and those innervating extensors are located ventrally. The classical work of George Romanes demonstrated further subdivisions of these longitudinally orientated cell groups and the importance of spatial codes in the location of motor neurones innervating particular muscles: motor neurones innervating a specific muscle are located together in longitudinal clusters within the column and have a constant coordinate position within the cord. Clusters of motor neurones innervating synergist muscles form neighbouring groups or ‘columels’ that conform, in a precise pattern, to the three major rostrocaudal, mediolateral and dorsoventral axes of limb organization. Work in mice suggests that this positional map involves a motor neurone transcriptional network engaging the action of several Hox proteins (<a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Jessel et al 2011</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0145">The medial nuclear group extends throughout the length of the spinal cord. Its neurones innervate epaxial muscle groups and hypaxial muscle groups. Epaxial muscles are extensors of the head and vertebral column and include the erector spinae group: they are innervated by branches of the dorsal primary rami of the spinal nerves. Hypaxial muscles are flexors of the head and vertebral column and include the prevertebral muscles of the neck and the intercostal and anterior abdominal wall muscles: they are innervated by branches of the ventral primary rami. In the medial column, motor neurones supplying epaxial muscles are sited ventral to those that supply hypaxial muscles.</div><div class="text" id="p0150">The columns of the lateral nuclear group innervate the rest of the body musculature and their organization presents some segmental variations. In the thoracic region, the lateral group is small and innervates the lateral trunk muscles.

Ascending tracts carry afferent impulses to supraspinal levels and consist of either primary afferent fibres, which enter the cord via the dorsal roots of spinal nerves, or fibres derived from intrinsic spinal neurones. Descending tracts contain fibres that originate from cell bodies in the cerebral cortex or brainstem nuclei to control the activity of spinal neurones. Propriospinal tracts connect neurones that are localized entirely to the spinal cord and contain both ascending and descending components, collectively mediating intersegmental coordination.</div><div class="text" id="p0185">The spinal white matter is conventionally described as being arranged into three large, bilaterally paired masses, the dorsal, lateral and ventral funiculi, each of which contains a number of specific tracts (see <a href="#f0010">Figs 27.1</a>, <a href="#f0020">27.3B</a>, <a href="#f0040">27.7</a>).

Both tracts convey proprioceptive and exteroceptive information, but they are functionally different. Neurones of the posterior thoracic nucleus are excited monosynaptically by group Ia and Ib primary afferent fibres (from muscle spindles and tendon organs, respectively) and also by group II muscle afferents and cutaneous touch and pressure afferents. The proprioceptive impulses often arise from a single muscle or from synergistic muscles acting at a common joint. Thus, the dorsal spinocerebellar tract transmits modality-specific and space-specific information that is used in the fine coordination of individual limb muscles. On the other hand, the cells of the ventral tract are activated monosynaptically by Ib afferents and transmit information from large receptive fields that include different segments of a limb. The ventral tract lacks subdivisions for different modalities and transmits information for the coordinated movement and posture of the entire lower limb.</div><div class="text" id="p0255">Since the posterior thoracic nucleus diminishes rostrally (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 27.3</a>) and does not extend above the lowest cervical segment, it follows that the dorsal spinocerebellar tract carries information from the trunk and lower limb. Proprioceptive and exteroceptive information from the upper limb travel in primary afferent fibres of the fasciculus cuneatus. These fibres end somatotopically in the accessory (external or lateral) cuneate nucleus and the adjoining part of the cuneate nucleus situated in the medulla oblongata. Cells of these nuclei give rise to the posterior external arcuate fibres that form the cuneocerebellar tract (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 27.9</a>), which enters the cerebellum via the ipsilateral inferior cerebellar peduncle.

Spinothalamic tract cells in the thoracic cord display marked viscero-somatic convergence and so, for example, pain from cardiac disease such as angina or a myocardial infarction is commonly felt as a tightness around the chest wall (referred pain). Lamina I spinothalamic tract neurones project via the lateral spinothalamic tract and terminate preferentially in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus, with limited projections to the centrolateral intralaminar and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei. These projections are probably concerned with affective aspects of pain sensation.</div><div class="text" id="p0300">The spinothalamic neurones of the deep dorsal horn (laminae IV–VI) are of varied types. In the lumbar cord, for example, 60% are wide-dynamic-range types, 30% are high-threshold and only 10% are low-threshold types. They can accurately code both non-noxious and noxious cutaneous stimuli. Some cells also respond to input from deep somatic and visceral receptors. In the lumbar cord, their receptive fields are small or medium-sized: they are larger than the area of the foot but smaller than the entire leg. In the thoracic cord, the fields of these laminar cells are larger and often include the entire upper limb plus part of the chest. Many of the deep dorsal grey column spinothalamic tract neurones in the thoracic segments receive convergent input from visceral afferent fibres. Spinothalamic axons from laminae IV–VI project via the anterior (ventral) spinothalamic tract either to the ventral posterolateral nucleus or to the centrolateral intralaminar nucleus of the thalamus, and sometimes to both. Units projecting to the ventral posterolateral nucleus receive input from all classes (Aβ, Aδ and C) of cutaneous fibres.</div><div class="text" id="p0305">Spinothalamic neurones in the ventral horn (laminae VII and VIII) respond mainly to deep somatic (muscle and joint) stimuli but also to non-noxious and/or noxious cutaneous stimuli. In the thoracic regions of the spinal cord, they also receive convergent input from visceral sources. The majority of these neurones have large, complex receptive fields (often bilateral), which encompass widespread areas of the body. Cells of this group receive input from Aβ, Aδ and C classes of afferent fibres, and many respond to convergent input from receptors of deep structures. This population of neurones contains wide-dynamic-range (25%), high-threshold (63%) and low-threshold (12%) units. Most of the spinothalamic axons from the ventral horn project to the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, and these are again related to affective aspects of pain sensation. The wide-dynamic-range type of neurones are particularly effective for discriminating between different intensities of painful stimulation.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0080"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0090">Spinoreticular pathway</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0310">Spinoreticular fibres are intermingled with those of the spinothalamic tracts and ascend in the ventrolateral quadrant of the spinal cord (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 27.7</a>, <a href="#f0075">Fig. 27.14</a>). Evidence from animal studies suggests that cells of origin occur at all levels of the spinal cord, particularly in the upper cervical segments. Most neurones are in lamina VII, some are in lamina VIII, and others are in the dorsal horn, especially lamina V. Most axons in the lumbar and cervical enlargements cross the midline; there is a large uncrossed component in cervical regions. Most axons are myelinated. The pattern of anterograde degeneration, in both human postmortem studies and in experimental animals following anterolateral cordotomy, indicates the existence of spinoreticular projections to many nuclei of the medial pontomedullary reticular formation. There is also a projection to the lateral reticular nucleus (a precerebellar relay nucleus). These projections do not appear to be somatotopically organized. Spinoreticular neurones respond to inputs from the skin or deep tissues. Non-noxious cutaneous stimuli may inhibit or excite a particular cell, whereas noxious stimuli are often excitatory. A spino-reticulo-thalamo-cortical pathway has been proposed as an important route serving pain perception: like other ascending pathways, the tract cells are influenced by descending control. For example, electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal grey matter inhibits the responses of certain spinoreticular cells to input from cardiopulmonary afferents. Stimulation of the reticular formation also alters the activity of spinoreticular neurones.</div></section><section><a id="s0085"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0095">Spinocervicothalamic pathway</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0315">In humans, the lateral cervical nucleus is small and lies in the lateral funiculus, ventrolateral to the dorsal horn in the upper two cervical segments. In some human cord specimens it is not distinctly defined and is possibly incorporated into the dorsal horn. The lateral cervical nucleus receives axons from the spinocervical tract that ascends in the dorsolateral funiculus. The tract cells are found in laminae III–V at all levels of the spinal cord, ipsilateral to the nucleus. Most neurones of the nucleus project to the contralateral thalamus via the medial lemniscus, and some project to the contralateral midbrain. Specific thalamic targets include the ventral posterolateral nucleus and part of the posterior complex. Spinocervical tract neurones respond to hair movement, pressure, pinch and thermal stimuli and to high-threshold muscle input; many also respond to noxious stimuli. Like the tract cells of other ascending pathways, they are under tonic descending inhibitory control.</div></section><section><a id="s0090"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0100">Spinomesencephalic pathway</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0325">The spinomesencephalic pathway consists of a number of tracts ascending from the spinal cord to various regions of the midbrain. It includes the spinotectal tract projecting to the superior colliculus, neurones synapsing in the periaqueductal grey matter, and other spinal cord projections that terminate in the parabrachial nucleus, the pretectal nuclei and the nucleus of Darkschewitsch. Cells of origin are located throughout the length of the spinal cord, particularly in the cervical segments and the lumbosacral enlargement, mostly in lamina I, but they are also present in laminae IV–VIII, where they are concentrated in lamina V. Most are contralateral, but a prominent ipsilateral group is also found at upper cervical levels. Spinomesencephalic fibres are mostly myelinated and ascend in the white matter of the ventrolateral quadrant of the spinal cord, in association with the spinothalamic and spinoreticular tracts.</div><div class="text" id="p0330">Spinomesencephalic neurones are of low-threshold, wide-dynamic-range or high-threshold classes. Their receptive fields may be small, or very complex and encompass large surface areas of the body. Many spinomesencephalic cells are nociceptive and are likely to be involved in the motivational–affective component of pain. Electrical stimulation of their site of termination in the periaqueductal grey matter results in severe pain in humans. The cells of the deeper layers of the superior colliculus, where spinotectal fibres synapse, are activated by noxious stimuli.</div></section><section><a id="s0095"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0105">Spino-olivary tract</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0340">The spino-olivary tract is described in animals as arising from neurones in the deeper laminae of grey matter. Axons forming the tract cross and then ascend superficially at the junction of the ventral and lateral white funiculi, to end in the dorsal and medial accessory olivary nuclei. The tract carries information from muscle and tendon proprioceptors and from cutaneous receptors. A functionally similar route, the dorsal spino-olivary tract, ascends in the dorsal white funiculi and relays in the dorsal column nuclei to the contralateral inferior olivary nucleus. Information on these tracts in primates is scant, but postmortem evidence following cordotomies in humans has revealed degenerating axonal terminals in the inferior olivary nucleus.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0100"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0110">Descending tracts</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0345">Descending pathways to the spinal cord originate primarily from the cerebral cortex and from numerous sites within the brainstem (see <a href="#f0060">Figs 27.11</a>–<a href="#f0075">27.14</a>).

Corticonuclear projections include those to the cells of origin of other descending pathways (such as the reticulospinal tract), to cranial motor nuclei, and to cell groups such as the dorsal column nuclei. The majority of corticospinal and corticonuclear fibres arise from cells situated in the primary motor cortex (area 4), premotor cortex and supplementary motor areas (area 6), and cingulate motor cortex (area 24). A significant contribution comes from cells in the postcentral gyrus (somatosensory cortex; areas 3, 1 and 2) and the adjacent parietal cortex (area 5).

They then pass through the ventral part of the midbrain in the crus cerebri. As they continue caudally through the pons, they are separated from its ventral surface and fragmented into fascicles by transversely running pontocerebellar fibres. Corticopontine fibres, which are far more numerous than corticospinal or other corticonuclear fibres, terminate in the different divisions of the pontine nuclei (see <a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X.xhtml#f0090">Fig. 29.34</a>). Corticonuclear fibres terminate on cranial nerve and other nuclei of the midbrain, pons and medulla. In the medulla oblongata, the cortical efferent fibres destined for the spinal cord (corticospinal fibres) form a discrete bundle (the pyramid) on the ventral surface of the medulla: the corticospinal tract is therefore also referred to as the pyramidal tract (see <a href="../B9780702077050000288/B9780702077050000288.xhtml#f0025">Fig. 28.4</a>).

The largest diameter axons probably arise from the giant pyramidal neurones (Betz cells) of the primary motor cortex. The function of the smallest fibres is unknown.</div><div class="text" id="p0360">Just rostral to the spinomedullary junction, approximately 90% of the corticospinal fibres in the pyramid cross the midline in the decussation of the pyramids and continue caudally as the lateral corticospinal tract. About 10% of the fibres continue ipsilaterally as the ventral corticospinal tract and a small fraction descend ipsilaterally in the lateral corticospinal tract. The lateral corticospinal tract (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 27.12</a>) descends in the lateral funiculus throughout most of the length of the spinal cord until about the fourth sacral segment. It occupies an oval area, ventrolateral to the dorsal horn and medial to the dorsal spinocerebellar tract (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 27.7</a>). In the lower lumbar and sacral regions, where the dorsal spinocerebellar tract is absent, the lateral corticospinal tract reaches the dorsolateral surface of the cord. Studies in both human and non-human primates show that axons derived from the different cortical areas giving rise to the corticospinal tract (Brodmann’s areas 4, 6 etc.) remain separated within the internal capsule, but show increasing overlap as they pass from the crus cerebri to the pyramid and thence into the lateral corticospinal tract where the overlap is complete. As the lateral corticospinal tract descends, approximately 50% of the fibres terminate in the cervical cord, 20% in the thoracic cord and 30% in the lumbosacral cord.</div><div class="text" id="p0365">The smaller ventral corticospinal tract descends in the ventral funiculus (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 27.12</a>). It lies close to the ventral median fissure and is separated from it by the sulcomarginal fasciculus (medial longitudinal fasciculus, medial vestibulospinal tract; see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 27.7</a>). Near their <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="435" id="pagebreak_435"/><a id="pg435"/>termination, most fibres of the tract cross the midline in the ventral white commissure to synapse on contralateral neurones, which means that the vast majority of corticospinal fibres projecting to the cervical cord, irrespective of the tract in which they descend, terminate in the spinal cord on the side contralateral to their cortical origin. In contrast, some of the corticospinal fibres projecting to the lumbosacral cord have ipsilateral terminations. Corticospinal fibres from the motor areas do not terminate in the dorsal horn.</div><div class="text" id="p0370">Modern tractography methods have made it possible to image the course of the human corticospinal tract. Knowledge of the detailed termination of corticospinal fibres is based largely on animal studies, but is supplemented by data from postmortem studies on human brains using anterograde degeneration methods. Corticospinal projections from different cortical areas have different patterns of termination within the spinal grey matter. Most corticospinal fibres projecting to the cervical cord from the motor cortex terminate contralaterally on interneurones in the lateral parts of laminae IV–VI and both lateral and medial parts of lamina VII, which receives the strongest projection (<a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_28">Morecraft et al 2013</a>). Some corticospinal fibres are distributed to lamina VIII bilaterally.</div><div class="text" id="p0375">Corticospinal fibres from the motor areas also terminate directly on α motor neurones in lamina IX: these are the cortico-motoneuronal projections (<a href="#bib9000" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Lemon 2008</a>), which constitute the second largest projection from the motor cortex to the cervical cord (<a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Morecraft et al 2013</a>). The corticospinal tract therefore influences motor neurones both directly and indirectly, via interneurones, and this may involve branches of the same corticospinal axons. As the widespread dendrites of multipolar motor neurones in lamina IX extend into laminae VII and VIII, direct monosynaptic axodendritic contacts can also exist on large α motor neurones in these laminae. Direct terminations on motor neurones are most abundant in the spinal cord enlargements, and particularly in the dorsolateral motor nuclei supplying hand and digit muscles (<a href="#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_38">Schoen 1964</a>, <a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Morecraft et al 2013</a>). There is evidence in both human and monkey cortices for rostral and caudal subdivisions of area 4; most of the direct, cortico-motoneuronal projections originate from the caudal division, referred to as ‘new M1’ to reflect its more recent evolution (<a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Rathelot and Strick 2009</a>). In contrast, ‘old’ M1 lacks cortico-motoneuronal projections and its corticospinal fibres influence spinal motor neurones indirectly; it is also the source of major corticonuclear projections to brainstem structures giving rise to descending pathways such as the reticulospinal tract.</div><div class="text" id="p0380">Experimental evidence shows that precentral corticospinal neurones influence the activities of both α and γ spinal motor neurones, facilitating flexor muscles and inhibiting extensors, which are the opposite effects to those mediated by lateral vestibulospinal fibres. Evidence from animal studies shows that direct projections from the precentral cortical areas to spinal motor neurones are concerned with highly fractionated, precision movements of the limbs. Accordingly, in primates, precentral corticospinal fibres are mainly distributed to motor neurones supplying the distal limb muscles. Corticospinal projections probably use glutamate or aspartate, often co-localized, as excitatory neurotransmitters.</div><div class="text" id="p0385">Corticospinal fibres from parietal sources end mainly in the contralateral dorsal horn, including laminae I–II and the lateral parts of laminae IV–VI, and these fibres are a major source for the presynaptic inhibition of peripheral afferent input. They do not terminate in the ventral horn. Phylogenetically, these fibres may represent the oldest part of the corticospinal system (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Kuypers 1981</a>). Axons from the sensory cortex terminate chiefly in laminae IV and V and are concerned with the supraspinal modulation of the transmission of afferent impulses to higher centres, including the motor cortex.</div><div class="text" id="p0390">Experimental studies in primates indicate that complete transection of corticospinal fibres at the level of the pyramid (pyramidotomy) results in flaccid paralysis or paresis of the contralateral limbs and loss of independent hand and finger movements. Destruction of human corticospinal fibres at the level of the internal capsule, commonly caused by a cerebral vascular accident or ‘stroke’, results in a contralateral hemiplegia. The paralysis is initially flaccid but later becomes spastic, and is most marked in the distal muscles of the extremities, especially those concerned with individual movements of the fingers and hand. An abnormally active synergy develops between elbow flexors and shoulder abductors. Associated signs on the paralysed side are: hyperactive deep tendon reflexes; increased tone; the loss of superficial abdominal and cremasteric reflexes; and the appearance of dorsiflexion of the toes (Babinski sign) in response to stroking the sole of the foot. The latter is usually interpreted as pathognomonic of corticospinal damage, but it is not always present in patients with confirmed corticospinal lesions. Moreover, Babinski’s sign is normally present in human infants up to about 2 years of age; its subsequent disappearance may reflect the completion of myelination of the corticospinal fibres and/or the establishment of direct cortical connections to lower motor neurones.</div><div class="text" id="p0395">It is generally accepted that the sequelae of stroke damage to the internal capsule reflect a combination of negative effects, including weakness and loss of dexterity, and positive effects, in particular <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="436" id="pagebreak_436"/><a id="pg436"/>hyperreflexia and hypertonia.

The origin, localization, termination and functions of the rubrospinal tract are poorly defined in humans, and the tract is often referred to as rudimentary. Rubrospinal fibres cross in the ventral tegmental decussation and descend in the lateral funiculus of the cord, where they lie ventral to, and intermingled with, fibres of the lateral corticospinal tract (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 27.7</a>). In humans, the rubrospinal tract appears to project only to the upper three cervical cord segments: fibres are distributed to the lateral parts of laminae V–VI and the dorsal part of lamina VII of the spinal grey matter. The terminal zones of the tract are similar to those of corticospinal fibres from the motor cortex. In animals, the rubrospinal tract is considered to be part of the group of descending pathways that exert their main influence on muscles of the contralateral extremities.

The medullary reticulospinal terminals are more widely distributed, ending additionally in the lateral parts of laminae VI and VII, and also directly on motor neurones. In general, terminations of reticulospinal fibres that originate in the medulla are more dorsally placed than those that originate in the pons, although there is considerable overlap.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0075"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000276/main.assets/f27-14-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0075"/><a id="fspara0075"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 27.14</span> The spinoreticular (blue) and reticulospinal (red, black) tracts. <br/><span class="figcredit">Adapted with permission from Carpenter MB 1991 Core Text of Neuroanatomy, 4th ed.

The pontine reticulospinal tract appears to be tonically active and is excitatory to the antigravity muscles, including the epaxial muscles of the vertebral column and the extensor muscles of the lower limbs. In marked contrast, the medullary reticulospinal tract is inhibitory to antigravity muscles. The cells of origin of the medullary reticulospinal tract receive a dense cortical input from the rostral region of primary motor cortex (‘old M1’) and premotor cortex. The reticulospinal tracts normally function in a coordinated, balanced fashion to control muscle tone. However, if the descending control from higher centres is lost, such as occurs after a stroke in the internal capsule, then the natural excitability and enhanced connectivity of the ipsilateral pontine reticulospinal tract, combined with the activity of the vestibulospinal tracts, causes the antigravity muscles (upper limb flexors and lower limb extensors) to become hypertonic and hyperreflexic (spasticity), with weakened upper limb extensors (<a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_14">Guyton and Hall 2006</a>, <a href="#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Krakauer and Carmichael 2017</a>).

A pathway with somewhat similar course and terminations to that of the solitariospinal tract originates from the nucleus retroambiguus.

They are also distributed to laminae I and area X in the spinal cord. Descending fibres from the dopaminergic cell group (A11) situated in the caudal hypothalamus innervate sympathetic preganglionic neurones and neurones in the dorsal horn.

The majority of spinal neurones are propriospinal neurones, most of which lie in laminae V–VIII.

Propriospinal effects can be detected indirectly in humans and may be particularly important in the recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury (<a href="#bib33" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_33">Pierrot-Deseilligny and Burke 2005</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0490">Some propriospinal axons are very short and span only one segment, while others run the entire length of the cord.

Axons of long propriospinal neurones are distributed throughout the length of the cord, mainly via the ventral and lateral funiculi; their cell bodies are in lamina VIII and the dorsally adjoining part of lamina VII.

Up to 50% of the tract consists of propriospinal fibres: some are short axons of small substantia gelatinosa neurones which re-enter the dorsal horn and transmit nociceptive information onwards to cells that give rise to sensory ascending pathways.</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0160"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0170">Spinal Reflexes</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0510">The intrinsic connections of the spinal cord and brainstem subserve a number of reflexes by which the functions of peripheral structures are modulated in response to afferent information in a relatively automatic and autonomous fashion. The fundamental components of such reflex ‘arcs’ are an afferent and an efferent neurone, although in all but the simplest of reflexes, interneurones are intercalated between the afferent and efferent components, conferring increased versatility and complexity of reflex responses. Reflexes may be confined to a single cord level (intrasegmental) or involve several cord segments (intersegmental). By their very nature, reflexes are relatively fixed and stereotyped in form, nevertheless, they are strongly influenced and modulated by descending connections. In the case of spinal reflexes, these descending controls come from both the brainstem and the cerebral cortex. Pathology of descending supraspinal pathways is associated with abnormalities of spinal reflex activity that are routinely tested for in neurological examination: reflexes may be absent (areflexia), diminished (hyporeflexia) or exaggerated (hyperreflexia). During development, descending control mechanisms suppress what may be regarded as ‘primitive’ spinal reflex responses, such as the extensor plantar reflex and the grasp reflex: when the higher control mechanisms become damaged, these reflexes are released and reappear as a sign of central nervous system pathology (e.g. the Babinski reflex).</div><section><a id="s0165"/><section><a id="s0170"/><section><a id="s0175"/><section><a id="s0180"/><h3 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0175">Muscle stretch reflex</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0515">The muscle stretch reflex (also somewhat misleadingly called the tendon reflex or deep tendon reflex) is the mechanism by which stretch applied to a muscle elicits its reflex contraction.

Anatomically it is the simplest of reflexes, mediated by an afferent and an efferent neurone, and it is therefore also known as a monosynaptic stretch reflex or a myotatic reflex. The anulospiral endings of large sensory fibres (group Ia afferents) spiral around the intrafusal muscle fibres of muscle spindles (see <a href="../B9780702077050000033/B9780702077050000033.xhtml#f0170">Fig. 3.33</a>).

The site and the level of damage to the cord determine the particular clinical syndrome, e.g. whether the lesion involves the upper or lower cervical, thoracic or lumbosacral spinal cord. At each of these levels, symptoms and signs are determined by direct destruction of segmental tissue (transversely distributed damage) and disconnection of suprasegmental ascending and descending tracts above and below the level of a lesion (longitudinally distributed damage; <a href="#f0095">Fig. 27.18</a>). For example, a lower cervical spinal cord lesion damages the segmental sensory and motor contributions to the nerve roots and to the brachial plexus, causing sensory loss, weakness and wasting of the muscles and loss of tendon reflexes in the upper limbs. Disruption of the ascending sensory pathways in the lateral and dorsal columns of the cervical spinal cord leads to loss of sensation to pain and temperature (lateral spinothalamic tracts) and touch and proprioception (dorsal columns) below the ‘sensory level’ corresponding to the segment of the spinal cord. Damage to the descending corticospinal tracts in the lateral columns of the spinal cord produces a spastic paraparesis, i.e. increased tone of the muscles, weakness of an upper motor neurone pattern (weakness of extensors more than flexors in the upper limbs; weakness of flexors more than extensors in the lower limbs), exaggerated tendon reflexes and abnormal superficial reflexes, e.g. extensor plantar responses and absent abdominal reflexes. Descending pathways to the bladder are interrupted and this produces a ‘neurogenic bladder’, characterized by incontinence, frequency, urgency or retention of urine. The same principles apply to lesions at other levels of the spinal cord and these are illustrated in <a href="#f0095">Fig. 27.18</a>.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0095"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000276/main.assets/f27-18p1-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000276/main.assets/f27-18p2-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0095"/><a id="fspara0095"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 27.18</span> Lesions of the spinal cord. <br/><span class="figcredit">Adapted with permission from Crossman AR, Neary D Neuroanatomy: An Illustrated Colour Text, 4th ed.

Disorders with sudden or rapid onset are usually caused by trauma or by a vascular accident (i.e. stroke). When a condition develops over days it is often due to an inflammatory disorder such as multiple sclerosis. Neoplastic lesions such as a spinal cord meningioma often progress over months. Degenerative problems usually progress over months (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or motor neurone disease) or even years (e.g. hereditary spastic paraparesis).<span role="doc-pagebreak"
