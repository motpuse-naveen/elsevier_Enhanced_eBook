The activity of its billions of neurones constitutes the physical basis of sensory experience, motor behaviour, consciousness and self-awareness. Research to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie these functions is one of the most active areas of contemporary biology and medicine and is essential for the future treatment and prevention of neurological and psychiatric disorders.</div><div class="text" id="p5060">The nervous system has two major divisions, the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord. The PNS consists of the cranial and spinal nerves and their peripheral ganglia and ramifications. It is composed mainly of the axons of sensory and motor neurones that pass between the CNS and the body. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) consists of neurones located within both the CNS and PNS which control secretory glands and smooth and cardiac muscle. It is subdivided into sympathetic and parasympathetic components and is concerned primarily with control of the internal environment. Neurones in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract form the enteric nervous system (ENS) and are capable of sustaining local reflex activity that is independent of the CNS.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle5059">Central Nervous System</h2><div class="textfl" id="p5058">The brain and spinal cord (see <a href="../B9780702077050000471/B9780702077050000471.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 47.1A</a>) contain the great majority of neuronal cell bodies in the nervous system. In many parts of the CNS, neuronal cell bodies are grouped together and are, more or less, segregated from axons. The generic term for such collections of cell bodies is grey matter. Small aggregations of neuronal cell bodies, which usually share common connections and functional roles, are termed nuclei. Neuronal dendrites and synaptic interactions are mostly confined to grey matter. Axons tend to be grouped together to form white matter, so named because axons are often ensheathed in myelin, which confers a paler coloration on the tissue. Axons that pass between similar origins or destinations within the CNS tend to run together in defined pathways, or tracts. These often cross the midline (decussate), which means that one half of the body is, in many respects, controlled by, and sends information to, the opposite side of the brain.</div><div class="text" id="p5057">Some groups of neurones in the spinal cord and brainstem that subserve similar functions are organized into longitudinal columns. The neurones in these columns may be concentrated into discrete, discontinuous nuclei in some areas, e.g. the cranial nerve nuclei of the brainstem, or they may form more or less continuous longitudinal bands, as in much of the spinal cord (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 24.1</span></a>). Efferent neurones constitute three such columns. The axons of motor neurones in the somatic motor column innervate muscles derived from head somites. The two other columns are related to specialized features of head morphology: neurones in the branchial motor column innervate muscles derived from the wall of the embryonic pharynx (branchial muscles) and the visceral motor column supplies preganglionic parasympathetic fibres to exocrine glands and visceral smooth muscle. Four longitudinal cell columns are related to sensory functions. The general somatic sensory column essentially deals with general sensory information from the head; special somatic sensory neurones are related to the special senses and receive vestibular and auditory input; general visceral sensory neurones deal with information from widespread and varied visceral sensory endings; special visceral sensory neurones are related to the special sense of taste.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000240/main.assets/f24-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 24.1</span> The arrangement of sensory and motor cell columns in the spinal cord and brainstem.

These nerves contain afferent fibres that bring information into the CNS from sensory receptors, and efferent fibres that convey instructions from the CNS to peripheral effector organs. The spinal cord and brainstem can control many aspects of bodily function by reflex action mediated via interconnections of varying complexity between the afferent and efferent components of the spinal and cranial nerves. Numerous descending connections from the brain may modulate this activity. Afferent input to the spinal cord and brainstem is channelled into various ascending pathways, some of which eventually impinge upon the cerebral cortex, conferring conscious awareness.</div><div class="text" id="p5055">To provide the energy required by constant neuronal activity, the CNS has a high metabolic rate and a rich blood supply (<a href="../B9780702077050000264/B9780702077050000264.xhtml">Ch. 26</a>).

For the most part, the spinal cord receives afferent input from, and controls the functions of, the trunk and limbs. Afferent and efferent connections between the periphery and the spinal cord travel in 31 pairs of segmentally arranged spinal nerves that are attached to the cord as a linear series of dorsal and ventral rootlets. Adjacent groups of rootlets unite to form dorsal and ventral roots that combine to form the spinal nerves proper (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 24.2</span></a>).

In general, neurones situated in the dorsal horn are primarily concerned with sensory functions whilst those in the ventral horn are mostly associated with motor activities. At thoracic and upper lumbar levels of the spinal cord a small lateral horn is additionally present, marking the location of the cell bodies of preganglionic sympathetic neurones.

The medulla oblongata, pons and midbrain are collectively referred to as the brainstem: it lies upon the basal portions of the occipital and sphenoid bones (clivus). The medulla oblongata is the most caudal part of the brainstem and is continuous with the spinal cord below the level of the foramen magnum. The pons lies rostral to the medulla and is distinguished by a mass of transverse nerve fibres that connect it to the cerebellum. The midbrain is a short segment of brainstem, rostral to the pons. The cerebellum consists of paired hemispheres united by a median vermis: it lies within the posterior cranial fossa, dorsal to the pons, medulla and caudal midbrain, with all of which it has numerous fibre connections.</div><div class="text" id="p5048">The prosencephalon is subdivided into the diencephalon and the telencephalon. The diencephalon equates mostly to the thalamus and hypothalamus, but also includes the smaller epithalamus and <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="387" id="pagebreak_387"/><a id="pg387"/>subthalamus. The telencephalon is composed mainly of the cerebral hemisphere or cerebrum. The diencephalon is almost completely embedded in the cerebrum and is, therefore, largely hidden from the exterior. The human cerebrum constitutes the major part of the brain. It occupies the anterior and middle cranial fossae and is directly related to the calvaria. The surface of the cerebral hemisphere is convoluted into a complex pattern of ridges (gyri) and furrows (sulci). Internally, the hemisphere has an outer layer of grey matter, the cerebral cortex, beneath which lies a thick mass of white matter (<a href="#f0040"><span class="bold">Fig. 24.7</span></a>). One of the most important components of the cerebral white matter, the internal capsule (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 24.9</a>), contains nerve fibres that pass to and from the cerebral cortex and lower levels of the neuraxis. Several large nuclei of grey matter, the basal ganglia or basal nuclei, are partly embedded in the subcortical white matter. Nerve fibre connections between corresponding areas on either side of the brain cross the midline within commissures, the largest being the corpus callosum.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0040"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000240/main.assets/f24-07-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0040"/><a id="fspara0040"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 24.7</span> A section through the cerebral hemisphere and brainstem, showing the disposition of grey and white matter, the basal ganglia and the internal capsule. <br/><span class="figcredit">Dissection by EL Rees; photograph by Kevin Fitzpatrick, London.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p5047">During prenatal development, the walls of the neural tube thicken greatly but never completely obliterate the central lumen, which remains in the spinal cord as the vestigial central canal and becomes greatly expanded in the brain to form a series of interconnected cavities or ventricles (<a href="../B9780702077050000252/B9780702077050000252.xhtml">Ch. 25</a>). In the forebrain and hindbrain, parts of the roof of the neural tube do not generate nerve cells but become thin, folded sheets of highly vascular secretory tissue, the choroid plexuses which secrete cerebrospinal fluid into the ventricles. The cavity of the rhombencephalon becomes expanded to form the fourth ventricle dorsal to the pons and upper half of the medulla. Caudally, the fourth ventricle is continuous with a canal in the caudal medulla and, through this, with the central canal of the spinal cord. It is continuous with the subarachnoid space through three openings (the foramina of Luschka and of Magendie) and with a narrow channel, the cerebral aqueduct, at its rostral extent. The cerebral aqueduct passes through the midbrain and opens out rostrally into the third ventricle, a narrow, slit-like, midline cavity bounded laterally by the diencephalon. At the rostral end of the third ventricle, a small aperture on each side leads into the large lateral ventricle located within each cerebral hemisphere (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 24.4C</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0035">Overview of ascending sensory pathways</h3><div class="textfl" id="p5046">Sensory modalities are conventionally described as being either special senses or general senses. The special senses are olfaction, vision, taste, hearing and vestibular function: afferent information is encoded by highly specialized sense organs and transmitted to the brain in the olfactory, optic, facial, vestibulocochlear and glossopharyngeal nerves.</div><div class="text" id="p5045">The general senses include touch (ranging from light to discriminative), pressure, vibration, pain, thermal sensation and proprioception (perception of posture and movement). Stimuli from the external and internal environments activate a diverse range of receptors in the skin, fascia, viscera, muscles, bones, tendons and joints (<a href="../B9780702077050000033/B9780702077050000033.xhtml">Ch. 3</a>). Afferent impulses from the trunk and limbs are conveyed to the spinal cord in spinal nerves, while those from the head are carried to the brain in cranial nerves. The detailed anatomy of the complex pathways by which the various general senses impinge on consciousness levels is better <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="388" id="pagebreak_388"/><a id="pg388"/>understood by reference to certain common organizational principles. Whilst undoubtedly oversimplified and subject to exceptions, this schema is helpful in emphasizing the essential similarities that exist between the ascending sensory systems.</div><div class="text" id="p5044">In essence, ascending sensory projections related to the general senses consist of a sequence of three neurones that extends from peripheral receptor to contralateral cerebral cortex (<a href="#f0045"><span class="bold">Fig. 24.8</span></a>). These are often referred to as primary, secondary and tertiary neurones or first-, second- and third-order neurones. Primary afferents have peripherally located sensory endings and cell bodies that lie in dorsal root ganglia or the sensory ganglia associated with certain cranial nerves. Their axons enter the CNS through spinal or cranial nerves and terminate by synapsing on the cell bodies of ipsilateral second-order neurones, the precise location of which depends upon the modality.</div><section><a id="sf0045"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0045"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000240/main.assets/f24-08-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0045"/><a id="fspara0045"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 24.8</span> The organization of general sensory pathways showing first-order, second-order and third-order neurones.</figcaption></figure></div></section><div class="text" id="p5043">Primary afferent fibres carrying pain, temperature and light touch/pressure information from the trunk and limbs terminate in the dorsal horn of the spinal grey matter, near their point of entry into the spinal cord. Homologous fibres from the head terminate in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve in the brainstem. The cell bodies of second-order neurones are located in either the dorsal horn or the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. Their axons decussate and ascend to the ventral posterior nucleus of the contralateral thalamus as the spinothalamic or the trigeminothalamic tract, respectively; they synapse on the cell bodies of third-order neurones in the thalamus. Axons of third-order neurones pass through the internal capsule to reach the cerebral cortex, terminating in the primary somatosensory cortex in the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe.</div><div class="text" id="p5042">Primary afferent fibres carrying proprioceptive information and fine (discriminative) touch from the trunk and limbs ascend ipsilaterally in the spinal cord as the dorsal columns (fasciculus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus) and end by synapsing on second-order neurones in the dorsal column nuclei (nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus) of the medulla. Axons of second-order neurones decussate in the medulla and then ascend as the medial lemniscus to the ventral posterior nucleus of the contralateral thalamus, where they synapse on the cell bodies of third-order neurones. Axons of third-order neurones pass through the internal capsule and terminate in the primary somatosensory cortex. A similar homologous projection to the cortex exists for afferents derived from the head, except that primary afferent fibres carrying discriminative touch from the face and oral cavity terminate by synapsing on second-order neurones in the principal sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve.</div></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle5041">Overview of descending motor pathways</h3><div class="textfl" id="p5040">Corticofugal fibres descend through the internal capsule and pass into the brainstem, where many of them terminate in various cranial nerve nuclei and other brainstem nuclei such as the red nucleus, reticular nuclei, and olivary nuclei. The term ‘corticobulbar’ has been used for many years to describe cortical projections to brainstem nuclei but it is <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="389" id="pagebreak_389"/><a id="pg389"/>a misnomer. The suffix ‘bulbar’ is derived from ‘bulb’, an archaic name for the medulla oblongata. The term ‘corticonuclear’ is, therefore, more accurate to describe these connections although the term ‘bulb’ is still used (e.g. pseudobulbar palsy).</div><div class="text" id="p5039">Corticospinal (pyramidal tract) fibres originate from widespread regions of the cerebral cortex, including the primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe where the contralateral half of the body is represented in a detailed somatotopic fashion. The fibres descend throughout the length of the brainstem and the majority then cross to the contralateral side in the decussation of the pyramids in the ventral medulla. Thereafter, the majority of fibres continue caudally as the lateral corticospinal tract of the spinal cord and terminate in association with interneurones and motor neurones of the spinal grey matter (<a href="#f0050"><span class="bold">Fig. 24.9</span></a>). The principal function of the corticonuclear and corticospinal tracts is the control of fine, fractionated movements, particularly of those parts of the body where delicate muscular control is required. These tracts are particularly important in speech (corticonuclear fibres) and movements of the hands (corticospinal fibres).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0050"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000240/main.assets/f24-09-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0050"/><a id="fspara0050"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 24.9</span> The corticospinal and corticonuclear tracts.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p5038">The concept of ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ motor neurones is fundamental in clinical neurology because the motor signs and symptoms of damage to each category are different and are indicative of the anatomical site of the lesion. Lower motor neurones are the alpha motor neurones located in the brainstem and spinal cord that innervate the extrafusal muscle fibres of skeletal muscle. The term upper motor neurones refers collectively to all the descending pathways that impinge upon the activity of lower motor neurones but, in clinical parlance, the term is often equated with the corticonuclear and corticospinal tracts. The terms upper and lower motor neurone lesion are used clinically to distinguish, for example, between the effects of a stroke in the internal capsule (a typical upper motor neurone lesion) and those of motor neurone disease (a typical lower motor neurone lesion).</div><div class="text" id="p5037">Lower motor neurone lesions cause paralysis or paresis of specific muscles because the affected muscles have lost their direct innervation. There is also loss or reduction of tendon reflex activity and reduced muscle tone. Spontaneous muscular contractions (fasciculation) occur and affected muscles atrophy over time. Upper motor neurone lesions cause paralysis or paresis of movements as a result of loss of higher control. There is increased tendon reflex activity and increased muscle <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="390" id="pagebreak_390"/><a id="pg390"/>tone, but no muscle atrophy. The combination of paralysis, increased tendon reflex activity and hypertonia is referred to as spasticity. A positive plantar (Babinski) reflex is present with corticospinal lesions.</div><div class="text" id="p5036">The pathophysiology underlying the symptoms of upper motor neurone lesions is complex. This is because many descending pathways other than the corticonuclear and corticospinal tracts that also influence lower motor neurone activity may be compromised to varying extents, depending on the site of a lesion. These pathways include corticofugal projections to the brainstem that traverse the internal capsule (e.g. corticoreticular and corticopontine fibres), and numerous pathways that originate within the brainstem itself (e.g. reticulospinal and vestibulospinal tracts): their involvement is believed to be important in the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the generation of spasticity. Pure corticospinal tract lesions are exceedingly rare in humans because corticospinal tract fibres lie in close relationship to other pathways throughout most of their course: when they occur, they are believed to cause specific deficits in delicate, fractionated movements and to induce a positive plantar reflex.</div><div class="text" id="p5035">Two other major systems that contribute to the control of movement are the basal ganglia (basal nuclei) and the cerebellum. The basal ganglia are a group of large subcortical nuclei, the major components being the caudate nucleus, putamen and globus pallidus (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 24.7</a>; <a href="../B9780702077050000318/B9780702077050000318.xhtml">Ch. 31</a>). These structures have important connections with the cerebral cortex, certain nuclei of the thalamus and subthalamus, and with the brainstem. They appear to be involved in the selection of appropriate behavioural patterns/movements and the suppression of inappropriate ones. Disorders of the basal ganglia cause either too little movement (akinesia) or abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesias), as well as tremor and abnormalities of muscle tone (<a href="#bib6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_6">Crossman and Neary 2019</a>). The basal ganglia are sometimes described as being part of the so-called ‘extrapyramidal system’. This somewhat archaic term was introduced to distinguish between the effects of basal ganglia disease and those of damage to the ‘pyramidal’ (corticospinal) system. However, the progressive elucidation of the anatomy of the basal ganglia and of the pathophysiology of motor disorders has revealed the close functional interrelationship between the two ‘systems’, and has rendered the terms that distinguish them largely obsolete (<a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_3">Brodal 1981</a>). The cerebellum (<a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X.xhtml">Ch. 29</a>) has rich connections with the brainstem, particularly the reticular and vestibular nuclei, and with the thalamus.

The first cranial nerve (I; olfactory) has an ancient lineage and is derived from the forerunner of the cerebral hemisphere. It retains this unique position through the connections of the olfactory bulb, and is the only sensory cranial nerve that projects directly to the cerebral cortex rather than indirectly via the thalamus. The areas of cerebral cortex receiving olfactory input have a primitive cellular organization and are an integral part of the limbic system, which is concerned with the emotional aspects of behaviour. The second cranial nerve (II; optic) consists of the axons of second-order visual neurones and these terminate in the thalamus.

Maps of dermatome distribution are useful in clinical neurology as a guide to identify the location of pathology in patients with peripheral sensory deficits, but it is important to remember that they are approximations. Dermatome maps are somewhat inconsistently reported by different authors, reflecting the fact that the maps are composites that have been compiled to a large extent by clinical observations on patients with cranial or spinal nerve pathology, and also that considerable normal individual variation exists (<a href="#f0055"><span class="bold">Fig. 24.10</span></a>) (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Lee et al 2008</a>).

Its functions are closely integrated with those of the somatic nervous system.</div><div class="text" id="p5026">Visceral efferent pathways differ from their somatic equivalents because they are interrupted by peripheral synapses, which means that there is a sequence of at least two neurones between the CNS and the target structure: these are referred to as preganglionic and postganglionic neurones, respectively (<a href="#f0060"><span class="bold">Fig. 24.11</span></a>). The somata of preganglionic neurones are located in the visceral efferent nuclei of the brainstem and in the lateral horn of the spinal cord. Their axons, which are usually finely myelinated, exit from the CNS in certain cranial and spinal nerves, and then pass to peripheral ganglia, where they synapse on postganglionic neurones. The axons of postganglionic neurones are usually unmyelinated. Postganglionic neurones are more numerous than preganglionic ones; one preganglionic neurone may synapse with 15–20 postganglionic neurones, which permits the wide distribution of many autonomic effects.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0060"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000240/main.assets/f24-11-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0060"/><a id="fspara0060"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 24.11</span> Efferent pathways of the autonomic nervous system.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p5025">The autonomic nervous system is traditionally divided into two major parts: sympathetic and parasympathetic.

A better concept is that the two systems constitute an integrated system for the coordinated neural regulation of visceral and homeostatic functions. In general, sympathetic activity results in the constriction of cutaneous arteries (increasing blood supply to the heart, muscles and brain), cardiac acceleration, an increase in blood pressure, contraction of sphincters and depression of peristalsis, all of which mobilize body energy stores for dealing with increased activity. Parasympathetic activity results in cardiac slowing and an increase in intestinal glandular and peristaltic activities, which may be considered to conserve body energy stores.</div><div class="text" id="p5023">The classical concept of autonomic neurotransmission holds that preganglionic sympathetic and pre-and postganglionic parasympathetic neurones are cholinergic and postganglionic sympathetic neurones are mainly noradrenergic.

In the thorax, the trunks are anterior to the heads of the ribs, in the abdomen they lie anterolateral to the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, and in the pelvis they are anterior to the sacrum and medial to the anterior sacral foramina. The two trunks meet in a single, median, terminal ganglion, the ganglion impar, at the level of the sacrococcygeal junction. Cervical sympathetic ganglia are usually reduced to three, superior, middle and inferior, by fusion. The internal carotid nerve, a continuation of the sympathetic trunk, issues from the cranial pole of the superior cervical ganglion and accompanies the internal carotid artery through its canal into the cranial cavity. There are between 10 and 12 (usually 11) thoracic ganglia, 4 lumbar ganglia, and 4 or 5 ganglia in the sacral region.</div><div class="text" id="p7078">Preganglionic axons are myelinated, with diameters of 1.5–4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm, and join the sympathetic trunk through the white rami communicantes. On reaching the trunk, the axons behave in one of several ways (see <a href="#f0070">Fig. 24.13</a>). They can synapse with neurones in the nearest ganglion, or traverse the nearest ganglion and ascend or descend in the sympathetic trunk to end in another ganglion. A preganglionic fibre can terminate in a single ganglion or, through collateral branches, synapse with neurones in several ganglia. Preganglionic fibres may traverse the nearest ganglion, ascend or descend and, without synapsing, emerge in one of the medially directed branches of the sympathetic trunk to synapse in the ganglia of autonomic plexuses (mainly situated in the midline, e.g. around the coeliac and mesenteric arteries). More than one preganglionic fibre may synapse with a single postganglionic neurone. Uniquely, the suprarenal gland is innervated directly by preganglionic sympathetic neurones that traverse the sympathetic trunk and coeliac ganglion without synapsing.</div><div class="text" id="p7002">The cell bodies of postganglionic sympathetic neurones are located in the ganglia of the sympathetic trunk or in ganglia in more peripheral plexuses. Postganglionic axons are unmyelinated and are distributed to target organs in various ways. Those from a ganglion in the sympathetic trunk may return to the spinal nerve of preganglionic origin through a grey ramus communicans (which usually joins the nerve just proximal to the white ramus communicans), and they are then distributed through ventral and dorsal spinal rami to blood vessels, sweat glands, hairs, etc., in their zone of supply. Segmental areas vary in extent and overlap considerably and the extent of innervation of different effector systems, e.g. vasomotor, sudomotor, etc. by a particular nerve may not be the same. Alternatively, postganglionic fibres may pass direct to<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="394" id="pagebreak_394"/><a id="pg394"/>particular viscera, or innervate adjacent blood vessels, or pass along them externally to their peripheral distribution. They may ascend or descend before leaving the sympathetic trunk as described above. Many fibres are distributed along arteries and ducts as plexuses to distant effectors.</div><div class="text" id="p5019">Postganglionic sympathetic fibres that return to the spinal nerves are vasoconstrictor to blood vessels, secretomotor to sweat glands and motor to the arrector pili muscles within their dermatomes. Those that accompany the motor nerves to voluntary muscles are probably only dilatory. Most, if not all, peripheral nerves contain postganglionic sympathetic fibres. Those reaching the viscera are concerned with general vasoconstriction, bronchial and bronchiolar dilation, modification of glandular secretion, pupillary dilation, inhibition of gastrointestinal muscle contraction, etc. A single preganglionic fibre probably synapses with the postganglionic neurones in only one effector system, which means that effects such as sudomotor and vasomotor actions can be separate.</div></section><section><a id="s0065"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0075">Parasympathetic nervous system</h3><div class="textfl" id="p5018">Preganglionic parasympathetic neuronal cell bodies are located in certain cranial nerve nuclei of the brainstem and in the lateral horn (intermediolateral column) of the second to fourth sacral segments of the spinal cord. Efferent fibres, which are myelinated, emerge from the CNS only in the oculomotor, facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves, and in the second to fourth sacral spinal nerves. Preganglionic parasympathetic neurones are cholinergic.</div><div class="text" id="p5017">The cell bodies of postganglionic parasympathetic neurones are mostly sited distant from the CNS, either in discrete ganglia located near the structures they innervate, or dispersed in the walls of viscera. In the cranial part of the parasympathetic system, four small peripheral ganglia (ciliary, pterygopalatine, submandibular and otic) are all described on a regional basis. These are efferent parasympathetic ganglia, unlike the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal and vagal sensory ganglia, all of which are concerned exclusively with afferent impulses and contain the cell bodies of sensory neurones. The cranial parasympathetic ganglia are also traversed by afferent fibres, postganglionic sympathetic fibres and, in the case of the otic ganglion, by branchial efferent fibres, but none of these fibres synapse in the ganglia. Postganglionic parasympathetic fibres are usually unmyelinated and shorter than their counterparts in the sympathetic system because the ganglia in which the parasympathetic fibres synapse are either in or near the viscera they supply. Postganglionic parasympathetic neurones are cholinergic.</div></section><section><a id="s0070"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0080">Enteric nervous system and intrinsic neurones</h3><div class="textfl" id="p5016">Many peripheral autonomic ganglia contain neurones derived from the neural crest during embryonic development that are anatomically distinct from classical sympathetic and parasympathetic neurones. Connections between these intrinsic neurones allow them to sustain and modulate visceral activities by local reflex mechanisms. The enteric nervous system consists of many millions of neurones and enteric glial cells grouped into ganglionated plexuses lying in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract; ganglia containing neuronal cell bodies and glia are connected by bundles of axons to form myenteric and submucous plexuses that extend from the oesophagus to the anal sphincter (see <a href="../B9780702077050000598/B9780702077050000598.xhtml#f0050">Fig. 59.9</a>). This intrinsic circuitry mediates numerous reflex functions including the contractions of the muscular coats of the gastrointestinal tract, secretion of gastric acid, intestinal transport of water and electrolytes, and the regulation of mucosal blood flow (<a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_13">Poole and Furness 2012</a>). Although complex interactions occur between the enteric and sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, the enteric nervous system is capable of sustaining local reflex activity independent of the CNS.</div><div class="text" id="p5015">Since intrinsic neurones survive after section of the extrinsic sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, organs that are transplanted are not truly denervated. Separation from their autonomic input often has no obvious impact on the non-striated muscle or glands innervated by autonomic fibres; contraction may be unaffected and no structural changes ensue. This has been variously attributed to the continued activity of local plexuses or to the intrinsic activity of visceral muscle. In some important instances, however, denervation does result in cessation of activity, e.g. in sweat glands, pilomotor muscle, orbital non-striated muscle and the suprarenal medulla.</div></section><section><a id="s0075"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0085">Visceral afferent pathways</h3><div class="textfl" id="p5014">Visceral afferent pathways in many ways resemble somatic afferent pathways. The peripheral processes of visceral afferents run through autonomic ganglia or plexuses, and possibly through somatic nerves. Their central processes accompany somatic afferent fibres through cranial nerves or dorsal spinal roots into the CNS, where they establish connections that mediate autonomic reflexes and visceral sensation.</div><div class="text" id="p5013">General visceral afferent fibres from the viscera and blood vessels accompany their efferent counterparts, and are the peripheral processes of neuronal cell bodies located in the sensory ganglia of some cranial nerves and in dorsal root ganglia. They travel in the vagus, glossopharyngeal and possibly other cranial nerves; the second to fourth sacral spinal nerves, distributed with the pelvic splanchnic nerves; and thoracic and upper lumbar spinal nerves, distributed through rami communicantes and alongside the efferent sympathetic innervation of viscera and blood vessels.</div><div class="text" id="p5012">The cell bodies of vagal general visceral afferent fibres are in the superior and inferior vagal ganglia. Their peripheral processes are distributed to terminals in the pharyngeal and oesophageal walls where, acting synergistically with glossopharyngeal visceral afferents in the pharynx, they are concerned with swallowing reflexes. Vagal afferents are also believed to innervate the thyroid and parathyroid glands. In the heart, vagal afferents innervate the walls of the great vessels, the aortic bodies and pressor receptors, where they are stimulated by raised intravascular pressure. In the lungs they are distributed via the pulmonary plexuses. They supply bronchial mucosa, where they are probably involved in cough reflexes; bronchial muscle, where they encircle myocytes and end in tendrils that are sometimes regarded as muscle spindles and which are believed to be stimulated by change in the length of myocytes; interalveolar connective tissue, where their knob-like endings, together with terminals on myocytes, may evoke Hering–Breuer reflexes; the adventitia of pulmonary arteries, where they may be pressor receptors; and the intima of pulmonary veins, where they may be chemoreceptors. Vagal visceral afferent fibres also end in the gastric and intestinal walls, digestive glands and the kidneys. Fibres ending in the gastrointestinal tract and its ducts respond to stretch or contraction. Gastric impulses may evoke sensations of hunger and nausea.</div><div class="text" id="p5011">The cell bodies of glossopharyngeal general visceral afferents are in the glossopharyngeal ganglia. Their peripheral processes innervate the posterior lingual region, the palatine tonsils and the oropharynx, but they do not innervate taste buds. They also innervate receptors sensitive to tension and changes in the chemical composition of the blood in the carotid sinus and the carotid body: impulses from these receptors are essential to the integrity of circulatory and respiratory reflexes.</div><div class="text" id="p5010">Visceral afferents that enter the spinal cord through spinal nerve roots terminate in the spinal grey matter. Almost all the central processes of vagal and glossopharyngeal afferent fibres end in the nucleus tractus solitarius of the medulla. About 5% of the vagal afferents project directly to, and terminate in, the upper cervical spinal cord (C1–C2), where they are believed to contribute to referred sensations, as well as to propriospinal mechanisms of nociceptive modulation. Visceral afferents establish connections within the CNS that mediate autonomic reflexes. They probably also mediate visceral sensations such as hunger, nausea, sexual excitement and vesical distension, etc. Visceral pain fibres may follow these routes. Although viscera are insensitive to cutting, crushing or burning, excessive tension in smooth muscle and some pathological conditions produce visceral pain. In visceral disease, vague pain may be felt near the viscus itself (visceral pain) or in a cutaneous area or other tissue from which somatic afferents enter spinal segments that also receive afferents from the viscus, a phenomenon known as referred pain. If inflammation spreads from a diseased viscus to the adjacent parietal serosa (e.g. the peritoneum), somatic afferents will be stimulated, causing local somatic pain, which is commonly spasmodic. Referred pain is often associated with local cutaneous tenderness.

Vesical receptors are widespread; those in muscle strata are associated with thickly myelinated fibres and are believed to be stretch receptors, possibly activated by contraction. Pain fibres from the bladder and proximal urethra travel in both the pelvic splanchnic nerves and the inferior hypogastric plexus, hypogastric nerves, superior hypogastric plexus and lumbar splanchnic nerves to reach their cell bodies in ganglia on the lower thoracic and <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="395" id="pagebreak_395"/><a id="pg395"/>upper lumbar dorsal spinal roots. Lesions of the cauda equina abolish pain from vesical overdistension; hypogastric section is ineffective. Pain fibres from the uterus traverse the hypogastric plexus and lumbar splanchnic nerves to reach their cell bodies in the lowest thoracic and upper lumbar spinal ganglia; hypogastric division may relieve dysmenorrhoea. Afferents from the uterine cervix traverse the pelvic splanchnic nerves to reach their cell bodies in the upper sacral spinal ganglia; stretching the cervix uteri causes pain but cauterization and biopsy excisions do not.</div><div class="text" id="p5008">In general, afferent fibres that accompany pre- and postganglionic sympathetic fibres have a segmental arrangement and end in spinal cord segments from which preganglionic fibres innervate the region or viscus concerned. General visceral afferents entering thoracic and upper lumbar spinal segments are largely concerned with pain. Nociceptive impulses from the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, intestines, kidneys, ureter, gallbladder and bile ducts seem to be carried in sympathetic pathways. Cardiac nociceptive impulses enter the spinal cord in the first to fifth thoracic spinal nerves, mainly via the middle and inferior cardiac nerves; some fibres pass directly to the spinal nerves. Peripherally, the fibres pass through the cardiac plexuses and along the coronary arteries. Myocardial anoxia may evoke symptoms of angina pectoris in which pain is typically presternal, and is also referred to much of the left chest, and radiates to the left shoulder, the medial aspect of the left arm, along the left side of the neck to the jaw and occiput, and down to the epigastrium. Cardiac afferents carried in vagal cardiac branches are concerned with the reflex depression of cardiac activity. Ureteric pain fibres, also running with sympathetic fibres, are presumably involved in the agonizing renal colic that follows obstruction by calculi. Afferent fibres from the testis and ovary run through the corresponding plexuses to neuronal call bodies in the tenth and eleventh thoracic dorsal root ganglia.</div><div class="text" id="p5007">Some of the primary afferent neurones that innervate the gut, lungs, heart and blood vessels, also appear to have an efferent function in that they release transmitters from their peripheral endings during the axon reflex. The primary substances released in this way are substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and ATP. These act on target cells to produce vasodilation, increased venular permeability, changes in smooth muscle contractility, degranulation of mast cells and a variety of effects on leukocytes and fibroblasts, a process collectively known as ‘peripheral neurogenic inflammation’. The local release of such substances may play a trophic role in the maintenance of tissue integrity and repair in response to injury (for further reading, see <a href="#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Xanthos and Sandkühler (2014)</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0080"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0090">Paraganglia</h3><div class="textfl" id="p5006">Paraganglia are extra-suprarenal aggregations of neuroepithelial cells.

Paraganglia can be divided into two broad categories, non-chromaffin and chromaffin. Non-chromaffin paraganglia are related to the parasympathetic system, particularly in the head and neck, where they tend to be associated with the glossopharyngeal or vagus nerves (carotid body, promontory of the middle ear, tunica adventitia of the jugular bulb, facial canal, ganglion nodosum, larynx). Chromaffin paraganglia are connected with the orthosympathetic system (in the sympathetic ganglia of various viscera and a variety of thoracolumbar para-aortic retroperitoneal sites). Small paraganglia have also been reported incidentally in the urinary bladder, prostate, gallbladder, splenic capsule and mesosigmoid. Their functions differ with location: some cells act as interneurones, others as sources of neuroendocrine secretion. Paraganglionic catecholamine release occurs mainly in response to chemical rather than to neural stimuli. Extra-suprarenal chromaffin tissue is prominent in the fetus, and acts as the main source of catecholamines while the suprarenal medulla is immature. Although many paraganglia degenerate soon after birth, others persist into adulthood, often as microscopic paraganglia.</div><section><a id="sf0075"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0075"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000240/main.assets/f24-14-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0075"/><a id="fspara0075"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 24.14</span> The principal aggregations of ‘classic’ chromaffin tissue in the human neonate.

The lateral sulcus extends posteroinferiorly from the Sylvian point, which <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="396" id="pagebreak_396"/><a id="pg396"/>is located in the region of the pterion, about 3cm posterior to the zygomatic process of the frontal bone, to a vertical line passing through the apex (tip) of the mastoid process.
