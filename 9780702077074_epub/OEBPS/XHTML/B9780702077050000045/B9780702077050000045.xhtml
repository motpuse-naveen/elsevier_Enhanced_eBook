One is to provide a mechanism for the transport of materials around the body (including gases, nutrients and waste products). The second is to support the immune system, whose main role is to protect from dangerous infections with pathogens. The main cells that circulate in the blood are the erythrocytes (red blood cells) and leukocytes (white blood cells), as well as platelets that are cellular fragments of large megakaryocytes which play a role in blood clotting. These are all formed in the bone marrow, though the further development of some of the lymphocytes occurs in the thymus. Erythrocytes and platelets remain in the circulation, while leukocytes not only circulate through the blood but reside in the lymphoid tissues (thymus, lymph nodes, spleen), as well as circulating in the lymphatics and through tissues (especially during inflammation). Other cells also contribute to the immune system, in particular cells involved in antigen presentation.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">adaptive immunity; blood; bone marrow; erythrocyte; granulocytes; immune system; innate immunity; lymph node; lymphocytes; MALT; monocytes; platelets; spleen; thymus</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">Blood is an opaque fluid with a viscosity greater than that of water (mean relative viscosity 4.75 at 18<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>°C), and a specific gravity of 1.06 at 15<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>°C.

Haemopoiesis produces red cells (erythrocytes) and a wide variety of immune defense cells (white blood cells, or leukocytes). The latter include neutrophil, eosinophil and basophil granulocytes, B lymphocytes and monocytes. T lymphocytes develop in the thymus from bone marrow-derived progenitors. These cells all contribute to the immune system (for an overview of the immune system, see <a href="#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_38">Murphy and Weaver (2016)</a>). Platelets are produced in the bone marrow as cellular fragments of megakaryocytes. Only erythrocytes and platelets are generally confined to the blood vascular system, whereas all leukocytes can leave the circulation and enter extravascular tissues. The numbers of cells doing so increases greatly during inflammation caused by local infections or tissue damage.</div><div class="text" id="p0030">The lymphoid tissues are the thymus, lymph nodes, spleen and the lymphoid follicles associated mainly with the alimentary and respiratory tracts. Lymphocytes populate lymphoid tissues and are concerned with immune defence. Lymphoid tissue also contains supportive stromal cells, which are non-haemopoietic in origin (e.g. thymic epithelium); non-haemopoietic follicular dendritic cells of lymph nodes and splenic follicles; haemopoietically derived dendritic cells; and macrophages of the mononuclear phagocyte system.

Their sialic acid groups confer most of the fixed charge on the cell surface. A second transmembrane macromolecule, band 3 protein, forms an important anion channel, exchanging bicarbonate for chloride ions across the membrane and allowing the release of CO<sub>2</sub> in the lungs.</div><div class="text" id="p0055">The filamentous protein, spectrin, is responsible for maintaining the shape of the erythrocyte. A dimer is formed of α1 and β1 spectrin monomers, and two dimers then come together to form a tetramer (<a href="#bib27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_27">Machnicka et al 2013</a>).

The junctional complex also interacts with transmembrane proteins. This structure gives the membrane great flexibility; red cells are deformable but regain their biconcave shape and dimensions after passing through the smallest capillaries, which are 4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm in diameter (<a href="#bib37" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_37">Mohandas and Gallagher 2008</a>).

It consists of globulin molecules bound to haem, an iron-containing porphyrin group. The oxygen-binding power of Hb is provided by the iron atoms of the haem groups, and these are maintained in the ferrous (Fe<sup>++</sup>) state by the presence of glutathione within the erythrocyte. The Hb molecule is a tetramer, made up of four subunits, each a coiled polypeptide chain holding a single haem group.</div><div class="text" id="p0075">In normal blood, five types of haemoglobin polypeptide chain can occur: namely, α, β and two β-like polypeptides, γ and δ. A third, β-like η chain is restricted to early fetal development. Each haemoglobin molecule contains two α-chains and two others, so that several combinations, and hence a number of different types of haemoglobin molecule, are possible. For example, haemoglobin A (HbA), which is the major adult class, contains 2 α- and 2 β-chains; a variant, HbA<sub>2</sub> with 2 α- and 2 δ-chains, accounts for only 2% of adult haemoglobin. Haemoglobin F (HbF), found in fetal and early postnatal life, consists of 2 α- and 2 γ-chains. Adult red cells normally contain less than 1% of HbF.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">Mutations in the haemoglobin chains can result in a range of pathologies (<a href="#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_8">Forget and Bunn 2013</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0085">In the genetic condition thalassaemia, only one type of chain is expressed normally, the mutant chain being absent or present at much reduced levels. Thus, a molecule may contain 4 α-chains (β-thalassaemia) or 4 β-chains (α-thalassaemia). In haemoglobin S (HbS) of sickle-cell disease, a point mutation in the β-chain gene (valine substituted for glutamine) causes the haemoglobin to polymerize under conditions of low oxygen concentration, thus deforming the red blood cell.</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0035">Lifespan</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0090">Erythrocytes last between 100 and 120 days before being destroyed. As erythrocytes age, they become increasingly fragile, and their surface charge decreases as their content of negatively charged membrane glycoproteins diminishes. The lipid content of their membranes also reduces. Aged erythrocytes are taken up by the macrophages of the spleen (<a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Mebius and Kraal 2005</a>) and liver sinusoids, usually without prior lysis, and are hydrolysed in phagocytic vacuoles where the haemoglobin is split into its globulin and porphyrin moieties. Globulin is further degraded to amino acids, which pass into the general amino-acid pool. Iron is removed from the porphyrin ring and either transported in the circulation bound to transferrin and used in the synthesis of new haemoglobin in the bone marrow, or stored in the liver as ferritin or haemosiderin. The remainder of the haem group is converted in the liver to bilirubin and excreted in the bile. Haemoglobin that is released by destruction of erythrocytes in the body binds to haptoglobin, and is taken up via CD (antigenic Cluster of Differentiation marker of cell type)163 receptors expressed on the surface of macrophages (<a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_22">Kristiansen et al 2001</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0095">The recognition of effete erythrocytes by macrophages takes place by a number of mechanisms. These include the exposure extracellularly of phospholipids (such as phosphatidyl serine) that are normally found on the inner leaflet of the membrane bilayer, alterations in the carbohydrates expressed by the cells (most notably the loss of sialic acid) and the binding of autoantibodies to antigens exposed on the aged erythrocyte. These lead to the cells being recognised and taken up by macrophages. Red cells are destroyed at the rate of 5 ×10<sup>11</sup> cells a day (or nearly 6 million a second) and are normally replaced from the bone marrow (see <a href="#f0090">Fig. 4.12</a>) at the same rate.</div></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0040">Blood groups</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0105">Over 300 red cell antigens are recognizable with specific antisera. They can interact with naturally occurring or induced antibodies in the plasma of recipients of an unmatched transfusion, causing agglutination and lysis of the erythrocytes. Erythrocytes of a single individual carry several different types of antigen, each type belonging to an antigenic system in which a number of alternative antigens are possible in different persons. So far, 19 major groups have been identified. They vary in their distribution frequencies between different populations, and include the ABO, Rhesus, MNS, Lutheran, Kell, Lewis, Duffy, Kidd, Diego, Cartwright, Colton, Sid, Scianna, Yt, Auberger, Ii, Xg, Indian and Dombrock systems. Clinically, the ABO and Rhesus groups are of most importance.</div><div class="text" id="p0110">In the ABO system, two allelic genes are inherited in simple Mendelian fashion. Thus the genome may be homozygous and carry the AA complement, the blood group being A, or the BB complement, which gives blood group B, or it may carry neither (OO), producing blood group O. In the heterozygous condition the following combinations can occur: AB (blood group AB), AO (blood group A) and BO (blood group B). The ABO blood group antigens are all membrane glycolipids.</div><div class="text" id="p0115">Individuals with group AB blood lack antibodies to both A and B antigens, and so can be transfused with blood of any group; they are termed universal recipients. Conversely, those with group O, universal donors, can give blood to any recipient, since anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the donated blood are diluted to insignificant levels. Normally, however, blood is only transfused between persons with corresponding groups because anomalous antibodies of the ABO system are occasionally found in blood and may cause agglutination or lysis. The anti-ABO agglutinins, unlike those of the Rhesus system, belong to the immunoglobulin M (IgM) class and do not cross the placenta during pregnancy.</div><div class="text" id="p0120">The Rhesus antigen system is determined by three sets of alleles: namely, Cc, Dd and Ee. The most important clinically is Dd. Inheritance of the Rh factor also obeys simple Mendelian laws; it is therefore possible for a Rhesus-negative mother to bear a Rhesus-positive child. Under these circumstances, fetal Rh antigens can stimulate the production of anti-Rh antibodies by the mother; as these belong to the IgG class of antibody they are able to cross the placenta. For most of the pregnancy the stroma stops the blood group antibodies from crossing into the fetal circulation. However, immediately prior to birth, the antibodies can cross this barrier and cause destruction of fetal erythrocytes. In the first such pregnancy little damage usually occurs because anti-Rh antibodies have not been induced, but in subsequent Rh-positive pregnancies massive destruction of fetal red cells may result, causing fetal or neonatal death (haemolytic disease of the newborn). Sensitization of the maternal immune system can also result from abortion or miscarriage, or occasionally even from amniocentesis, which may introduce fetal antigens into the maternal circulation. Treatment is by exchange transfusion of the neonate or, prophylactically, by giving Rh-immune (anti-D) serum to the mother after the first Rh-positive pregnancy, which destroys the fetal Rh antigen in her circulation before sensitization can occur.</div><div class="text" id="p0125">Leukocytes also bear highly polymorphic antigens encoded by allelic gene variants. These belong to the group of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, also termed human leukocyte antigens (HLA) in humans. HLA class I antigens are expressed by all nucleated cells. Class II antigens are expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) of the immune system, but can also be induced on many parenchymal cell types, e.g. after exposure to interferon. HLA class I and II antigens play important roles in cell–cell interactions in the immune system, particularly in the presentation of antigens to T lymphocytes by APCs.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0045">Leukocytes</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0130">Leukocytes (white blood cells) belong to at least five different categories (see <a href="#f0090">Fig. 4.12</a>) and are distinguishable by their size, nuclear shape and cytoplasmic inclusions.

Specific or secondary granules are formed later, and occur in a wide range of shapes including spheres, ellipsoids and rods. These contain strong bacteriocidal components including alkaline phosphatase, lactoferrin and collagenase, none of which is found in primary granules. Conversely, secondary granules lack peroxidase and acid phosphatase. Some enzymes, e.g. lysozyme, are present in both types of granule.</div><div class="text" id="p0155">In mature neutrophils the nucleus is characteristically multilobed with up to six (usually three or four) segments joined by narrow nuclear strands; this is known as the segmented stage. Less mature cells have fewer lobes. The earliest to be released under normal conditions are juveniles (band or stab cells), in which the nucleus is an unsegmented crescent or band. In certain clinical conditions, even earlier stages in neutrophil formation, when cells display indented or rounded nuclei (metamyelocytes or myelocytes) may be released from the bone marrow. In mature cells the edges of the nuclear lobes are often irregular. In females 3% of the nuclei of neutrophils show a conspicuous ‘drumstick’ formation, which represents the sex chromatin of the inactive X chromosome (Barr body). Neutrophil cytoplasm contains few mitochondria but abundant cytoskeletal elements, including actin filaments, microtubules and their associated proteins, all characteristic of highly motile cells.</div><div class="text" id="p0160">Neutrophils are important in the defence of the body against microorganisms. They can phagocytose microbes and small particles in the circulation and, after extravasation, they carry out similar activities in other tissues. They function effectively in relatively anaerobic conditions, relying largely on glycolytic metabolism, and they fulfil an important role in the acute inflammatory phase of tissue injury, responding to chemotaxins released by damaged tissue. Phagocytosis of cellular debris or invading microorganisms is followed by fusion of the phagocytic vacuole with granules, which results in bacterial killing and digestion. Actively phagocytic neutrophils are able to reduce oxygen enzymatically to form reactive oxygen species including superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, which enhance bacterial destruction probably by activation of some of the granule contents (<a href="#bib48" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_48">Segal 2005</a>, <a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">Nathan 2006</a>). Neutrophils can also produce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are web-like structures composed of DNA and proteolytic enzymes that can trap bacteria and kill them (<a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Kaplan and Radic 2012</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0165">Phagocytosis is greatly facilitated by circulating antibodies to molecules such as bacterial antigens, which the body has previously encountered. Antibodies (acting as opsonins) coat the antigenic target and bind the plasma complement protein, C1, to their non-variable Fc regions. This activates the complement cascade via the classical pathway, which involves some 20 plasma proteins synthesized mainly in the liver, and completes the process of opsonization. The complement cascade involves the sequential cleavage of the complement proteins into a large fragment, which generally binds to the antigenic surface, and a small bioactive fragment, which is released. The final step is the recognition of complement by receptors on the surfaces of neutrophils and macrophages, which promotes phagocytosis of the microorganism.</div><div class="text" id="p0170">Complement activation can be triggered via three pathways: classical, lectin and alternative. The classical pathway is activated by C1q binding to antigen-bound antibodies. The lectin pathway is triggered by mannan-binding lectin (MBL) interacting with carbohydrate patterns on the microbial surface. The alternative pathway relies on autoactivation of complement component C3 on the microbial surface. The products of complement activation have functions of opsonization, cytotoxicity and recruitment of infiltrating cells to the site of infection or injury.</div><div class="text" id="p0175">Neutrophils are short-lived; they spend some 6–7 hours circulating in the blood and a few days in connective tissues. The number of circulating neutrophils varies, and often rises during episodes of acute bacterial infection. They die after carrying out their phagocytic role; dead neutrophils, bacteria, tissue debris (including tissue damaged by neutrophil enzymes and toxins) and interstitial fluid form the characteristic, greenish-yellow pus of infected tissue. The colour is derived from the natural colour of neutrophil myeloperoxidase.</div><div class="text" id="p0180">Granules may also be released inappropriately from neutrophils.

The surrounding matrix contains several lysosomal enzymes including acid phosphatase, ribonuclease, phospholipase and a myeloperoxidase unique to eosinophils.</div><div class="text" id="p0190">Like other leukocytes, eosinophils are motile. When suitably stimulated, they are able to pass into the extravascular tissues from the circulation. They are typical minor constituents of the dermis, and of the connective tissue components of the bronchial tree, alimentary tract, uterus and vagina. The total lifespan of these cells is a few days, of which some 10 hours is spent in the circulation, and the remainder in the extravascular tissues.</div><div class="text" id="p0195">Eosinophil numbers rise (eosinophilia) in worm infestations and also in certain allergic disorders, and it is thought that they evolved as a primary defence against parasitic attack. They have surface receptors for IgE that bind to IgE-antigen complexes, triggering phagocytosis and release of granule contents. However, they are only weakly phagocytic and their most important function is the destruction of parasites too large to phagocytose. This antiparasitic effect is mediated via toxic molecules released from their granules (e.g. eosinophil cationic protein and major basic protein). They also release histaminase, which limits the inflammatory consequences of mast cell degranulation. High local concentrations of eosinophils, e.g. in bronchial asthma and in cutaneous contact hyper sensitivity and allergic eczema, can cause tissue destruction as a consequence of the release of molecules such as collagenase from their granules.</div></section><section><a id="s0055"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0065">Basophil granulocytes</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0200">Slightly smaller than other granulocytes, basophil granulocytes are 10–14<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm in diameter, and form only 0.5–1% of the total leukocyte population of normal blood, with a count of 25–200/μl.

The granules are membrane-bound vesicles that display a variety of crystalline, lamellar and granular inclusions: they contain heparin, histamine and several other inflammatory agents, and closely resemble those of tissue mast cells. Both basophils and mast cells have high-affinity membrane receptors for IgE and are therefore coated with IgE antibody. If this binds to its antigen it triggers degranulation of the cells, causing vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, chemotactic stimuli for other granulocytes, and the symptoms of immediate hypersensitivity, e.g. in allergic rhinitis (hay fever). Despite these similarities, basophils and mast cells develop as separate lineages in the myeloid series, from haemopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Evidence from experimental animal models suggests that they are closely related (see <a href="#f0090">Fig. 4.12</a>) but studies on mast cell disorders in humans indicate that their lineages diverge from a more distant ancestral progenitor (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Kocabas et al 2005</a>).

Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an antibody that binds to receptors on the surfaces of mast cells, eosinophils and blood basophils, and is found only at low concentrations in the circulation. IgE is mostly associated with type I hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions. Immunoglobulin D (IgD) is found together with IgM as a major membrane-bound immunoglobulin on mature, immunocompetent but naïve (prior to antigen exposure) B cells, acting as the cellular receptor for antigen. IgG and IgM, when bound to self or microbial antigens, can activate the classical complement pathway, leading to a cascade of cytolytic and proinflammatory consequences.</div><div class="text" id="p0250">When circulating antibodies bind to antigens they form immune complexes. If present in abnormal quantities, these may cause pathological damage to the vascular system and other tissues, either by interfering mechanically with the permeability of the basal lamina (e.g. some types of glomerulonephritis), or by causing local activation of the complement system that generates inflammatory mediators (e.g. C5a), attacks cell membranes and causes vascular disease. In pregnancy, maternal IgG crosses the placenta and confers passive immunity on the fetus.

As recirculating cells, their major function is immune surveillance. Their activation and subsequent proliferation and functional maturation are under the control of APCs. T cells undertake a wide variety of cell-mediated defensive functions that are not directly dependent on antibody activity, and which constitute the basis of cellular immunity. T-cell responses focus on the destruction of cellular targets such as virus-infected cells, certain bacterial infections, fungi, some protozoal infections, neoplastic cells and the cells of grafts from other individuals (allografts, when the tissue antigens of the donor and recipient are not sufficiently similar). Targets may be killed directly by cytotoxic T cells, or indirectly by accessory cells (e.g. macrophages) that have been recruited and activated by cytokine-secreting helper T cells.

The majority of cytokine-secreting helper T cells express CD4, while cytotoxic T cells are characterized by CD8. Regulatory T cells co-express CD4 and CD25. The CD (cluster of differentiation) prefix provides a standard nomenclature for all cell-surface molecules.

Recognition of antigen, presented as a peptide fragment on MHC class I molecules, triggers the calcium-dependent release of lytic granules by the CTLs. These lysosome-like granules contain perforin (cytolysin), which forms a pore in the target cell membrane, very similar to the membrane attack complex generated at the end of complement activation. They also contain several different serine protease enzymes (granzymes), which enter the target cell via the perforin pore and induce programmed cell death (apoptosis; <a href="../B978070207705000001X/B978070207705000001X.xhtml#pg27">p. 27</a>) of the target.

Two major populations have been identified according to the range of cytokines produced. Th1 helper T cells (a part of cell-mediated adaptive immunity) typically secrete interleukin (IL)-2, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ). Th2 helper T cells (a part of humoral adaptive immunity) produce cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. These two CD4-expressing populations are termed Th cells because one aspect of their function is to help, i.e. stimulate, the proliferation and maturation of B lymphocytes and CTLs (mediated via cytokines such as IL-4, IL-2 and IFN-γ), thus enabling and enhancing the immune responses mediated by those cells. Th1 cells activate phagocytic cells via production of IFN-γ and TNF-α in order to eliminate pathogens. Macrophage activation by IFN-γ involves upregulation of MHC class II surface expression and enhancement of their antigen-capturing and presenting potency. IFN-γ also promotes the generation of specialized tumour necrosis factor/inducible nitric oxide synthase- (TNF/iNOS) producing dendritic cells, facilitating swift destruction of intracellular pathogens such as <span class="italic">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span>.</div><div class="text" id="p0285">Other subsets of helper T cells have been described.

Th17 cells are always present in small bowel tissues where they are likely to interact with commensal gut bacteria. Since Th17 cells bear IL-23 receptors, they can recruit neutrophils very quickly in response to IL-23 produced by activated macrophages. Further subsets (Th9, Th22) have been designated and many more subsets will likely be characterized in the future (<a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Jiang and Dong 2013</a>, <a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_13">Hirahara and Nakayama 2016</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0290">Th cells are important in directing the destruction of pathogens by recruiting accessory cells (e.g. macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils) to the site of infection and by activating their effector functions. This process is tightly coordinated. For example, Th1 helper T cells secrete cytokines that not only attract and activate macrophages but also provide help for B cells and guide their immunoglobulin production to the subclasses that fix complement. Thus, these antibodies opsonize the pathogen target, which can then be recognized, ingested and destroyed by the macrophage accessory cells that bear receptors for complement and the Fc region of IgG. These Th1 cells are sometimes referred to as delayed-type hypersensitivity T cells. In contrast, Th2 cells secrete cytokines that induce the development and activation of eosinophils, and also induce B cells to switch their immunoglobulins to non-complement-fixing classes (e.g. IgE). Pathogens such as parasitic worms can then be coated with IgE antibody and hence recognized and destroyed by the effector functions of the eosinophil accessory cells, which bear receptors for the Fc region of IgE.</div><div class="text" id="p0295">If helper T-cell activities are non-functional, a state of immunodeficiency results. This means that potentially pathogenic organisms, normally kept in check by the immune system, may proliferate and cause overt pathology, e.g. in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), where a virus (human immunodeficiency virus, HIV) specifically infects and kills (predominantly) helper T cells, though some APCs are also killed. Dysregulated Th1 immune responses can result in organ damage and autoimmune disease due to a sustained chronic inflammatory state.

Regulatory T cells (natural or central Tregs) are produced in the thymus and are an important additional mechanism for maintaining self-tolerance because their T cell receptors are directed in the thymus to recognize self-antigens (<a href="#bib46" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_46">Safinia et al 2015</a>). Treg function is antigen-specific and depends on direct cell–cell contact.

Similar regulatory T cells can be induced in the periphery by TGF-β (induced Tregs) and may be important in the induction of oral tolerance to ingested antigens, as well as tolerance to tissue-specific molecules that are not expressed in the thymus (<a href="#bib47" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_47">Schmitt and Williams 2013</a>).

Platelets are anucleate cell fragments, derived from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow.

When a blood vessel is damaged, platelets become activated, evert their membrane invaginations to form lamellipodia and filopodia, and aggregate at the site of injury, plugging the wound. They adhere to each other (agglutination) and to other tissues. Adhesion is a function of the thick platelet coat and is promoted by the release of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and calcium ions from the platelets in response to vessel injury. The contents of released α granules, together with factors released from the damaged tissues, initiate a complex sequence of chemical reactions in the blood plasma, which leads to the precipitation of insoluble fibrin filaments in a three-dimensional meshwork, the fibrin clot (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 4.1</a>). More platelets attach to the clot, inserting extensions of their surfaces, filopodia, deep into the spaces between the fibrin filaments, to which they adhere strongly. The platelets then contract (clot retraction) by actin–myosin interactions within their cytoplasm, thus concentrating the fibrin clot and pulling the walls of the blood vessel together, limiting any further leakage of blood. After repair of the vessel wall, which may be promoted by the mitogenic activity of PDGF, the clot is dissolved by enzymes such as plasmin, formed by plasminogen activators in the plasma, probably assisted by lysosomal enzymes derived from the γ granules of platelets. Platelets typically circulate for 10 days before they are removed, mainly by splenic macrophages.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0110"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0120">Lymphoid Tissues</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0340">Lymphocytes are located in many sites in the body, most obviously at strategic sites that are liable to infection, e.g. the oropharynx.

The B lymphocyte lineage develops through a series of differentiation stages within the bone marrow. The newly formed B cells then leave through the circulation and migrate to peripheral sites. In contrast, T-lymphocyte development requires the thymus; the bone marrow-derived stem cells must therefore migrate via the blood circulation to the thymus. After their differentiation and maturation into immunocompetent T cells that have survived thymic selection processes (1–3%), they re-enter the circulation and are transported to peripheral sites where they join the pool of naïve lymphocytes that recirculate through the secondary lymphoid organs via blood and lymphatic circulation systems.</div><div class="text" id="p0350">The secondary or peripheral lymphoid organs are the specialized sites where B and T lymphocytes and APCs come together to initiate immune responses to foreign antigens (<a href="#bib30" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_30">Malhotra et al 2013</a>). They include lymph nodes, spleen, and lymphoid tissue associated with epithelial surfaces (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, MALT), e.g. the palatine and nasopharyngeal tonsils, Peyer’s patches in the small intestine, lymphoid nodules in the respiratory and urogenital systems, the skin.

APCs (dendritic cells) enter via the lymphatics, bringing with them antigen from peripheral infected sites. In all the secondary tissues there are specific areas where either B or T cells are concentrated. After activation, functionally competent lymphocytes migrate to other sites in the body, where they combat the original infection.

Each cell type undergoes a period of maturation in the marrow, often accompanied by several structural changes, before release into the general circulation. In some lineages, e.g. the erythroid series, the final stages of maturation take place in the circulation, whereas in the monocytic lineage, they occur after the cells have left the circulation and entered peripheral tissues where they differentiate into macrophages and some dendritic cells.</div><div class="text" id="p0480">To generate a complete set of blood cells from a single pluripotent cell may take some months.

The first identifiable progenitor cell is the lymphoblast, which divides several times to form prolymphocytes; both cells are characterized by a high nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio. B cells undergo differentiation to their specific lineage subset entirely within the bone marrow and migrate to peripheral or secondary lymphoid tissues as naïve B cells, ready to respond to antigen.

Autoreactive cells that meet their self-antigen within the bone marrow are eliminated. Overall, some 25% of B cells successfully complete these developmental and selection processes; those that fail die by apoptosis and are removed by macrophages. Bone marrow stromal cells (fibroblasts, fat cells and macrophages) express cell-surface molecules and secrete cytokines that control B-lymphocyte development. The mature naïve B lymphocytes leave via the central sinuses. They express antigen receptors (immunoglobulin) of IgM and IgD classes.

They first migrate to the outer (subcapsular) region of the thymic cortex and then, as in the bone marrow, move progressively inwards towards the medulla as development continues. T-cell development involves gene rearrangements in the T-cell receptor (TcR) loci to create unique receptors for antigen on each cell, together with the progressive expression of molecules required for mature T-cell function. Selection of the receptor repertoire is more stringent for T cells than for B cells because of the way in which mature T cells recognize peptides derived from protein antigens presented in conjunction with specific molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expressed on the surfaces of cells. Thus mature CD8<sup>+</sup> (cytotoxic) T cells recognize antigen in the form of short peptides complexed with the polymorphic MHC class I molecules, while CD4<sup>+</sup> (helper/regulatory) T cells recognize the peptides in the context of MHC class II molecules. As the TcR recognizes both the peptide and the MHC molecule, the T cell will only recognize peptides bound to their own (self) type of MHC; it will not ‘see’ peptides in combination with allelically different MHC molecules (i.e. those from other individuals). This is termed MHC restriction of T-cell recognition. Selection of T cells in the thymus must ensure the survival of those T cells that can respond only to foreign antigens, bound to their own (self) class of MHC molecule. Cells that are incapable of binding to self MHC molecules, or which bind to self-antigens, are eliminated by apoptotic cell death; it is estimated that up to 95% of T-cell progenitors undergo apoptosis in this way. Cells that express an appropriate TcR and have effective MHC-restricted binding properties survive to become mature, naïve T cells that leave the thymus and populate the periphery.</div><div class="text" id="p0505">Thymic stromal cells play a crucial role in T-cell development and selection. Thymic epithelial cells in the cortex express both MHC class I and II molecules and are unique in their ability to select T cells that recognize self MHC with a moderate affinity (positive selection). Deletion of self-antigen reactive cells (negative selection) is mainly controlled by thymic dendritic cells located at the corticomedullary junction and in the medulla, although the epithelium can also perform this function. Apoptotic thymocytes are removed by thymic <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="81" id="pagebreak_81"/><a id="pg81"/>macrophages. The role of the thymic epithelium in thymocyte differentiation is complex and involves cell–cell contact as well as the secretion of soluble mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, neuroactive peptides (e.g. somatostatin) and thymic hormones (e.g. thymulin). Thymic fibroblasts and the extracellular matrix also play a role.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0200"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0210">Erythrocytes</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0510">Erythrocytes and granulocytes belong to the myeloid lineage. The earliest identifiable erythroid progenitor cells are capable of rapid bursts of cell division to form numerous daughter cells; they have thus been named burst-forming units of the erythroid line (BFU-E; see <a href="#f0090">Fig. 4.12</a>). They give rise to the CFU-E, which, with their immediate progeny, are sensitive to the hormone erythropoietin. This hormone, produced in the kidney, induces further differentiation along the erythroid line.</div><div class="text" id="p0515">The first readily identifiable cell of the erythroid series is the proerythroblast, which is a large cell (about 20<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm) with a large euchromatic nucleus and a moderately basophilic cytoplasm. It responds to erythropoietin. The proerythroblast contains small amounts of ferritin and bears some of the protein spectrin on the cytoplasmic surface of its plasma membrane. Proerythroblasts proliferate to produce smaller (12–16<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm) basophilic erythroblasts, rich in ribosomes, in which haemoglobin RNA synthesis begins.

Their nuclei become pyknotic (dense, deep-staining, shrunken) and are finally extruded, leaving anucleate reticulocytes, which enter sinusoids. Their reticular staining pattern, visible using special stains, is a consequence of residual cytoplasmic RNA, which is usually lost within 24 hours of entering the peripheral blood circulation: reticulocyte numbers in peripheral blood are therefore a good indicator of the rate of red cell production. The whole process of erythropoiesis takes 5–9 days.</div></section><section><a id="s0205"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0215">Granulocytes</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0520">Granulocyte formation involves major changes in nuclear morphology and cytoplasmic contents, which are best known for the neutrophil.

Smaller secondary (specific) granules are formed in the smaller myelocyte, which is the final proliferative stage. Myelocyte nuclei are typically flattened or slightly indented on one side.</div><div class="text" id="p0525">The next stage produces a metamyelocyte: the cell size decreases (10–15<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm), the nucleus becomes heterochromatic and horseshoe-shaped, and protein synthesis almost stops. As the neutrophil is released, the nucleus becomes first heavily indented (the juvenile stab or band form), and subsequently segmented into up to six lobes, characteristic of the mature neutrophil. The whole process usually takes 7 days to complete (3 days proliferating and 4 days maturing). Neutrophils may then be stored in the marrow for a further 4 days, depending on demand, before their final release into the circulation.</div><div class="text" id="p0530">Eosinophils and basophils pass through a similar sequence but their nuclei do not become as irregular as that of the neutrophil.

Monocytes and neutrophils appear to be closely related cells: together with some of the antigen-presenting dendritic cells, they arise from a shared progenitor, the colony-forming unit for granulocytes and macrophages (CFU-GM). Different colony-stimulating factors (CSF) act on the common progenitor to direct its subsequent differentiation pathway. Monocyte progenitors pass through a proliferative monoblast stage (14<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm) and then form differentiating promonocytes, which are slightly smaller cells in which production of small lysosomes begins.

Certain dendritic cells (see <a href="#f0090">Fig. 4.12</a>), e.g. Langerhans cells of the skin and other stratified squamous epithelia, are ‘professional’ antigen-presenting cells (APCs); they take up foreign material by endocytosis and macropinocytosis, and are uniquely capable of efficiently activating naïve as well as mature T lymphocytes. Macrophages are able to process and present antigen to lymphocytes, but are less effective than dendritic cells. They also play an important role in the effector arm of the immune response, clearing the infectious agent by phagocytosis. The third major cell type involved in antigen presentation and T-cell activation is the B lymphocyte, which is particularly efficient at taking up antigen that binds to its surface immunoglobulin. Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) of lymph nodes, MALT and the spleen are capable of presenting non-processed antigen to B lymphocytes, but are not classic APCs because they cannot present antigen to helper T cells.</div><div class="text" id="p0555">APCs endocytose antigen, digest it intracellularly, mostly to peptide fragments, and present the fragments on their surfaces, generally in conjunction with MHC class II molecules. (Class II molecules are normally found only on APCs, although many other cells can express class II molecules in inflammatory situations.) Recognition of foreign antigen is controlled by a variety of APC cell-surface receptors: Fc and complement receptors mediate uptake of opsonized material, while pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system, e.g. Toll-like receptors and scavenger receptors, directly recognize pathogen-derived molecules.</div><section><a id="s0225"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0235">Macrophages</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0560">The mononuclear phagocyte system consists of the blood monocytes, from which the other types are derived, and various tissue macrophages, some of which have tissue-specific names. Certain dendritic cells are <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="82" id="pagebreak_82"/><a id="pg82"/>sometimes included in the mononuclear phagocyte system;: they share a common lineage ancestor but appear to form a discrete branch of the family tree. Most monocytes and macrophages express class II MHC molecules.</div><div class="text" id="p0565">Macrophages are very variable in size (generally 15–25<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm) and are found in many tissues of the body, where they constitute a heterogeneous family of cells (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">Gordon and Taylor 2005</a>). They are migrant cells in all general connective tissues, in bone marrow and all lymphoid tissues, and include alveolar macrophages in the lung and Kupffer cells in liver sinusoids. They often aggregate in subserous connective tissue of the pleura and peritoneum, where they are visible as milky spots near small lymphatic trunks, and cluster around the terminations of small (penicillar) arterioles in the spleen, where they are also distributed, more diffusely, throughout the splenic cords.</div><div class="text" id="p0570">Osteoclasts in bone are closely related to macrophages; they are syncytial cells derived from the fusion of up to 30 progenitor monocytes in bone tissue, where they differentiate further. Microglia of the central nervous system originate from an embryonic monocyte precursor and migrate into the central nervous system during its development. They differ from macrophages in that normally they are quiescent cells in which MHC class II expression is downregulated, and they display little phagocytic activity.</div><div class="text" id="p0575">Macrophages vary in structure depending on their location in the body. All have a moderately basophilic cytoplasm containing some rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, an active Golgi complex and a large, euchromatic and somewhat irregular nucleus. These features are consistent with an active metabolism: synthesis of lysosomal enzymes continues in mature cells. All macrophages have irregular surfaces with protruding filopodia and they contain varying numbers of endocytic vesicles, larger vacuoles and lysosomes. Some macrophages are highly motile, whereas others tend to remain attached and sedentary, e.g. in hepatic and lymphoid sinuses. Within connective tissues, macrophages may fuse to form large syncytia (giant cells) around particles that are too large to be phagocytosed, or when stimulated by the presence of infectious organisms, e.g. <span class="italic">Mycobacterium tuberculosis, leading to granuloma formation.</span></div><div class="text" id="p0580">When blood-borne monocytes enter the tissues through the endothelial walls of capillaries and venules, they can undergo a limited number of rounds of mitosis as tissue macrophages before they die and are replaced from the bone marrow, typically after several weeks. There is some evidence that alveolar macrophages of the lung are able to undergo many more mitoses than other macrophages.</div><section><a id="s0230"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0240">Phagocytosis</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0585">The uptake of particulate material and microorganisms is carried out by macrophages in many tissues and organs. When present in general connective tissues, they ingest and kill invading microorganisms and remove debris that has been produced as a consequence of tissue damage. They recognize, engulf and rapidly ingest apoptotic cells in all situations. The mechanism of apoptotic cell uptake does not activate the phagocyte for antigen presentation, and so the process is immunologically silent. In the lung, alveolar macrophages constantly patrol the respiratory surfaces, to which they migrate from pulmonary connective tissue (<a href="#f0070"><span class="bold">Fig. 4.13</span></a>). They engulf inhaled particles, including bacteria, surfactant and debris, and many enter the sputum (hence their alternative names, dust cells or, in patients with left heart failure or chronic pulmonary oedema, heart failure cells, which are full of extravasated erythrocytes). They perform similar scavenger functions in the pleural and peritoneal cavities. In lymph nodes, macrophages line the walls of sinuses and remove particulate matter from lymph as it percolates through them. In the spleen and liver, macrophages are involved in particle removal and in the detection and destruction of aged or damaged erythrocytes. They begin the degradation of haemoglobin for recycling iron and amino acids.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0070"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000045/main.assets/f04-13-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0070"/><a id="fspara0070"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 4.13</span> Alveolar macrophages (dust cells, arrows) containing ingested carbon particles, in alveoli and interalveolar septa of the human lung. <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Mr Peter Helliwell and the late Dr Joseph Mathew, Department of Histopathology, Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, UK.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0590">Phagocytes recognize molecular patterns on the pathogen surface (pathogen-associated molecular patterns, PAMPs) via their PAMP-recognising receptors (PRRs).

Phagocytic activity is greatly increased when the target has been coated in antibody (opsonized) or complement, or both.

These activities are much enhanced when macrophages are stimulated (activated macrophages) by cytokines, e.g. IFN-γ, which are secreted by other cells of the immune system, especially T lymphocytes.</div><div class="text" id="p0600">Close antibody-mediated binding may initiate the release of lysosomal enzymes onto the surfaces of the cellular targets to which the macrophages bind.

They also synthesize TNF-α, which is able to kill small numbers of neoplastic cells. TNF-α depresses the anabolic activities of many cells in the body, and may be a major factor mediating cachexia (wasting), which typically accompanies more advanced cancers. Other macrophage products include plasminogen activator, which promotes clot removal; various lysosomal enzymes; several complement and clotting factors; and lysozyme (an antibacterial protein). In pathogenesis, these substances may be released inappropriately and damage healthy tissues, e.g. in rheumatoid arthritis and various other inflammatory conditions.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0240"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0250">Dendritic cells</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0615">There are two distinct groups of dendritic cells: myeloid dendritic cells (also known as classic dendritic cells) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (<a href="#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Liu 2001</a>, <a href="#bib35" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_35">Merad et al 2013</a>, <a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Gerlach et al 2013</a>).
