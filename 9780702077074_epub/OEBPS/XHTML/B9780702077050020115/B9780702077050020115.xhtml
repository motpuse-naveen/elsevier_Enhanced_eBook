Conventionally, it is divided into topographical (macroscopic or gross) anatomy (which may be further divided into regional anatomy, surface anatomy, neuroanatomy, endoscopic and imaging anatomy); developmental anatomy (embryogenesis and subsequent organogenesis); and the anatomy of microscopic and submicroscopic structure (histology).</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0015">Anatomical language is one of the fundamental languages of medicine. The unambiguous description of thousands of structures is impossible without an extensive and often highly specialized vocabulary. Ideally, these terms, which are often derived from Latin or Greek, should be used to the exclusion of any other, and eponyms should be avoided. In reality, this does not always happen. Many terms are vernacularized and, around the world, synonyms and eponyms still abound in the literature, in medical undergraduate classrooms and in clinics and operating theatres. The 2nd edition of the <span class="italic">Terminologia Anatomica</span>,<a href="#fn1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="cfn1"><sup>1</sup></a> drawn up by the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology (FCAT) and newly published in 2019, continues to serve as our reference source for the terminology for macroscopic anatomy, and the text of the 42nd edition of <span class="italic">Gray’s Anatomy</span> is almost entirely TA2-compliant. However, where terminology is at variance with, or, more likely, is not included in, the TA, the alternative term used either is cited in the relevant consensus document or position paper, or enjoys widespread clinical usage. Synonyms and eponyms are given in parentheses on first usage of a preferred term and not shown thereafter in the text; an updated list of eponyms and short biographical details of the clinicians and anatomists whose names are used in this way is available in the e-book for reference purposes (see Preface, p. ix, for further discussion of the use of eponyms).</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0020">When medical students begin dissection classes they are often surprised by the range of anatomical variation that they encounter amongst the cadavers in the laboratory. As they progress to clinical examination and study their patients’ X-ray, CT, MRI or ultrasound images, they encounter further variations that prompt the age-old question, ‘what is normal, and what is beyond the range of anatomical normality?’ The interested reader is directed to <span class="italic">Bergman’s Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Human Anatomic Variation</span>, which ‘attempts to capture many of the known variants of the human form’.<a href="#fn2" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="cfn2"><sup>2</sup></a></div><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0010">Planes, Directions and Relationships</h2><div class="para_fl" id="p0025">To avoid ambiguity, all anatomical descriptions assume that the body is in the conventional ‘anatomical position’, i.e. standing erect and facing forwards, upper limbs by the side with the palms facing forwards, and lower limbs together with the toes facing forwards (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 1</span></a>). Descriptions are based on four imaginary planes – median, sagittal, coronal and horizontal – applied to a body in the anatomical position. The median plane passes longitudinally through the body and divides it into right and left halves. The sagittal plane is any vertical plane parallel with the median plane; although often employed, ‘parasagittal’ is therefore redundant and should not be used. The coronal (frontal) plane is orthogonal to the median plane and divides the body into anterior (front) and posterior (back). The horizontal (transverse) plane is orthogonal to both median and sagittal planes. Radiologists refer to transverse planes as (trans)axial; convention dictates that axial anatomy is viewed as though looking from the feet towards the head.</div><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="xvii" id="pagebreak_xvii"/></div><section><a id="sf0010"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050020115/main.assets/fm01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 1</span> The terminology widely used in descriptive anatomy.

Medial and lateral indicate closeness to the median plane, medial being closer than lateral; in the anatomical position, the little finger is medial to the thumb, and the great toe is medial to the little toe. Specialized terms may also be used to indicate medial and lateral. Thus, in the upper limb, ulnar and radial are used to mean medial and lateral, respectively; in the lower limb, tibial and fibular (peroneal) are used to mean medial and lateral, respectively. Terms may be based on embryological relationships; the border of the upper limb that includes the thumb, and the border of the lower limb that includes the great toe are the pre-axial borders, whilst the opposite borders are the post-axial borders. Various degrees of obliquity are acknowledged using compound terms, e.g. posterolateral.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0035">When referring to structures in the trunk and upper limb, we have freely used the synonyms anterior, ventral, flexor, palmar and volar, and posterior, dorsal and extensor. We recognize that these synonyms are not always satisfactory, e.g. the extensor aspect of the leg is anterior with respect to the knee and ankle joints, and superior in the foot and digits; the plantar (flexor) aspect of the foot is inferior. Dorsal (dorsum) and ventral are terms used particularly by embryologists and neuroanatomists; they therefore feature most often in Sections 2 and 3.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0040">Distal and proximal are used particularly to describe structures in the limbs, taking the datum point as the attachment of the limb to the trunk (sometimes referred to as the root), such that a proximal structure is closer to the attachment of the limb than a distal structure. However, proximal and distal are also used in describing branching structures, e.g. bronchi, vessels and nerves. External (outer) and internal (inner) refer to the distance from the centre of an organ or cavity, e.g. the layers of the body wall, or the cortex and medulla of the kidney. External and internal can also describe rotation that is lateral or medial, respectively, e.g. at the hip or shoulder joints. Superficial and deep are used to describe the relationships between adjacent structures. Ipsilateral refers to the same side (of the body, organ or structure), bilateral to both sides, and contralateral to the opposite side.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0045">Teeth are described using specific terms that indicate their relationship to their neighbours and to their position within the dental arch; these terms are described on <a href="../B9780702077050000379/B9780702077050000379.xhtml#pagebreak_646">page 646</a>.</div></section></section><footer><section epub:type="footnotes"><div class="ftnote"><hr/><p class="ftnote1" id="fn1" role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote"><sup><a href="#cfn1">1</a></sup> <a id="ntpara0010"/><span class="italic">Terminologia Anatomica 2</span> (2019) is the joint creation of the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology (FCAT) and the Member Associations of the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists (IFAA).</p><p class="ftnote1" id="fn2" role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote"><sup><a href="#cfn2">2</a></sup> <a id="ntpara0015"/>Tubbs RS, Shoja MM, Loukas M 2016 Bergman’s Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Human Anatomic Variation.
