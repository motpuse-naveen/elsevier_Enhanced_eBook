The pericardium is continuous superiorly with the adventitia of the great vessels and the pretracheal fascia, inferiorly it is attached to the central diaphragmatic tendon and a small adjacent muscular area to its left, and anteriorly it is attached to the posterior sternal surface via the superior and inferior sternopericardial ligaments (the extent of these ligaments is variable, and the superior is often undetectable).</div><div class="text" id="p0035">Anteriorly, the fibrous pericardium is almost completely separated from the thoracic wall by the costomediastinal recess of the parietal pleura and the lungs during inspiration (see <a href="#f0125">Fig. 53.4B</a>). However, in a small area posterior to the lower left half of the body of the sternum and the sternal ends of left fourth and fifth costal cartilages, the pericardium is in direct contact with the thoracic wall, and, until it regresses during early adulthood, the inferior extent of the thymus is anterior to the superior part of the pericardium. The main bronchi, oesophagus, descending thoracic aorta and posterior parts of the mediastinal surface of both lungs are all posterior relations. Laterally, the mediastinal parts of the parietal pleurae cover the mediastinal surfaces of the lungs. The phrenic nerve and pericardiacophrenic vasculature descend on each side between the fibrous pericardium and mediastinal part of the parietal pleura (see <a href="../B9780702077050000562/B9780702077050000562.xhtml#f0035">Fig. 56.7</a>). Inferiorly, the pericardium is separated from the liver and gastric fundus by the respiratory diaphragm and the diaphragmatic fascia and parietal peritoneum covering its inferior (abdominal) surface.

It has visceral and parietal layers. The parietal layer lines the internal surface of the fibrous pericardium. The visceral layer, or epicardium, covers the heart and great vessels, and at specific points folds back on itself (reflects) to become continuous with the parietal layer (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 57.1</a>). The visceral layer of serous pericardium is a single layer composed of ciliated mesothelial cells supported on a thin subserosal layer of connective tissue rich in elastic fibres. The serosal cilia increase the surface area for fluid production and resorption, and reduce friction between the opposing pericardial layers. The visceral layer blends with interstitial myocardial tissue. The cardiac subserosal layer contains fat, especially along the ventricular side of the atrioventricular and interventricular sulci (grooves) and the inferior cardiac border. The main coronary vessels and their larger branches are embedded in this fat; the amount is related to the general extent of body fat and gradually increases with age. The anterior cardiophrenic angles typically possess increased epipericardial fat, which can be mistakenly identified as an abnormal mass on imaging (<a href="#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_41">Rodriguez and Tan 2017b</a>). The amount of epicardial adipose tissue may be a cardiometabolic risk factor, with increasing thickness linked to metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus. A significant correlation has been demonstrated between obesity in children and the thickness of this fat layer (<a href="#bib37" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_37">Ozdemir et al 2010</a>).</div><section><a id="s0030"/><section><a id="s0035"/><section><a id="s0040"/><section><a id="s0045"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0040">Pericardial reflections and sinuses</p><div class="textfl" id="p0055">The points of reflection of the serous pericardium around the great veins and arteries of the heart are arranged as two complex pericardial tubes that enclose the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk and the venae cavae and four pulmonary veins.

The postcaval recess projects from the main pericardial cavity towards the left behind the atrial termination of the superior vena cava: it is limited superiorly by the right pulmonary artery and inferiorly by the right superior pulmonary vein, its entrance facing superolaterally and to the right. The right and left pulmonary venous recesses each project superomedially on the posterior surface of the left atrium, between the superior and inferior pulmonary veins on each side, indenting the side walls of the oblique pericardial sinus. The left pulmonary recess has an entrance under the fold of the oblique vein of the left atrium and passes to the left between the inferior aspect of the left pulmonary artery and the superior border of the left superior pulmonary vein. The right pulmonary recess lies between the inferior surface of the proximal part of the right pulmonary artery and the superior border of the left atrium. The superior aortic recess ascends from the transverse pericardial sinus, initially posterior to, and then to the right of, the ascending aorta, ending around the level of the sternal angle. The inferior aortic recess also extends from the transverse pericardial sinus, descending from a superiorly located entrance to run between the inferior part of the ascending aorta and the right atrium.</div><div class="text" id="p0065">A triangular fold of serous pericardium reflected from the left pulmonary artery to the inferiorly located left superior pulmonary vein marks the site of the left common cardinal vein during development. It contains a fibrous ligament, a remnant of the left common cardinal vein (left duct of Cuvier) that is usually obliterated during development. This ligament descends anterior to the hilum of the left lung from the superior part of the left superior intercostal vein to the posterior surface of the left atrium, where it is continuous with the oblique vein of the left atrium. The left common cardinal vein may persist sometimes as a left superior vena cava: when present, it replaces the oblique vein of the left atrium and empties into the right atrium through the coronary sinus. When both common cardinal veins persist as a double superior vena cava, the transverse anastomosis between them that normally forms the left brachiocephalic vein may be small or absent. A left superior vena cava is normally joined by the left superior intercostal vein. Knowledge of these recesses and sinuses is important in the avoidance of misdiagnosis of lymphadenopathy or aortic dissection, and in surgical control of the great vessels.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0050"/><h5 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0045">Pericardial cavity and fluid</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0070">The pericardial cavity is the space between the parietal and visceral layers of the serous pericardium.

Inferiorly, the pericardium is supplied by small branches from the intercostal and superior phrenic arteries. The posterior part of the pericardium is supplied from small mediastinal branches that are derived either directly from the descending thoracic aorta or from its oesophageal or bronchial branches.

The developed lymphatic network of the heart traverses all its layers, including those of the atria and ventricles and extends to the mitral valve.

There are two layers of pericardial lymphatic vessels, contacting and surrounding the parietal pericardium and also within the fat and loose areolar tissue. The anterior (sternocostal) part of the pericardium either drains laterally towards the phrenic nerves as they enter the diaphragm (lateral group of diaphragmatic nodes, superior phrenic nodes), or travels along the ventral border of the pericardium to enter the prepericardial lymph nodes located at the pericardio-diaphragmatic junction. Drainage from the lateral pericardium is more variable. Inferiorly, it drains towards the phrenic nerves and the pericardiacophrenic vessels as they reach the respiratory diaphragm, and includes the lateral pericardial nodes; superiorly, it drains into the tracheobronchial (subcarinal) and paratracheal lymph nodes. The posterior pericardium, including the posterior aspect of the associated dome of the respiratory diaphragm and extending as far as the pulmonary veins, drains superiorly to the superior and inferior tracheobronchial (upper and lower paratracheal, and subcarinal) lymph nodes. The portion of the pericardium that adheres to the diaphragm drains via short channels to the lymph nodes at the right border of the caval foramen in the central diaphragmatic tendon.</div><div class="text" id="p0085">Lymphangiogenesis, the formation of new lymphatic vessels, is beneficial in delaying atherosclerotic plaque formation in coronary arteries.

Pain from the visceral layer of serous pericardium is transmitted along visceral afferent fibres that travel via sympathetic nerves that arise from the cervical, upper thoracic and stellate ganglia and travel to the aortic and cardiac plexuses. The pericardium is also innervated by vagal fibres via the oesophageal plexus and left recurrent laryngeal nerve (see <a href="#f0110">Fig. 57.61</a>). Pericardial pain (somatic) is typically sharp, severe and substernal, often exacerbated when lying in the supine or left lateral position and relieved by leaning forwards; it occasionally radiates to the superior border of trapezius.</div></section><section><a id="s0065"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0060">Cardiac tamponade</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0100">Cardiac tamponade is external compression of the heart, usually caused by accumulation of fluid in the pericardial cavity (pericardial effusion) (<a href="#f0135"><span class="bold">Fig. 57.5</span></a>). This causes compression of the right atrium, reducing venous return and therefore reducing cardiac output. It may be secondary to trauma, proximal extension of a dissecting aortic aneurysm, cardiac surgery or central venous catheter insertion. A patient with cardiac tamponade will develop hypotension, chest tightness, dyspnoea and, possibly, a form of cardiogenic shock. The typical signs of a cardiac tamponade include three elements (Beck’s triad): a small quiet heart (due to fluid within the pericardial cavity), falling atrial pressure (decreased stroke volume) and rising jugular venous pressure (impaired cardiac venous return). Emergency treatment involves first relieving the tamponade by percutaneous pericardial aspiration (pericardiocentesis), possibly followed by surgery to address the underlying cause. The volume of fluid may not be proportional to the degree of physiological circulatory impairment. A rapid increase in fluid volume within the pericardial cavity is more likely to cause cardiac tamponade than an increase that accumulates over a longer period of time. Echocardiography is an important tool for diagnosis and guiding subsequent percutaneous pericardial aspiration. Surgery is via a subxiphoid incision or a left anterior thoracotomy.</div><div id="p0105"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0135"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000574/main.assets/on57-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0135"/><a id="fspara0140"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 57.5</span> Acute cardiac tamponade in a 22-year-old patient following a motor vehicle collision.

Ultrasound-guided parasternal pericardiocentesis has become the preferred elective procedure.

Failure of pericardial development may be a consequence of premature atrophy of the cardinal vein and hence poor nourishment of the left pleuropericardial membrane. The most common defect is complete absence of the left side of the pericardium. When this occurs, lung tissue is interposed between the pulmonary trunk and ascending aorta. Bulging of the left atrial auricle through the defect will cause ischaemic necrosis and compression of the left coronary artery, and a rotation of the heart to the left.

Historically, established anatomical orientation terms that have been applied to the heart were based on early embryological development before axial rotation of the heart tube (i.e. left and right sides). This, together with the traditional study of isolated whole or dissected hearts outside the body, hinders the intuitive understanding of the descriptive relations of <span class="italic">in vivo</span> and surface anatomy. The following description emphasizes such difficulties in order to circumvent certain misconceptions, before proceeding to an account of more detailed structure. The oblique position of the heart in the thorax may be conceptualized by comparing it to a deformed pyramid, with the base facing posteriorly and to the right, and the apex anteriorly and to the left. A line from the apex to the approximate centre of the base projected posterolaterally emerges near the right scapular line. Some surfaces of the cardiac ‘pyramid’ are flat and others relatively convex. The surfaces merge along rather ill-defined borders. Precise definitions of surfaces and intervening borders are therefore difficult. In the account that follows, terms from <span class="italic">Terminologia Anatomica</span> (2019) are used and more generally used terms from clinical practice are given as alternatives.</div><div class="text" id="p0170">The heart is described as having a base and apex; its surfaces are designated as anterior (sternocostal), inferior (diaphragmatic), and right and left pulmonary (<a href="#f0155"><span class="bold">Fig. 57.9</span></a>). Its borders are termed upper, inferior (acute margin or border), right and left (obtuse margin or border). The right pulmonary surface is sometimes referred to as a border, despite its extent. Although the heart is placed obliquely in the thorax, the atrial and ventricular septal structures are virtually in line, and inclined anteriorly and to the left at around 45° to the sagittal plane. The planes of the mitral and tricuspid valves are near vertical and not precisely co-planar; they are broadly at right-angles to the septal plane. The right atrium, therefore, is not only to the right, but also anterior and inferior to the left atrium, and it is partly anterior to the left ventricle. The right ventricle forms most of <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1072" id="pagebreak_1072"/><a id="pg1072"/>the anterior aspect of the ventricular mass (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 57.1B</a>). Only its inferior end lies to the right of the left ventricle, while its upper extremity, supporting the pulmonary valve, is to the left of the left ventricle and superior to the level of the aortic valve (<a href="#f0125">Fig. 57.10</a>). The left atrium forms most of the posterior aspect of the heart, whereas the left ventricle is only prominent inferiorly, running along the left border to reach the cardiac apex. Each atrium is essentially to the right of and posterior to its respective ventricle. These general dispositions are of the greatest importance in planning or interpreting radiographs, CT and MRI studies, cardiac angiograms and echocardiograms (see <a href="#f0230">Fig. 57.32</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0175"><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0155"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000574/main.assets/f57-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0155"/><a id="fspara0160"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 57.9</span> The surfaces and borders of the heart. <span class="bold">A</span>, View of the anterior surface. <span class="bold">B</span>, View of the basal, inferior and pulmonary surfaces. <br/><span class="figcredit">Adapted from Drake RL, Vogl AW, Mitchell A et al (eds) Gray’s Atlas of Anatomy, 2nd ed.

Thus, the right heart forms the largest part of the anterior surface, its outflow tract ascending until it terminates on the left side of the outflow tract from the left ventricle. The sites of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves are widely separated and on different planes, and the sectionally crescentic flat cavity of the right ventricle splays out between them (see <a href="#f0030">Figs 57.18B</a>, <a href="#f0215">57.27A</a>). Conversely, the left heart (except the left-sided strip mentioned above) is largely posterior in position and, when viewed from the front (anteriorly), is obscured by the chambers of the right heart. The inlet to the left ventricle, which contains the mitral valve, is very close to its outlet (the aortic valve), the two being embraced by the wide tract linking the inlet and outlet parts of the right ventricle (see <a href="#f0075">Fig. 57.36</a>). The planes of the left ventricular orifices, although relatively inclined, are more nearly co-planar than those of the right (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 57.19</a>).

In cardiological and older anatomical texts, this artery is described as being posterior and descending, whereas three-dimensional reconstruction of cross-sectional imaging of adults clearly demonstrates that the artery occupies the inferior interventricular sulcus on the inferior surface of the heart, and is not posterior to the anterior interventricular artery: it can be described as posterior and descending only when using the ‘Valentine’ position, with the heart removed from the body and positioned standing on its apex (<a href="#bib33" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_33">Mori et al 2019</a>). In life, the posterior interventricular sulcus is situated inferiorly rather than posteriorly: blockage of the inferior (posterior) interventricular artery can produce inferior myocardial infarction. Another example is the papillary muscles that support the leaflets of the mitral valve. These were conventionally described as being anterolateral and posteroseptal, reflecting the fact that the heart was placed on its apex (Valentine position) in order to describe its component parts. However, when examined in left anterior oblique orientation, the posteroseptal muscle is anterior and inferior to its partner, despite the fact that the latter is conventionally described as anterolateral (see <a href="#f0125">Figs 57.4</a>, <a href="#f0155">57.9</a>, <a href="#f0015">57.10</a>, <a href="#f0215">57.27A</a>).</div><section><a id="s0100"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0090">General organization</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0200">The heart is a fused pair of valve-containing muscular pumps circulating blood in series through systemic (left heart) and pulmonary (right <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1073" id="pagebreak_1073"/>heart) circulations (see <a href="#f0125">Fig. 57.4</a>). The fibromuscular framework and conduction tissues of these physiologically separate pumps are structurally interwoven. Despite the functional disposition in series, the two pumps are topographically described in parallel. Of the four cardiac chambers, the two atria receive venous blood and serve as weakly contractile reservoirs for final filling of the two ventricles, which then provide the powerful expulsive contraction that forces blood into the main arterial trunks.</div><div class="text" id="p0205">The right heart starts at the right atrium, which receives the superior and inferior venae cavae and the main myocardial venous inflow via the coronary sinus. The systemic venous blood traverses the right atrioventricular orifice, guarded by the tricuspid (right atrioventricular) valve, to enter the inlet part of the right ventricle. Contraction of the ventricle, particularly its apical trabecular part, closes the tricuspid valve and, with increasing pressure, ejects the blood through the muscular right ventricular outflow tract into the pulmonary trunk and then through the relatively low-resistance pulmonary vascular bed. Many structural features of the right heart, including its overall geometry, myocardial architecture and the construction and relative strengths of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves, accord with this low resistance and comparatively low changes in pressure.</div><div class="text" id="p0210">The left heart starts at the left atrium, which receives all the pulmonary inflow of oxygenated blood and some coronary venous inflow. It contracts to fill the left ventricle through the left atrioventricular orifice, guarded by its mitral (left atrioventricular) valve. Left ventricular contraction rapidly increases the pressure in the apical trabecular part, closing the mitral valve and opening the aortic valve, enabling the ventricle to eject via the left ventricular outflow tract into the aortic sinuses, ascending aorta, and the entire systemic arterial tree, including the coronary arteries. This vast vascular bed presents a high peripheral resistance that, with large metabolic demands (especially the sustained requirements of the cerebral tissues), explains the relatively massive structural organization of the left heart. The ejection phase of the left ventricle is shorter than that of the right but its fluctuations in pressure are much greater. The heart is, therefore, a functionally and structurally asymmetric pair of combined pumps in which both ventricles are designed to deliver the same volume with each contraction into two very different resistive series circulations.</div><section><a id="s0105"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0095">Cardiac size, shape and external features</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0215">The heart is a hollow, fibromuscular organ of a somewhat conical or pyramidal form, with a base, apex and a series of surfaces and borders (margins) (see <a href="#f0155">Fig. 57.9</a>).

Others are less distinct or barely perceptible, and are sometimes obscured, in part, by the major structures that cross or traverse them.</div><div class="text" id="p0225">The extensive interatrial sulcus (of Waterston) separates the two atria. The lateral limits are defined by the borders of the atria. The atrioventricular (coronary) sulcus separates the atria from the ventricles and contains the main parts of the right and circumflex coronary arteries. It descends obliquely to the right on the anterior (sternocostal) surface, separating the right atrium and its auricle (appendage) from the obliquely oriented right margin of the right ventricle and its conus arteriosus (infundibulum). Superiorly, it is obliterated by the crossing of the pulmonary trunk, and posterior to this, the ascending aorta from which the coronary arteries originate. Continuing to the left, the atrioventricular sulcus curves around the left border (obtuse margin) and descends to the right, separating the atrial base from the inferior surface of the ventricles (see <a href="#f0125">Fig. 57.4</a>). This inferior part of the atrioventricular sulcus then curves around the inferior border (acute margin) at its lower right end to become confluent with the anterior part of the sulcus. The inferior part of the sulcus sits slightly to the left of the anterior part. A section of the heart through the plane of the atrioventricular sulcus is at about 45° to the sagittal plane and at a variable angle to the transverse and coronal planes. It approximately traverses the lines of attachment of the atrioventricular valves and, even less precisely, those of the aortic and pulmonary valves. A line at right-angles to the centre of this plane will descend anteriorly and leftwards to the cardiac apex. Internally, the ventricles are separated by the interventricular septum; its margins correspond to the anterior and inferior interventricular sulci. The anterior sulcus, seen on the anterior cardiac surface, is near and almost parallel to the left border (obtuse margin). On the inferior surface, the inferior interventricular sulcus is closer to the midpoint of the ventricular mass. The interventricular sulci extend from the atrioventricular sulcus to the notch of the cardiac apex on the inferior border (acute margin), the latter a little to the right of the cardiac apex (see <a href="#f0205">Fig. 57.24</a>).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0115"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0105">Cardiac base, apex, surfaces and borders</h4><section><a id="s0120"/><section><a id="s0125"/><section><a id="s0130"/><section><a id="s0135"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0110">Posterior surface (base) of the heart</p><div class="textfl" id="p0230">The true cardiac base is somewhat quadrilateral, with curved lateral extensions (see <a href="#f0155">Fig. 57.9</a>). It faces posteriorly and to the right, separated from the bodies of the thoracic vertebrae (fifth to eighth when supine, sixth to ninth in the erect position) and their intervening intervertebral discs by the pericardium, right pulmonary veins, oesophagus, azygos venous system, thoracic duct and descending thoracic aorta. It is formed mainly by the left atrium, and only partly by the posterior part of the right atrium (see <a href="#f0125">Fig. 57.4B</a>). It extends superiorly to the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk and inferiorly to the inferior part of the atrioventricular sulcus, which contains the coronary sinus and coronary arterial branches. It is limited to the right and left by the rounded surfaces of the corresponding atria. The junction of the atrioventricular, interatrial and inferior interventricular sulci is termed the cardiac crux. Two pulmonary veins on each side open into the left atrial part of the base, whereas the superior and the inferior venae cavae open into the respective parts of the right atrial basal region (see <a href="#f0125">Fig. 57.4B</a>). The area of the left atrial wall between the openings of right and left pulmonary veins forms the anterior wall of the oblique pericardial sinus (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 57.1</a>). This description of the anatomical base reflects the usual position of the heart in the thorax. Some confusion is produced by other current usages of the term ‘base’, often applied to the segment of the atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial junctions seen after dissections through the atrioventricular sulcus. This area is better termed the base of the ventricles. In clinical practice, auscultation in or near the parasternal parts of the second intercostal spaces is often described as occurring at the ‘clinical base’, to make a distinction with the ‘clinical apex’.

It is often guarded by a thin, semicircular Thebesian valve (valve of the coronary sinus) that covers the lower part of the orifice. The upper limb of this valve joins the valve of the inferior vena cava and its muscular extension, the Eustachian ridge. It also joins a tendinous structure (tendon of Todaro or tendon of the inferior pyramidal space) running from this commissure into the sinus septum between the coronary sinus and the fossa ovalis. The tendon of Todaro runs forwards to insert into the central fibrous body and forms one of the borders of the triangle of Koch (triangle of the atrioventricular node). The opening of the coronary sinus forms a prominent landmark in the right atrium. The coronary sinus itself lies within the posterior and inferior parts of the atrioventricular sulcus (see <a href="#f0125">Figs 57.4B,D,E</a>) and is the conduit for the return of most of the venous blood from the heart, although some veins drain directly into the atrial chambers. The coronary sinus starts at the confluence of the oblique vein of the left atrium and the great cardiac vein, and receives the middle and small cardiac veins close to its junction with the right atrium. Several small venous openings, draining the smallest cardiac (Thebesian) veins, are found scattered around the atrial walls. They return a small fraction of blood from the heart, and are most numerous on the septal aspect. The anterior cardiac veins and, sometimes, the right marginal vein may enter the atrium through larger openings.</div><div class="text" id="p0335">The right atrium and its auricle are separated from the systemic venous part by the crista terminalis, a smooth, C-shaped muscular ridge that originates from the upper part of the septal surface, passes anterior to the orifice of the superior vena cava and then skirts the right margin of the inner atrium to reach the right side of the orifice of the inferior vena cava. It marks the site of the right venous valve of the embryonic heart, corresponding externally to the sulcus terminalis. The sinu-atrial node is located in the superior part of the sulcus (groove), inferolateral to the orifice of the superior vena cava (see <a href="#f0170">Fig. 57.13</a>). The mean length of the crista terminalis is 51±9<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm and its thickness from epicardium to endocardium at the junction of the superior vena cava with the posterior atrial wall is 5.5±1.3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm. The multiple raised parallel ridges of the pectinate muscles extend anterolaterally from the crista terminalis, reaching into the right auricle where they form several trabeculations. The largest and most prominent pectinate muscle, the taenia sagittalis (second crest or septum spurium), forms the bridge of the sulcus terminalis internally. The septal wall is dominated by the fossa ovalis, an oval depression superior and normally to the left of the orifice of the inferior vena cava. Its floor is the primary atrial septum (septum primum). The limbus (rim) of the fossa ovalis is prominent. Often said to represent the edge of the septum secundum, in reality the muscular borders of the fossa are no more than infoldings of the atrial walls, incorporating extracardiac adipose tissue. The limbus is most distinct anterosuperior to the fossa, and is usually deficient inferiorly. Some hearts display an excessive amount of extracardiac adipose tissue within the fold, markedly elevating the superior limbus of the fossa and forming the intervenous tubercle of Lower (interatrial fold of the inferior vena cava). A small slit-shaped passageway is sometimes found at the superior margin of the fossa ovalis. It ascends beneath the limbus, between it and the valve of the foramen ovale, to communicate with the left atrium, and represents failure of obliteration of the fetal foramen ovale, which remains patent or probe-patent in up to one-third of all normal hearts. Anteroinferiorly in the right atrium the large, oval vestibule leads to the right atrioventricular (tricuspid) orifice. A triangular zone, the triangle of Koch (triangle of the atrioventricular node), is present between the attachment of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, the anteromedial margin of the opening of the coronary sinus (and its valve), and the palpable round, collagenous subendocardial tendon of Todaro (see <a href="#f0170">Figs 57.13</a>–<a href="#f0025">57.14</a>). Koch’s triangle is a landmark of surgical importance since it contains the atrioventricular node and its atrial connections. Anterosuperior to the insertion of the tendon of Todaro, the septal wall is formed by the atrioventricular part of the membranous septum, which intervenes between the vestibule of the right atrium and the subaortic outlet of the left ventricle (<a href="#f0185"><span class="bold">Fig. 57.17</span></a>). The bulging atrial wall anterosuperior to the membranous septum, the aortic mound (torus aorticus), marks the location of the non-adjacent aortic sinus with its enclosed aortic valvular leaflet.</div><div class="text" id="p0340"><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0185"><!--<img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000574/main.assets/f57-07-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/>--><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0185"/><a id="fspara0195"/><!--<span class="fignum">Fig. 57.17</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, A dissection opening the ventricles, viewed from a superolateral perspective.<a id="fspara0200"/>(B, <span class="italic">continued online</span>) <br/><span class="figcredit">With permission from Waschke J, Paulsen F (eds) Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy, 15th ed.

The crest is made up predominantly by the inner heart curvature, bounded on the epicardial aspect by the rightward margin of the transverse pericardial sinus. The crest is a thick, muscular, highly arched structure, extending obliquely anteriorly and to the right from a septal limb high on the interventricular septal wall to a mural or parietal limb on the anterolateral right ventricular wall. The posterolateral aspect of the crest provides the principal attachment for the anterosuperior leaflet of the tricuspid valve. The septal limb of the crest is embraced by the septal limbs of the septomarginal trabeculation (moderator band). The inlet and outlet parts of the ventricle extend apically into and from the prominent coarsely trabeculated part of the ventricle. The inlet part itself is also trabeculated, whereas the outlet part has predominantly smooth walls, albeit with septoparietal trabeculations anteriorly. The trabeculated appearance is produced by a myriad of endocardial lined, irregular muscular ridges and protrusions collectively known as trabeculae carneae. These protrusions and intervening grooves impart great variation in ventricular wall thickness; the protrusions vary in extent from slight ridges to trabeculations, fixed at both ends but otherwise free. Other conspicuous protrusions are the papillary muscles, which are inserted at one end on to the ventricular wall and are continuous at the other end with collagenous cords, the chordae tendineae (tendinous cords), inserted on the free edge of the tricuspid valvular leaflets. One protrusion in the right ventricle, the septomarginal trabecula, is particularly prominent, originating as one or more limbs from the upper two-thirds of the interventricular septum, from the supraventricular crest to the ventricular apex. Towards the ventricular apex, it supports the anterior papillary muscle of the tricuspid valve and, from this point, crosses to the parietal (anterior) wall of the ventricle. The septomarginal trabecula is often termed the moderator band, a name reflecting an earlier idea that it prevented overdistension of the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1076" id="pagebreak_1076"/><a id="pg1076"/>ventricle. The role of the septomarginal trabecula as part of the conduction system of the heart involves carrying the right branch of the atrioventricular bundle, as conduction cardiomyocytes move towards the apex of the ventricle before entering the anterior papillary muscle. The septomarginal trabecula may be any combination of short or long and thick or thin: it is occasionally absent. A further series of prominent trabeculations, the septoparietal trabeculations, extend from the anterior surface of the septomarginal trabecula and run on to the parietal ventricular wall. The smooth-walled outflow tract (conus arteriosus or infundibulum), ascends to the left, superior to the septoparietal trabeculations and inferior to the arch of the supraventricular crest to the pulmonary orifice (<a href="#bib45" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_45">Spicer and Anderson 2013</a>).</div><section><a id="sf0030"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0030"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000574/main.assets/f57-08-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0030"/><a id="fspara0030"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 57.18</span> Internal features of the right atrium and ventricle shown (<span class="bold">A</span>) in a cadaveric heart and (<span class="bold">B</span>) an illustration showing the atrioventricular node, atrioventricular bundle and right bundle, viewed via a ‘window dissection’ (prepared by removing the anterosuperior wall of the right atrium and ventricle).

Harmonious interplay of these components, together with the myocardial mass, depends on the conduction tissues and mechanical cohesion provided by the cardiac skeleton.

There is a clear line of transition from the atrial wall or interatrial septum to the lines of attachment of the valvular leaflets. Its margins are not precisely in a single plane. It is almost vertical but at 45° to the sagittal plane and slightly inclined to the vertical, such that it faces (on its ventricular aspect) anterolaterally to the left and somewhat inferiorly (<a href="#f0035"><span class="bold">Fig. 57.19</span></a>). Roughly triangular, its margins are described as anterosuperior, inferior and septal, corresponding to the lines of attachment of the valvular leaflets. The connective tissues around the orifice of the atrioventricular valves separate the atrial and ventricular myocardial masses completely, except at the point of penetration of the atrioventricular bundle; they vary in density and disposition around the circumference of the valvular orifice. Extending from the right fibrous trigone of the central fibrous body is a pair of fila coronaria (curved, tapered, prong-like subendocardial tendons), which partly encircle the circumference of the right atrioventricular orifice (see <a href="#f0045">Fig. 57.22</a>). The latter is completed by more tenuous, deformable fibroblastic sulcal areolar tissue. Although the extent of cardiac fibrous tissue varies with sex and age, the tissue within the atrioventricular junction around the tricuspid orifice is always less robust than similar elements found at the attachments of the mitral valve. The topographical attachment of the free valvular leaflets in the tricuspid valve does not wholly correspond to the internal level of attachment of the fibrous core of the valvular leaflets to the junctional atrioventricular connective tissue. The line of attachment of the leaflets is best seen when the heart is examined grossly, and is more readily discerned clinically.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0035"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000574/main.assets/f57-09-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0035"/><a id="fspara0035"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 57.19</span> The relationship between the anterior thoracic wall and valves of the heart.

The leaflets are located anterosuperiorly, septally and inferiorly, corresponding to the respectively named marginal sectors of the atrioventricular orifice (see <a href="#f0195">Fig. 57.21A</a>). The inferior leaflet is often described as being posterior, but when assessed in the attitudinally correct anatomical position, the leaflet is positioned inferiorly (<a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_1">Anderson and Loukas 2009</a>). Each leaflet is a reduplication of endocardium enclosing a collagenous core, continuous on its free margin and ventricular aspect with diverging fascicles of chordae tendineae, and confluent with the anular connective tissue at the inserted margin.</div><div class="text" id="p0380">In passing from the free margin to the inserted margin, all leaflets of the atrioventricular valves display rough, clear and basal zones. The rough zone is relatively thick, opaque and uneven on its ventricular aspect where most chordae tendineae are attached; its atrial aspect contacts the comparable surface of the adjacent leaflets during full valve closure. The clear zone is smooth and translucent, receives few chordae tendineae and has a thinner, fibrous core. The basal zone, extending 2–3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm from the circumferential attachment (inserted margin) of the leaflets, is thicker (because of increased connective tissue), vascularized and innervated, and contains the insertions of the atrial myocardium. The anterosuperior leaflet is the largest part of the tricuspid valve and has a semicircular shape. It is attached mainly to the atrioventricular junction on the posterolateral aspect of the supraventricular crest, extending along its septal limb to the membranous septum ending at the anteroseptal commissure. One or more notches often indent its free margin. The attachment of the septal leaflet passes from the inferoseptal commissure on the inferior ventricular wall across the muscular septum, then angling across the membranous septum to the anteroseptal commissure. The septal leaflet defines one of the borders of the triangle of Koch, thereby aiding location of the atrioventricular node at the apex of this triangle, and ensuring avoidance during tricuspid valve surgery (see <a href="#f0170">Figs 57.13</a>–<a href="#f0025">57.14</a>, <a href="#f0045">57.22</a>). The inferior leaflet is wholly mural in attachment and guards the inferior surface of the atrioventricular junction, its limits being the inferoseptal and anteroinferior commissures. The zone of apposition between the septal and the anterosuperior leaflets is supported by the septal papillary muscle of the conus arteriosus.</div><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1077" id="pagebreak_1077"/></div></section><section><a id="s0235"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0205">Opening of the tricuspid valve</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0385">Despite its name, the tricuspid valve acts more like a bicuspid valve because its smallest septal leaflet is fixed between the atrial and ventricular septa. The remainder of the tricuspid anulus is muscular. The anulus of the tricuspid valve is less fibrous than the anulus of the mitral valve, which presumably accounts for the low occurrence of degenerative calcifications seen on the tricuspid valve (<a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_44">Saremi et al 2017</a>). During diastole, the anulus dilates with right ventricular relaxation and the large anterosuperior and inferior leaflets move away from the plane of the anulus into the right ventricle. During systole, the anulus constricts as the right ventricle contracts and the two major leaflets move like sails about a relatively immobile septal leaflet and the septum itself (<a href="#f0040"><span class="bold">Fig. 57.20</span></a>).<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1078" id="pagebreak_1078"/><a id="pg1078"/></div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0040"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000574/main.assets/f57-10-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0040"/><a id="fspara0040"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 57.20</span> A summary of some of the principal events that occur in the cardiac cycle.

In about one-third of hearts, false chordae connect the papillary muscles to each other or to the ventricular wall or septum, or pass directly between points on the wall or septum, or both. Their numbers and dimensions in the right ventricle vary: approximately 40% of these false cords contain conduction cardiomyocytes.</div><div class="text" id="p0395">The true chordae usually arise from small projections on the tips or margins of the apical third of papillary muscles, but may sometimes arise from the papillary muscle bases or directly from the ventricular walls and septum. They are attached to various parts of the ventricular aspects or the free margins of the valvular leaflets. True chordae are classified into first-, second- and third-order types, according to the distance of the attachment from the margins of the leaflets, but this classification has little functional or morphological merit. Fan-shaped chordae have a short stem from which branches radiate to attach to the free margins or ventricular aspect of the zones of apposition between leaflets and to the ends of adjacent leaflets. Rough-zone chordae arise from a single stem that usually splits into three parts that attach to the free margin, the ventricular aspect of the rough zone and to some intermediate points on the leaflet, respectively. Free-edge chordae are single, thread-like and often long, passing from either the apex or the base of a papillary muscle into a marginal attachment, usually near the midpoint of a leaflet or to one of the scallops on its free edge. Deep chordae pass beyond the free margins and, branching to various extents, reach the more peripheral rough zone or even the clear zone. Basal chordae are round or ribbon-like, long and slender, or short and muscular; they arise from the smooth or trabeculated ventricular wall and are attached to the inserted margin (basal part) of a leaflet.</div></section><section><a id="s0245"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0215">Papillary muscles</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0400">The two major papillary muscles in the right ventricle are located in anterior and inferior positions. A third, smaller septal muscle lies medially, together with several smaller, variable muscles attached to the interventricular septum. The anterior papillary muscle is the largest, its base arising from the right anterolateral ventricular wall inferior to the anteroinferior commissure between the anterosuperior and inferior valvular leaflets, also blending with the right side of the septomarginal trabecula. The inferior papillary muscle, often bifid or trifid, arises from the myocardium inferior to the inferoseptal valvular commissure. The septal papillary muscle of the conus (muscle of Lancisi) is almost always present and is the most superior and largest of the small septal papillary muscles. It arises from the posterior septal limb of the septomarginal trabeculation and locates the right bundle branch within the right ventricle. All the major papillary muscles supply chordae to adjacent parts of the valvular leaflets they support (see <a href="#f0185">Figs 57.17</a>–<a href="#f0030">57.18</a>). A feature of the right ventricle is that the septal leaflet is tethered by individual chordae tendineae directly to the interventricular septum; such septal insertions are never seen in the left ventricle. When closed, the three leaflets fit snugly together, the pattern of the zones of apposition confirming the trifoliate arrangement of the tricuspid valve.</div></section><section><a id="s0250"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0220">Pulmonary valve</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0405">The pulmonary valve, guarding the outflow from the right ventricle, sits at the top of the conus arteriosus (infundibulum) and is situated at some distance from the other three cardiac valves (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 57.19</a>; <a href="#f0195"><span class="bold">Figs 57.21</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0045"><span class="bold">57.22</span></a>).

The convention of referring to the leaflets as anterior, posterior and septal is based on their fetal position: in the adult, the leaflets become anterior, right and left, respectively. Each leaflet is an endocardial fold with a variably developed intervening fibrous core that traverses both the free edge and the semilunar-shaped inserted margin. The latter is particularly thickened at its deepest central part (the nadir) of the base (inserted margin) of each leaflet, and therefore never forms a simple complete fibrous ring. The free margin of each leaflet contains a central localized collagenous thickening, the nodule of the semilunar leaflet (nodule of Arantius).

Its cavity and walls are formed largely by the proximal parts of the primordial pulmonary veins that are incorporated into the atrial wall during development. The atrial auricle is a remnant of the initial atrial component of the primary heart tube (<a href="../B9780702077050000136/B9780702077050000136.xhtml">Ch. 13</a>). The left atrium is roughly cuboidal, extending posterior to the right atrium and separated from it by the obliquely positioned interatrial septum. The right atrium is therefore anterolateral to the right part of the left atrium. The left part is covered anteriorly by the intraepicardial part of the pulmonary trunk and ascending aorta, and part of the intervening transverse pericardial sinus. Anteroinferiorly, and to the left, it adjoins the base of the left ventricle at the orifice of the mitral (left atrioventricular) valve. Its approximately quadrangular posterior wall forms most of the anatomical base of the heart, receives the terminations of (usually) two pulmonary veins from both the left and right lungs, and forms the anterior wall of the oblique pericardial sinus (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 57.1</a>).

After closure of the mitral valvular leaflets and throughout the ejection phase of systole, blood is expelled from the cardiac apex through the aortic orifice. In contrast to the orifices within the right ventricle, those of the left ventricle are in close contact: fibrous continuity between leaflets of the aortic and mitral valves forms the subaortic curtain (see <a href="#f0045">Fig. 57.22</a>). The inlet and outlet turn sharply round this fibrous curtain (<a href="#f0065"><span class="bold">Fig. 57.29</span></a>). The anteromedial wall is the muscular interventricular septum: its convexity completes the circular cross-section of the left ventricle (see <a href="#f0215">Fig. 57.27</a>). Towards the aortic orifice, the septum becomes the thin and collagenous membranous part of the interventricular septum, an oval or round area below and confluent with the right fibrous trigone (triangle) that separates the right and the non-adjacent leaflets of the aortic valve (see <a href="#f0045">Figs 57.22</a>, <a href="#f0070">57.30</a>).

Echocardiography accurately assesses the degree of thickening and its effect on systolic function, such as dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction, systolic anterior motion of the aortic leaflet of the mitral and mid-systolic closure of the aortic valve. There may also be a degree of diastolic dysfunction. Serial short-axis gradient echo MRI allows accurate measurement of wall thickness and is particularly useful in assessing apically confined hypertrophy. There are a number of histological changes, including cardiomyocytic disarray with replacement fibrosis and collagenous component expansion. Treatment is usually medical, except for refractory cases and when the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction has a gradient of greater than 50<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mmHg.

In contrast, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy reveals asymmetric patterns of left ventricular hypertrophy, often with sharp segmental transitions, left atrial enlargement and unusual electrocardiographic patterns. There is an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of abnormalities in genes coding for myocardial proteins associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Individuals with mutations of the β-MHC (major histocompatibility complex) gene usually develop the classic form of hypertrophy, whereas those with mutations of the cardiac troponin T gene generally have only mild or clinically undetectable hypertrophy. Rare forms of hypertrophy include localized left ventricular apical hypertrophy as a result of mutations of the cardiac troponin I gene, and isolated mid-cavity hypertrophy caused by mutations of cardiac actin and MLC (myosin light chain) genes.</div></section><section><a id="s0290"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0260">Mitral (left atrioventricular) valve</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0500">The general description of the component parts of the tricuspid valve (see <a href="#pg1076">p. 1076</a>) also applies to the mitral valve; it has an orifice with a supporting anulus, valvular leaflets and varying arrangements of chordae tendineae and papillary muscles.</div></section><section><a id="s0295"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0265">Mitral valvular orifice</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0505">The mitral orifice, smaller than the tricuspid orifice, is a well-defined transitional zone between the left atrial wall and the inserted margin of the mitral valvular leaflet bases. It measures, on average, 9.0<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm in circumference in males and 7.2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm in females. The approximately oval orifice is almost vertical and at 45° to the sagittal plane in diastole, but with a slight anterior tilt. Its ventricular aspect faces anterolaterally to the left and a little inferiorly towards the left ventricular apex (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 57.19</a>). It is almost co-planar with the tricuspid orifice but posterosuperior to it, whereas it is posteroinferior and slightly to the left of the aortic orifice. The mitral, tricuspid and aortic orifices are intimately connected at the site of the central fibrous body (see <a href="#f0045">Fig. 57.22</a>). When the mitral valve leaflets close, they form a single zone of coaptation that should be termed the commissure: clinicians usually recognized the two ends of the zone as commissures. The anulus of the valve is not a simple fibrous ring but is made up of fibrocollagenous elements of varying consistency, from which the fibrous core of each leaflet take origin; the variable consistency is essential to allow the major changes in anular shape and dimensions during the cardiac cycle that are needed for optimal valvular efficiency. The area of the anulus increases linearly with body surface area in children and young adults (<a href="#bib39" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_39">Poutanen et al 2006</a>). The anulus is strongest at the internal aspects of the left and right fibrous trigones. Extending from these structures, the anterior and posterior fila coronaria (curved, tapered, fibrous, prong-like subendocardial tendons) partly encircle the orifice at the atrioventricular junction (see <a href="#f0045">Fig. 57.22</a>). Between the tips of the fila coronaria, the atrial and ventricular myocardial masses are separated by a more irregular sheet of deformable fibroelastic connective tissue. Spanning anteriorly between the fibrous trigones, the fibrous core of the central part of the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve is a continuation of the fibrous subaortic curtain that descends from the adjacent halves of the left and non-adjacent (non-coronary) valve leaflets (see <a href="#f0045">Fig. 57.22</a>, <a href="#f0065">57.29</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0300"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0270">Mitral valvular leaflets</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0510">The mitral valvular leaflets have long been described as paired structures. The name ‘bicuspid valve’ is explicit but erroneous as a descriptor because the leaflets are not cuspid, or ‘peaked’, in form. <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1082" id="pagebreak_1082"/>A small accessory (commissural) leaflet is almost always found between the two major leaflets (aortic and mural) and so the mitral valve is better described as a continuous veil that is attached around the entire circumference of the mitral orifice. The free edge of the mural and aortic leaflets normally bear several indentations that create a scalloped edge. Two indentations are sufficiently deep and regular to be defined as the ends of the solitary and oblique zone of apposition or the commissures of the valve. These inferoseptal (anteromedial) and superoposterior (posterolateral) extremities of the solitary zone of apposition may be regarded as two independent commissures.</div><div class="text" id="p0515">The original designations of anterior and posterior for the valve leaflets are somewhat misleading because of the obliquity of the valve, and the terms aortic and mural leaflet, respectively, are now preferred. When the valve is laid open, the aortic leaflet (anterior, septal, ‘greater’ or anteromedial) is seen to guard one-third of the circumference of the orifice and to be semicircular or triangular, with few or no free marginal indentations or scallops. Its fibrous core (lamina fibrosa) is continuous on the outflow aspect, beyond the margins of the fibrous subaortic curtain, with the right and left fibrous trigones (see <a href="#f0185">Figs 57.17</a>, <a href="#f0195">57.21</a>, <a href="#f0050">57.23C</a>). Between the trigones, it is continuous with the fibrous subaortic curtain itself and, beyond the trigones, with the roots of the filia coronaria (see <a href="#f0045">Fig. 57.22</a>). The leaflet has a deep crescentic rough zone that receives various chordae tendineae. The ridge limiting the outer margin of the rough zone indicates the maximal extent of surface contact with the mural leaflet in full closure. A clear zone is seen between the rough zone and the valvular anulus; it is devoid of attachments of chordae, although its fibrous core carries extensions from chordae attached in the rough zone. The aortic leaflet has no basal zone and continues into the subaortic curtain. Hinging on its anular attachment, and continuous with the subaortic curtain, it is critically placed between the inlet and the outlet of the ventricle. During passive ventricular filling and atrial systole, its smooth atrial surface is important in directing a smooth flow of blood towards the body and apex of the ventricle. After the onset of ventricular systole and closure of the mitral valve, the ventricular aspect of its clear zone merges into the smooth surface of the subaortic curtain, which, with the remaining fibrous walls of the subvalvular aortic vestibule, forms the smooth boundaries of the outlet part of the ventricle.</div><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1083" id="pagebreak_1083"/></div></section><div class="text" id="p0520">The mural leaflet (posterior, ventricular, ‘smaller’ or posterolateral) usually has two or more minor indentations on its free margin that form scallops. Lack of definition of the major intervalvular commissures has led to disagreement and confusion concerning the territorial extent of this leaflet and the possible existence of accessory scallops. Examination of the valve in the closed position reveals that the mural leaflet may conveniently be regarded as comprising all the valvular tissue posterior to the inferoseptal (anterolateral) and superomedial (posteromedial) ends of the major zone of apposition with the aortic leaflet. Thus defined, it has a wider attachment to the anulus than does the aortic leaflet and guards two-thirds of the circumferential attachments. In most cases indentations usually divide the mural leaflet into <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1084" id="pagebreak_1084"/><a id="pg1084"/>a relatively large middle scallop and smaller lateral and septal commissural scallops. Each scallop has a crescentic opaque rough zone, receiving on its ventricular aspect the attachments of the chordae that define the area of valvular apposition in full closure.

The ratio of rough to clear zone in the aortic leaflet is 0.6 and in the middle scallop of the mural leaflet is 1.4. Much more of the mural leaflet is in apposition with the aortic leaflet during closure of the mitral valve.</div></section><section><a id="s0305"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0275">Opening of the mitral valve</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0525">At the onset of diastole, opening is passive but rapid, the valvular leaflets parting and projecting into the ventricle as left atrial pressure exceeds left ventricular diastolic pressure (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 57.20</a>). Passive ventricular filling proceeds as atrial blood pours to the apex, directed by the hanging aortic valvular leaflet. The leaflets begin to float passively together, hingeing on their anular attachments and partially occluding the ventricular inlet. Atrial systole now occurs, forcing blood apically and causing re-opening of the leaflets. As maximal filling is achieved, the leaflets again float rapidly together. Closure is followed by ventricular systole, which starts in the papillary muscles and continues rapidly as a general contraction of the walls and septum.</div><div class="text" id="p0530">Coordinated contraction of the papillary muscles increases the tension in the chordae and promotes joining of the corresponding points on opposing leaflets, preventing their eversion. With general mural and septal excitation and contraction, left ventricular pressure increases rapidly. The leaflets ‘balloon’ towards the atrial cavity, and the atrial aspects of the rough zones come into maximal contact. Precise papillary contraction, and increasing tension in the chordae tendinae, continue to prevent valvular eversion and maintain valvular competence. The orifices and the leaflets of both the left and right atrioventricular valves undergo considerable changes in position, form and area during a cardiac cycle. Both valves move anteriorly and to the left during systole, and reverse their motion in diastole. The mitral valve reduces the area of its orifice (anulus) by as much as 40% during systole; its shape changes from circular to crescentic at the height of systole, the anular attachment of its aortic leaflet being the concavity of the crescent. The attachment of its mural leaflet, although remaining convex, contracts towards the anterior cardiac surface. The smooth left ventricular outflow tract (aortic vestibule) terminates at the leaflets of the aortic valve. Although stronger in construction, the aortic valve resembles the pulmonary valve (see <a href="#f0195">Figs 57.21</a>, <a href="#f0050">57.23</a>, <a href="#f0065">57.29</a>) in possessing three semilunar leaflets, supported within the three aortic sinuses (of Valsalva). Although the aortic valve, like the pulmonary valve, is often described as possessing an anulus in continuity with the fibrous skeleton, there is no complete collagenous ring that supports the attachments of the leaflets. As with the pulmonary valve, the anatomy of the aortic valve is dominated by the fibrous semilunar leaflet attachment (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 57.23C</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0310"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0280">Mitral valvular chordae tendineae (tendinous cords)</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0535">The chordae tendineae of the mitral valve resemble those supporting the tricuspid valve (<a href="#f0070"><span class="bold">Fig. 57.30</span></a>; see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 57.29</a>). False chordae are also irregularly distributed as in the right ventricle. They are single or multiple, thin, fibrous or fibromuscular structures that traverse the cavity of the left ventricle and have no connection with the valvular leaflets. They occur commonly in the left ventricle and often cross the subaortic outflow. Histologically, false chordae sometimes contain extensions from the ventricular conducting tissues; these left ventricular bands are often identified on echocardiography. It has been suggested that false chordae produce premature ventricular contractions and may be the cause of functional heart murmurs or innocent murmurs in children and young adults.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0070"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000574/main.assets/f57-18-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0070"/><a id="fspara0070"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 57.30</span> Internal features of the left ventricle, aortic sinus and ascending aorta of a cadaveric heart.

Most true chordae divide into branches from a single stem soon after their origin from the apical third of a papillary muscle, or proceed as single chordae that each divide into several branches near their attachment. Basal chordae, in contrast, are solitary structures passing from the ventricular wall to the mural leaflet and are supported by their own miniature papillary muscles. There is such marked variation between the arrangement of the chordae (<a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_10">Gunnal et al 2015</a>) that any detailed classification loses much of its clinical significance. Suffice it to say that, in the majority of hearts, the chordae support the free margins of the valvular leaflets, together with varying degrees of their ventricular aspects and bases, and there is some evidence to suggest that those leaflets with unsupported free edges become prone to prolapse in later life.</div></section><section><a id="s0315"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0285">Papillary muscles</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0545">The two papillary muscles supporting the leaflets of the mitral valve vary in length and width, and may be bifid.

Chordae tendineae arise mostly from the tip and apical third of each muscle but sometimes take origin near their base. The chordae from each papillary muscle diverge and are attached to corresponding areas of closure (apposition) on both valvular leaflets.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0320"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0290">Aortic root</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0550">The aortic root, the anatomical bridge between the left ventricle and ascending aorta, consists of the aortic valvular leaflets supported by the aortic sinuses (of Valsalva), and the inter-leaflet triangles interposed between their basal attachments (inserted margin). As such, it is relatively long, but because of the semilunar attachment of the leaflets, it has no discrete proximal border. It is limited distally by the sinutubular junction, which is the only circular or anular structure located within the aortic root (see <a href="#f0050">Figs 57.23</a>, <a href="#f0070">57.30</a>). The essential feature is the semilunar attachments of the valve leaflets; the lines of their point of hingeing cross the anatomical ventriculoarterial junction, marking a transition from the myocardium of the left ventricle to the fibroelastic tissue of the aortic sinuses (<a href="#f0225"><span class="bold">Fig. 57.31</span></a>). The muscular portion of the aortic root is roughly half of its circumference. Descriptions of the aortic root over the years have included erroneous accounts of a valve anulus. Although echocardiographers used to describe this proximal <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1085" id="pagebreak_1085"/>border in terms of an anulus, examination of cross-sections of the left ventricular outflow tract has never found any circular anatomical boundary or a distinct boundary of any kind (<a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_26">Loukas et al 2014a</a>). There are at least two rings within the aortic root, attached in semilunar fashion from the sinutubular junction to a basal ventricular attachment, and neither serves to support the aortic valvular leaflets. Two of the leaflets are partially supported by muscle, and the third has an exclusively fibrous attachment. The root acts as a bridging structure not only anatomically, separating the myocardial and arterial parts of the left ventricular pathway, but also functionally because its proximal and distal parts can withstand considerable changes in ventricular and arterial pressures.</div><div id="p0555"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0225"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000574/main.assets/on57-17-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0225"/><a id="fspara0245"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 57.31</span> A histological section through an aortic sinus demonstrating ventricular muscle supporting the transition from the fibroelastic wall of the sinus to the tissues of the valvular leaflet.

Posterior, right and left refer to their embryonic positions before full cardiac rotation has occurred (<a href="../B9780702077050000136/B9780702077050000136.xhtml">Ch. 13</a>). Names based on their approximate positions in maturity are anterior, left posterior and right posterior, respectively. Widespread clinical terminology, which links the leaflets and sinuses to the origins of the coronary arteries, has replaced anterior, left and right posterior leaflets with right coronary, left coronary and non-adjacent (non-coronary) leaflets, respectively. The non-coronary leaflet is more accurately termed the non-adjacent leaflet, since the associated aortic sinus may give rise (rarely) to a coronary artery that is consistently situated adjacent to the root of the pulmonary trunk. These clinical terms are preferable because they are simple and unambiguous.</div><div class="text" id="p0565">The aortic valve leaflets are attached in part to the aortic wall and in part to adjacent supporting ventricular structures. The arrangement is more complicated than in the pulmonary valve because parts of the leaflets also take origin from the fibrous subaortic curtain, and are continuous with the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 57.29</a>). This fibrous area of continuity is thickened at its two ends to form the right and left fibrous trigones (see <a href="#f0195">Figs 57.21</a>, <a href="#f0045">57.22</a>). The semilunar attachments of the aortic valve incorporate segments of ventricular tissue within the bases of two of the aortic sinuses that give rise to the coronary arteries. The aortic sinuses are named according to the aortic valvular leaflet with which they are associated (see <a href="#f0050">Figs 57.23C</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000574/B9780702077050000574.xhtml#f0065">57.29</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0570">The semilunar attachments incorporate three triangular areas of aortic wall within the apex of the left ventricular outflow tract. They are interposed between the aortic sinuses and separate the cavity of the left ventricle from the pericardial cavity. Removal of the trigones in an otherwise intact heart is instructive in demonstrating the relationships of the aortic valve, which, justifiably, may be considered as the keystone of the heart. The first triangle, between the non-adjacent and left coronary leaflets, has a base continuous inferiorly with the fibrous subaortic curtain (see <a href="#f0045">Figs 57.22</a>, <a href="#f0070">57.30</a>). The second triangle, between the right coronary and non-adjacent leaflets, has the membranous parts of the interventricular septum as its base. It faces the right ventricle, whereas its apex is directed towards the transverse pericardial sinus posterior to the origin of the right coronary artery. The third triangle, between the left and right coronary leaflets, has its base on the muscular interventricular septum and its apex directed to the plane of the space between the aortic wall and the free-standing sleeve of right ventricular infundibular musculature that supports the leaflets of the pulmonary valve. Although the basal attachments (inserted margins) of each aortic valvular leaflet are thickened and collagenous at their ventricular origins, the leaflets lack a continuous circular collagenous support and valvular function depends primarily upon the semilunar attachments of the leaflets.</div><div class="text" id="p0575">The leaflets are endocardial folds with a central fibrous core covered by subendothelial fibroelastic tissue on its aortic and ventricular aspects. With the valve half open, each is equivalent to just greater than one-quarter of a sphere; an approximate hemisphere is completed when this is viewed in conjunction with the corresponding aortic sinus. Each leaflet has a thick basal border that is deeply concave on its aortic aspect, and a horizontal free margin that is only slightly thickened, except at its midpoint, where an aggregation of fibroelastic tissue on the ventricular aspect forms the nodule of the semilunar leaflet (Arantius). The nodule extends bilaterally along the central part of the inferior border of the lunule. The crescent-shaped zone of apposition (lunule), on the ventricular surface of the leaflet, extends along its free edge and up to one-third of its depth (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 57.29</a>). Parts of the lunule are relatively thin and may be fenestrated, particularly in older adults; fenestrations are inconsequential if located above the line of valve closure. The aortic surface of each leaflet is rougher than its ventricular aspect.</div></section><section><a id="s0335"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0300">Aortic sinuses (of Valsalva)</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0580">The three aortic sinuses (right, left and non-adjacent) are more prominent than those in the pulmonary trunk. The upper limit of each sinus reaches considerably beyond the level of the free border of each aortic valvular leaflet and forms a well-defined circumferential sinutubular ridge on the aortic inner surface, just above the aortic valvular leaflets (see <a href="#f0050">Figs 57.23C</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000574/B9780702077050000574.xhtml#f0065">57.29</a>). Coronary arteries usually open near this ridge within the upper part of the sinus, but may be markedly variable in their origin. The walls of the sinuses are largely collagenous near the attachment of the leaflets but the amount of lamellated elastic tissue increases with distance from the region of attachment. At the midlevel of each sinus, its wall is about half the thickness of the supravalvular aortic wall and less than one-quarter of the thickness of the sinutubular ridge. At this level, the mean luminal diameter at the commencement of the aortic root is much larger than that of the ascending aorta; these details are functionally significant in the mechanism of aortic valvular motion. For example, a linear relationship between the diameter of the aortic sinus and the square root of body surface area has been described in children (<a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Kaiser et al 2008</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0340"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0305">Opening of the aortic valve</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0585">During diastole, the closed aortic valve supports an aortic column of blood at high but slowly diminishing pressure (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 57.20</a>). Each sinus and its valvular leaflet form a hemispherical chamber. The three nodules of the semilunar leaflets are apposed and the free margins and lunular parts of the adjacent leaflets are tightly apposed on their ventricular aspects. From the aortic aspect, the closed valve is triradiate, with three pairs of closely compressed lunules radiating from the nodules to their peripheral commissural attachments at the sinutubular junction (see <a href="#f0195">Figs 57.21</a>, <a href="#f0065">57.29</a>). As ventricular systolic pressure increases, it exceeds aortic pressure and the valve is opened passively.</div><div class="text" id="p0590">The fibrous wall of the sinuses nearest the aortic vestibule is almost inextensible but, more superiorly, the wall is fibroelastic. Under left ventricular ejection pressure, the radius of this region increases by about 16% in systole, as the commissures move apart to form a fully open triangular orifice. The free margins of the leaflets then become almost straight lines between their peripheral attachments. However, they do not flatten against the sinus walls, even at maximal systolic pressure, which is probably an important factor in their subsequent closure. During ejection, most blood enters the ascending aorta but some enters the sinuses, forming vortices that help to maintain the triangular mid-position of the leaflet during ventricular systole and also probably initiate their approximation at the end of systole. Tight and full closure occurs with the rapid decrease in ventricular pressure in diastole. Commissures narrow, nodules appose and the valve reassumes its triradiate form. Experiments indicate that 4% of ejected blood regurgitates through a valve with normal aortic sinuses, whereas 23% regurgitates through a valve without them. The normal structure of the aortic sinuses also promotes non-turbulent flow into the coronary arteries.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0345"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0310">Echocardiography</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0600">Echocardiography allows a detailed assessment of the functional anatomy of the heart. The gross anatomy of the heart can be evaluated by two-dimensional echocardiography in the parasternal, apical, suprasternal and subcostal positions (<a href="#f0230"><span class="bold">Fig. 57.32</span></a>). The standardized planes used are long-axis, short-axis and four-chamber. The long-axis view is obtained by placing the ultrasound transducer in the left apicosternal position and provides detailed images of the left ventricle, ascending aorta, left atrium, and mitral and aortic valves (<a href="#f0230">Fig. 57.32C</a>). Angling the beam towards the right also allows assessment of the right atrium, right ventricle and tricuspid valves. Rotating the transducer by 90° in the clockwise direction produces the short-axis view, which allows assessment of the left ventricle, papillary muscles, chordae tendineae and mitral valve leaflets (<a href="#f0230">Fig. 57.32B</a>).

The amount of connective tissue varies greatly in arrangement and form in different locations. Most of the fibrous tissue network of the heart is condensed at the atrioventricular junctions. The network assists in anchoring the valve leaflets to the ventricular masses and is crucial for the propagation of electrical conduction because it insulates the atrial chambers from the ventricular mass, other than at the site of the atrioventricular node. Over much of the heart, a fine layer of areolar tissue found beneath the mesothelium of the visceral part of the serous pericardium (epicardium) accumulates subepicardial fat, concentrated along the inferior border (acute margin), the atrioventricular and interventricular sulci, and their side channels. The coronary vessels and their main branches are embedded in this fat; the amount of fat increases with age. The endocardium also lies on a fine areolar tissue rich in elastic fibres. Fibrocellular components of these subepicardial and subendocardial <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1086" id="pagebreak_1086"/>layers blend on their mural aspects with the endomysial and perimysial connective tissue on the myocardium. Each cardiac myocyte is invested by a delicate endomysium composed of fine reticular, collagen and elastin fibres embedded in ground substance. This matrix is lacking only at desmosomal and gap junctional contacts of intercalated discs. Similar arrangements apply to ventricular conduction myocytes and their extensive working myocardial contacts. The connective tissue matrix itself is interconnected laterally to form bundles, strands or sheets of macroscopic proportions showing a complex geometric pattern. Surrounding and attaching to larger myocardial bundles are stronger perimysial condensations. The overall pattern is described in terms of struts and weaves. Despite its importance, the myocardial matrix cannot be grossly dissected.</div><div class="text" id="p0615">Running at the ventricular base is a complex framework of dense collagen with membranous, tendinous and fibroareolar extensions, intimately related to atrioventricular valves and the aortic orifice. The structure as a whole is sufficiently distinct to be termed the fibrous skeleton of the heart. Although it is often stated that all four valves are contained within this skeleton, this is not the case. The leaflets of the pulmonary valve are supported on a free-standing sleeve of right ventricular infundibulum (conus arteriosus) that can easily be removed from the heart without disturbing either the fibrous skeleton or the left ventricle. Moreover, the fibrous skeleton of the heart does not incorporate the entirety of the atrioventricular and arterial anuli. Much of the insulation between the atrial and ventricular chambers is provided by the fibroadipose tissues within the atrioventricular sulci. There is some collagenous tissue in the mitral valvular anulus, but it is not always continuous with the fibrous structure. The tricuspid valvular anulus is almost exclusively composed of fibroadipose tissue. The only true fibrous part of the tricuspid anulus is where the valvular leaflets are attached to the central fibrous body (<a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Saremi et al 2017</a>). Another point of confusion is the idea that the fibrous skeleton provides the support for the cardiac valves. In reality, it is the overall structure of the atrioventricular junctions that supports the mitral and tricuspid valves, whereas the arterial valves are hinged within the valvular sinuses. The fibrous skeleton is strongest at the central fibrous body, which is the junction of the aortic, mitral and tricuspid valves (see <a href="#f0195">Figs 57.21</a>–<a href="#f0045">57.22</a>). Two pairs of curved, tapering, collagenous, fila coronaria extend from the central fibrous body. They are stronger on the left, where they pass partially around the mitral and tricuspid orifices. These orifices are almost co-planar and incline to face the cardiac apex. In contrast, the aortic valve faces superiorly, lying anterosuperior and to the right of the mitral orifice. Two of the leaflets of the aortic valve (left coronary and non-adjacent) are in fibrous continuity with the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve; this subaortic curtain is also an integral part of the fibrous skeleton (see <a href="#f0195">Figs 57.21</a>–<a href="#f0050">57.23C</a>). The two ends of the fibrous curtain are strengthened as the right and left fibrous trigones, which are the strongest parts of the skeleton. The right trigone and the membranous septum constitute the central fibrous body, which is penetrated by the atrioventricular bundle (His). The membranous septum is crossed on its right aspect by the attachment of the tricuspid valve leaflets, dividing the septum into atrioventricular and interventricular parts.</div><div class="text" id="p0620">The aortic root is central within the fibrous skeleton and is often described in terms of an anulus integrated within the fibrous skeleton (<a href="#bib2" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_2">Anderson et al 2013</a>). However, as with the pulmonary valve, the structure of the aortic root corresponds to the triple fibrous semilunar attachments of its valvular leaflets. Within this complex circumferential zone, three crucially important triangular areas separate, on the ventricular aspect, the aortic sinuses that house the valvular leaflets (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 57.23</a>). Collectively, the three interleaflet triangles can be conceptualized in terms of a three-pointed coronet; their triangular apices correspond to the tips of the valvular commissures and their walls, significantly thinner than those of the aortic sinuses, consist variously of collagen or admixed muscle strands and fibroelastic tissue. They form the subvalvular extensions of the aortic vestibule. The first triangle is the interval between the non-adjacent and left coronary sinuses/leaflets that is filled with the deformable subaortic curtain. The second triangle between the non-adjacent and right coronary sinuses/leaflets is continuous with the anterior surface of the membranous septum. The third triangle, between the two coronary aortic sinuses/leaflets, is filled with loose fibroelastic tissue and separates the extension of the subaortic root from the wall of the free-standing subpulmonary infundibulum. The pulmonary valve possesses no fibrous continuity with the other three valves; however, in few cases a small fibrous band, known as the tendon of the conus, extends between the aortic and pulmonary valvar sinuses (<a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Saremi et al 2017</a>). Previously this was thought to be the location of the tendon of the infundibulum (conal ligament) (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Loukas et al 2007</a>); in mouse hearts, the ligament is found at the level of the sinutubular junctions at the site of initial fusion of the distal outflow cushions. The line of proximal fusion is the longitudinal raphe sometimes seen in the muscular subpulmonary infundibulum.</div><div class="text" id="p0625">Similar fibrous triangles separate the sinuses of the pulmonary trunk but they are significantly less robust. Use of the terms mitral and tricuspid anuli implies that the atrioventricular valves are supported by discrete circular fibrous rings, when, in reality, the valves are D-shaped structures integrally attached at the atrioventricular junctions. It is therefore inaccurate to consider these valvular orifices as circular. Rather, the straight edge of the ‘D’-shaped mitral valve represents a fibrous continuity between the aortic leaflet and the aortic root, and the remainder supports the mural leaflet. The straight edge of the ‘D’-shaped tricuspid valve represents the attachment of the septal leaflet, marking the inferior border of the triangle of Koch, and the remainder supports the anterosuperior and inferior leaflets. The attachments of the atrioventricular valves are not simple, rigid collagenous structures but dynamic, deformable lines that vary greatly at different peripheral points and change considerably with each phase of the cardiac cycle, and with increasing age. The tricuspid valvular leaflet attachments are even less robust than those of the mitral valve. At several sites, only fibroareolar tissue separates the atrial and ventricular muscular masses.</div><div class="text" id="p0630">The fibroadipose tissue of the fibrous skeleton provides electrical insulation between the atrial and ventricular walls, ensuring electrophysiological discontinuity between the atrial and ventricular myocardial masses, with the atrioventricular conduction axis being the only muscular structure crossing the plane of insulation (<a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Saremi et al 2017</a>).

One population is aligned so that the long axis of the aggregated cells is tangential to the epicardial and endocardial borders, albeit with marked variation in the angulation relative to the ventricular equator. Correlation with measurements taken using force probes shows that these myocytes produce the major unloading of the blood during ventricular systole. A second population is aligned at angles of up to 40° from the epicardium towards the endocardium and produces auxotonic forces during the cardiac cycle. Up to 40% of the cardiomyocyte chains in the ventricle are found to have a partially transmural alignment, which deviates from the prevailing tangential orientation of cardiomyocytes within the ventricles (<a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_28">Lunkenheimer et al 2018</a>).

Depending on the location of the shunt and the magnitude of left-to-right shunting, patients are at risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension unless timely corrective surgery is undertaken. Examples of defects leading to left-to-right shunting are simple atrial or ventricular septal defects or patent ductus arteriosus, or more complex atrioventricular septal defects, and/or a combination of any of these defects with abnormal atrioventricular or ventriculoarterial connections (e.g. a double-outlet right ventricle, where more than 50% of both the ascending aorta and the pulmonary trunk originate from the right ventricle).

Conduction of the impulse is rapid in the bundle and its branches (2–3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>m/s, compared to 0.6<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>m/s in normal myocardium). The cardiac impulse therefore arrives at the cardiac apex before spreading through the ventricular walls, producing a properly coordinated ventricular ejection. The human heart beats ceaselessly at an average of 70 cycles every minute for many decades, maintaining perfusion of pulmonary and systemic tissues. The rate and stroke volume fluctuate in response to prevailing physiological demands. The principal events in a cardiac cycle (valvular, phonocardiogram, electrocardiogram, pressure and mechanical) are summarized in <a href="#f0040">Fig. 57.20</a>.</div><div class="text" id="p0730">Cardiac efficiency depends on precise timing of the operation in interdependent structures. Passive diastolic filling of the atria and ventricles is followed by atrial systole, stimulated by discharge from the sinuatrial node, which completes ventricular filling. Excitation and contraction of the atria must be synchronous and finish before ventricular contraction; this is effected by a delay in the conduction of excitation from atria to ventricles. Thereafter, ventricular contraction proceeds in a precise manner. The atrioventricular valves are closed by ventricular systole, which must occur prior to closure; ventricular activation must therefore precede valvular closure, which spreads from the ventricular apices towards the outflow tracts and orifices.</div><div class="text" id="p0735">Cardiac contraction originates unequivocally in specialized cardiomyocytes, but neural influences are important in adapting the intrinsic cardiac rhythm to functional demands from the entire body. All cardiomyocytes are excitable. They display autonomous rhythmic depolarization and repolarization of their cell membranes, conduction of waves of excitation via gap junctions to adjacent cardiomyocytes, and excitation–contraction coupling to their actomyosin complexes. These properties are developed to different degrees in different sites and in different types of cardiomyocyte (<a href="../B9780702077050000069/B9780702077050000069.xhtml">Ch. 6</a>). The rate of depolarization and repolarization is slowest in the ventricular myocardium, intermediate in the atrial muscle, and fastest in the myocytes of the sinuatrial node. The latter override those generating slower rhythms and, in the normal heart, are the locus for the rhythmic initiation of cardiac cycles. Conversely, conduction velocity is slow in nodal myocytes, intermediate in the general population of working cardiac myocytes, and fastest in the myocytes of the ventricular conduction system.</div><div class="text" id="p0740">The nodes and networks of the specialized myocardial cells constitute the cardiac conduction system (see <a href="#f0030"><span class="bold">Fig. 57.18B</span></a><span class="bold">;</span> <a href="#f0075"><span class="bold">Figs 57.36</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0080"><span class="bold">57.37</span></a>). The parts of this system are the sinuatrial and atrioventricular nodes, the atrioventricular bundle with its left and right bundle branches, and the subendocardial plexus of ventricular conduction cells (Purkinje cells). The main pacemaker rhythm of the heart (sinus rhythm) is generated within the system but is influenced by autonomic nerves. It is transmitted specifically from atria to ventricles via the atrioventricular node and bundle. The spread of excitation is very rapid but not instantaneous. Different parts of the ventricles are excited at slightly different times, with important functional consequences. Failure of the conduction system will not block cardiac contraction but the system will become poorly coordinated. The rhythm will be slower because it originates from a spontaneous (myogenic) activity in the working cardiac myocytes or in a subsidiary pacemaker <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1088" id="pagebreak_1088"/><a id="pg1088"/>in a more distal part of the diseased or disrupted conduction system. There are no specialized internodal and interatrial conduction pathways; the excitation emanating from the sinuatrial node spreads to the atrial musculature and to the atrioventricular node through ordinary working atrial myocardium. The geometric arrangement of fibres along well-organized atrial muscle bundles (e.g., the terminal crest, the limbus of the fossa ovalis and the interatrial (Bachmann’s) bundle) provide a pathway for a marginally more rapid conduction than elsewhere within the atrium.</div><section><a id="sf0075"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0075"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000574/main.assets/f57-19-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0075"/><a id="fspara0075"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 57.36</span> Internal features and conduction system of the left side of the heart.

The main pathways for conduction towards the atrioventricular node are the crista terminalis and the limbus of the fossa ovalis. Conduction to the left atrium is preferentially through the interatrial (Bachmann’s) bundle; additional pathways occur through the limbus of the fossa ovalis and through the muscular connections between the walls of the coronary sinus and left atrium.

This reflects the fact that, although surgery for most of these defects has been available for the past four decades, surgery itself has not been curative; more often than not, patients develop conduction abnormalities and arrhythmia from surgical scars that cause haemodynamic problems such as chamber dilation and/or hypertrophy.

The right coronary artery passes at first anteriorly and slightly to the right between the right atrial auricle and pulmonary trunk. On reaching the atrioventricular sulcus, it descends almost vertically to the right side of the inferior cardiac border, curving around it into the inferior part of the sulcus in which it passes towards the cardiac crux (the junction of the atrioventricular, interatrial and interventricular sulci) (see <a href="#f0125">Fig. 57.4B</a>). The artery ends a little to the left of the crux, often by anastomosing with the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery. The right coronary artery may end near the right cardiac border, between this and the crux, or more often it reaches the left border, replacing the more distal part of the circumflex artery. Its branches supply the right and variable parts of the left chambers and atrioventricular septum. Usually, the first branch is the conal branch of the right coronary artery (<a href="#bib27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_27">Loukas et al 2014b</a>).

The ventricular arteries arise at almost 90∘ from the right coronary artery, an arrangement that is in marked contrast to the more acutely angled origins of the ventricular branches of the left coronary artery. The anterior ventricular branches, usually two or three, ramify towards the cardiac apex, but they rarely reach the apex unless the right marginal artery is included within this group. The right marginal artery is greater in calibre than the other anterior ventricular arteries and reaches the cardiac apex in most hearts. When it is very large, there may be no additional anterior ventricular branch. Two, sometimes three, small inferior ventricular branches, arise from the second segment of the right coronary artery between the right side of the inferior cardiac margin and cardiac crux to supply the inferior aspect of the right ventricle. Their size is inversely proportional to that of the right marginal artery, which usually extends to the inferior cardiac surface. On approaching the cardiac crux, the right coronary artery normally produces up to three inferior interventricular branches (occasionally none). The actual inferior interventricular artery sits within the interventricular sulcus, and may be flanked either to the right or left, or on both sides, by these parallel branches. When these flanking vessels exist, branches of the inferior interventricular artery are small and sparse. The inferior interventricular artery is occasionally replaced by a branch of the left coronary artery. Although the atrial branches of the right coronary artery are sometimes described as part of anterior, lateral (right or marginal) and posterior groups, they are usually small single vessels, 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm in diameter (<a href="#f0275"><span class="bold">Figs 57.46</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0285"><span class="bold">57.48</span></a>).

It may sometimes originate from the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery. It usually passes posteriorly in the groove between the right atrial auricle and ascending aorta, and branches around the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium, typically as an arterial loop from which small branches supply the right atrium.

Its initial portion, between its opening and first branches, varies in length from a few millimetres to a few centimetres. The artery lies between the pulmonary trunk and the left atrial auricle, emerging into the atrioventricular sulcus, where it turns left. This part is loosely embedded in subepicardial fat and usually has no branches, but may give off a small atrial branch and, rarely, the sinuatrial nodal artery.

Anterior right ventricular branches are small and rarely number more than one or two; the right ventricle is supplied almost entirely by the right coronary artery. Up to nine large left anterior ventricular arteries branch at acute angles from the anterior interventricular artery, crossing the anterior aspect of the left ventricle diagonally, with the largest reaching the rounded left (obtuse) cardiac border. One, termed the left diagonal artery, often dominates, sometimes arising separately from the left coronary artery, which then ends by trifurcation. It is reported in at least 33–50% of hearts, and may be doubled in around 20%. A small left conal artery frequently leaves the anterior interventricular artery near its origin, and anastomoses on the conus arteriosus with its counterpart from the right coronary artery and with the vasa vasorum of the pulmonary trunk and ascending aorta. The interventricular septal branches leave the anterior interventricular artery almost perpendicularly, and pass posteroinferiorly within the septum, usually supplying its anterior two-thirds. The first interventricular septal artery usually supplies the atrioventricular bundle at the point of its division into right and left bundles. Small inferiorly located interventricular septal branches from the same source supply the inferior third of the septum for a variable distance from the cardiac apex (<a href="#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Loukas et al 2009</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0975">The circumflex branch of the left coronary artery, comparable to the anterior interventricular artery in calibre, curves leftwards in the atrioventricular sulcus, and continues around the left cardiac border into the posterior and then inferior part of the sulcus, terminating to the left of the cardiac crux in most hearts, although sometimes continuing as the inferior interventricular artery. Proximally, the left atrial auricle usually overlaps it. A large ventricular branch, the left marginal artery, normally arises from the left circumflex artery at a 90∘ angle and branches over the rounded left border, supplying much of the adjacent left ventricle, typically to its apex. Smaller anterior and inferior branches of the circumflex artery also supply the left ventricle. Anterior ventricular branches (from one to five, commonly two or three) course parallel to the diagonal artery when it is present, and replace it when it is absent. Inferior ventricular branches are smaller and fewer because the left ventricle is partly supplied by the inferior interventricular branch of the right coronary artery. When this artery is small or absent, it is accompanied or replaced by often doubled or tripled interventricular continuations of the circumflex artery.</div><div class="text" id="p0980">The artery to the sinuatrial node is often derived from the first 1–2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm of the circumflex artery after its origin from the left coronary artery (anterior circumflex segment) and less often from the remaining length of the circumflex artery.

The artery to the atrioventricular node, sometimes the terminal branch of the circumflex artery (20%), arises near the cardiac crux. When this occurs, the circumflex artery usually gives off the inferior interventricular artery, an example of left dominance.</div></section><section><a id="s0475"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0415">Coronary arterial distribution</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0985">Details of coronary arterial distribution should be integrated into a concept of total cardiac supply. Most commonly, the right coronary artery supplies all of the right ventricle (except a narrow strip to the right of the anterior interventricular sulcus); a variable part of the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1092" id="pagebreak_1092"/>inferior aspect of the left ventricle; the inferior one-third of the interventricular septum; the right atrium and part of the left atrium; the conduction system as far as the proximal parts of the right and left bundles (branches of the atrioventricular bundle). Left coronary artery distribution is reciprocal and includes most of the left ventricle; a narrow strip of right ventricle; the anterior two-thirds of the interventricular septum; most of the left atrium. Variations in the coronary arterial system mainly affect the inferior aspect of the ventricles and reflect the relative dominance of coronary arterial supply (see <a href="#f0085">Fig. 57.41</a>). The term dominance is misleading because the left artery almost always supplies a greater volume of tissue than the right. In right dominance, the inferior interventricular artery is derived from the right coronary artery, and in left dominance it is derived from the left coronary artery. In the balanced pattern of supply, branches of both the left and right coronary arteries run in or near the inferior interventricular sulcus.</div><div class="text" id="p0990">Less is known about variations in atrial supply because the small vessels involved are not easily preserved in the corrosion casts that are used for analysis. In more than 50% of individuals, the right atrium is supplied by the right coronary artery alone. More than 62% of left atria are supplied mainly by the left coronary artery, 27% by the right coronary artery (in each group a small accessory supply from the other coronary artery exists) and 11% are supplied almost equally by both arteries. Arterial supply to the sinuatrial and atrioventricular nodes also varies: the sinuatrial node is supplied more often by the right coronary artery and fewer than 10% of sinuatrial nodes receive a bilateral supply. The atrioventricular node is usually supplied by the right coronary artery.</div><div class="text" id="p0995">Uncommonly, variants of coronary arteries may be present and are the second most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes. Anomalous origins of the coronary artery, particularly from the contralateral aortic sinus, are the variant that is most commonly associated with sudden cardiac death. Other anomalies include left coronary artery origin from the pulmonary trunk, coronary fistula and left main stem atresia (<a href="#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_19">Kastellanos et al 2018</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0480"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0420">Coronary anastomoses</h5><div class="textfl" id="p9876">The cardiac collateral circulation represents a built-in system for coronary arterial bypass. The first few centimetres of the main stems of the left and right coronary arteries are devoid of anastomotic branches. Collateral channels are abundant further distally, exhibiting variable calibres and occupying numerous locations, allowing for bidirectional flow between most arteries. Approximately 30 different sites of collateral extramural vessels have been described, the most frequent being at the cardiac apex; the anterior aspect of the right ventricle; the inferior aspect of the left ventricle; the cardiac crux; the interatrial and interventricular sulci; between the sinuatrial nodal and other atrial vessels (see <a href="#f0270">Figs 57.44</a>–<a href="#f0095">57.45</a>). Anastomoses between branches of the coronary arteries, both subepicardial and myocardial, and between these arteries and extracardiac vessels (see <a href="#f0310">Fig. 57.54</a>) are of great clinical importance. Clinical studies suggest that anastomoses cannot rapidly provide collateral routes sufficient to circumvent sudden coronary obstruction. Nevertheless, it has long been established that anastomoses do occur, particularly between fine subepicardial branches, and they may increase during the life of an individual by both angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. The Vieussens arterial ring is a collateral vessel that crosses the conus arteriosus inferior to the pulmonary trunk, and provides an anastomosis between the conal branches of the right coronary artery and the anterior interventricular artery. The artery to the sinuatrial node commonly provides a communication between the proximal parts of the left and right coronary arteries. The apical collateral artery joins the interventricular arteries. The frequent enlargement of the first interventricular septal branch of the anterior interventricular artery, Kugel’s anastomotic artery (arteria anastomotica auricularis magna), has been described as running between the proximal parts of the coronary arteries along the anterosuperior margin of the fossa ovalis to anastomose with the distal part of the right coronary artery.

The most common anastomoses are with the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery via the posterior pericardial reflections and reflect the close proximity of the bronchial arteries within the root of the lung. In pathological conditions, notably those resulting in pericardial adhesions, it is also possible for extracardiac anastomoses to develop through trans-pericardial vascularization. Extracardiac communications also exist with coronary atrial branches, especially the sinuatrial nodal artery. The effectiveness of any of these connections as collateral routes in coronary occlusion is not well quantified. Coronary arteriovenous anastomoses and numerous connections between the coronary circulation and cardiac cavities, producing so-called ‘myocardial sinusoids’ and ‘arterioluminal vessels’, have been reported, but their importance in coronary disease remains uncertain.</div></section><section><a id="s0490"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0430">Coronary angiography</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1030">Coronary angiography may be performed by introducing a catheter through the femoral, radial or brachial artery.

The exact position is guided by palpation of the femoral arterial pulse, and the needle is inserted at an angle of 45° to the artery. After arterial puncture, a fine guidewire is inserted through the needle and fed into the artery. The catheter is then inserted over the guidewire and passed through the external and common iliac arteries into the abdominal aorta, then through the descending thoracic aorta, aortic arch and ascending aorta. The brachial or radial artery may be used for percutaneous access to the circulation. Once the catheter is located in the ascending aorta, a variety of guidewires may be used to enter the coronary vessels for selective arteriography and interventions. Angiography is performed with standard high osmolality contrast medium and cine-angiography. In selected patients, new-generation, low osmolality contrast medium may be used. All the coronary arteries are catheterized and visualized in a variety of views to obtain a full evaluation of their anatomy and to determine the location and degree of any stenosis (<a href="#f0315"><span class="bold">Figs 57.55</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0320"><span class="bold">57.56</span></a>). The opening of the left coronary artery arises from the left aortic sinus and is best viewed in the direct frontal and left anterior oblique projections. The right anterior oblique view is useful in demonstrating the diagonal and anterior interventricular branches of the left coronary artery. The right coronary artery originates from the right aortic sinus and is usually visualized in the right anterior oblique view. Pressure and oxygen saturations can be measured via the catheter; changes in pressure across valves allow the degree of stenosis to be measured. Coronary blood flow and relative flow reserve can also be calculated. Significant stenosis may be treated initially by balloon angioplasty followed by stent insertion. The balloon exerts pressure against the plaque in the arterial wall, fracturing and splitting the plaque. The splinting effect of the plaque and elastic recoil are reduced, resulting in an increase in the arterial lumen. Stent insertion reduces the rate of re-stenosis.</div><div id="p1035"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0315"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000574/main.assets/on57-35-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0320"/><a id="fspara0335"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 57.55</span> A right coronary angiogram showing several branches of the right coronary artery.

Patients with high-grade lesions, left main stem coronary artery or triple-vessel disease with impaired left ventricular function are usually considered for coronary artery bypass grafting. The common grafts that are used are the internal thoracic (mammary) and radial arteries. The left internal thoracic artery and radial artery grafts have a greater patency rate than saphenous vein grafts. Approximately 15% of saphenous vein grafts occlude in 1 year and, from then on, at an annual rate of 1–2% in the first 6 years and 4% thereafter; between 40% and 50% of saphenous vein grafts have occluded by 10 years, whereas only about 10% of left internal thoracic or radial artery grafts will have occluded over this time. The common surgical approach is via a midline sternotomy (<a href="../B9780702077050000537/B9780702077050000537.xhtml">Ch. 53</a>). If the internal thoracic artery is used as a donor graft, it is divided distally (maintaining its proximal origin from the subclavian artery) and anastomosed to the coronary artery distal to the stenosis. If radial artery grafts are used, they must bridge the stenosis via both proximal and distal anastomoses. In selected cases, minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting is performed, but the approach is dependent on the vessel being grafted. The anterior approach, via a mini-thoracotomy through the left fourth intercostal space, is used for grafting the left anterior interventricular and diagonal arteries. The anterolateral approach, via an incision in the left third intercostal space from the mid-clavicular to anterior axillary lines, is used for grafting early marginal branches of the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery. The lateral approach, via a lateral thoracotomy measuring only 10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm in size through the left fifth or sixth intercostal spaces, allows grafting of the circumflex vessels. Extrathoracic approaches that are occasionally used include the subxiphoid approach for the distal part of the right coronary artery and inferior interventricular artery. The vast majority of patients are treated with stent placement (<a href="#f0325"><span class="bold">Fig. 57.57</span></a>).

Efferent postganglionic fibres pass to the cardiac plexus as the cervical and thoracic cardiac nerves (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Kawashima 2005</a>), and then travel with the coronary vasculature towards the endocardium. When stimulated, they release noradrenaline (norepinephrine) that activates beta-adrenergic receptors in the cardiac tissue (<a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_22">Linz et al 2014</a>). The resultant effect is an increase in conduction speed in the atrioventricular node as well as increased heart rate and force of cardiac muscular contractions. Sympathetic innervation increases heart rate and dilates the coronary arteries, whereas parasympathetic vagal innervation has the opposite effect.</div><div class="text" id="p1170">Baroreceptors (mechanoreceptors) located in the adventitia of the aortic wall and carotid sinus detect intra-arterial pressure changes.

The sympathetic nervous system is overly active in patients with heart failure and certain therapies targeting this pathway have reduced mortality rates.

Parasympathetic innervation of the cardiac musculature is mediated by cholinergic muscarinic receptors that function dissimilarly to those of the sympathetic adrenergic beta receptors (<a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Linz et al 2014</a>). Experimental evidence suggests that groups of vagal preganglionic neurones originating in the nucleus ambiguus and dorsal vagal nucleus control the heart rate and atrioventricular conductance (via their innervation of nodal tissue) and modulate the contractility and excitability of the ventricular myocardium (<a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Gourine et al 2016</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1180">Preganglionic cardiac parasympathetic axons arising from either the dorsal vagal nucleus or the nucleus ambiguus run in cervical cardiac branches of the vagus nerve to synapse in the cardiac plexuses and atrial walls. Intrinsic cardiac neurones are limited to the atria and interatrial septum, and are most numerous in the subepicardial connective tissue near the sinuatrial and atrioventricular nodes. There is evidence that these intrinsic ganglia are not simple nicotinic relays but may act as sites for integration of extrinsic nervous inputs and form complex circuits for the local neuronal control of the heart and perhaps even local reflexes. Postganglionic neurones distributed within discrete fat pads on the atrial surface can mediate cardiac function. The ganglion cells in a fat pad adjacent to the epicardium of the right pulmonary veins selectively mediate negative chronotropic effects whereas ganglion cells in a fat pad at the junction between the inferior aspect of the right atrium and the inferior vena cava mediate the slowing of atrioventricular conduction (<a href="#bib43" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_43">Sánchez-Quintana et al 2014</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0615"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0530">Cardiac plexus</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1185">Nearing the heart, the autonomic nerves form a mixed cardiac plexus, usually described in terms of a superficial part inferior to the aortic arch, lying between the arch and the right pulmonary artery, and a deep part between the aortic arch and the tracheal bifurcation. The cardiac plexus is also described with reference to regional names for its coronary, pulmonary, atrial and aortic extensions (<a href="#f0110"><span class="bold">Fig. 57.61</span></a>). Ganglion cells are largely confined to the atrial tissues, with a preponderance adjacent to the sinuatrial node, but some may also be found within the heart along the branches of the plexuses. Their axons are considered to be largely, if not exclusively, postganglionic parasympathetic. Cholinergic and adrenergic fibres, arising in or passing through the cardiac plexus, are distributed most profusely to the sinuatrial and atrioventricular nodes; the supply to the atrial and ventricular myocardium is much less dense. Adrenergic fibres supply the coronary arteries and cardiac veins.
