The lower limb is connected to the axial skeleton via the sacroiliac joint, a joint that consists of syndesmotic and synovial parts, and in which mobility has been sacrificed for stability and strength to allow for effective weight transmission from the trunk to the lower limb. Anteriorly, the two pubic bones are united at the pubic symphysis, a secondary cartilaginous joint that may display a slight degree of mobility during hip and sacroiliac movement, and during late pregnancy and childbirth. The hip joint is a synovial ball-and-socket articulation, and exhibits an effective compromise between mobility and stability that allows movement in all three orthogonal planes. The more distal joints have gained mobility at the expense of stability. The knee joint includes a complex synovial joint between the femur and the tibia, and a plane joint between the femur and the patella. This permits a range of up to about 140° of active flexion, extension to neutral or beyond, and voluntary medial and lateral rotation (approximately 60–70°) of the leg. The tibia and fibula articulate with each other at the superior and inferior tibiofibular joints. The superior joint, a plane synovial joint, allows slight gliding movement only. The inferior fibrous joint lies just above the ankle and allows a degree of fibular rotation linked to ankle motion. The ankle (talocrural) joint is formed by the distal ends of the tibia and fibula ‘gripping’ the talus, and enables about 70° of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. There are multiple joints in the foot that may be classified topographically on the basis of whether they are in the hindfoot, midfoot or forefoot. Collectively, these joints allow the complex movements required as the foot fulfils its functional roles as a platform for standing and for shock absorption and propulsion in gait. The terminology used to describe motion of the ankle and foot, especially with respect to defining supination/pronation and inversion/eversion, is inconsistent (<a href="#bib48" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_48">Greiner 2007,</a> <a href="#bib46" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_46">Doya et al 2010</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p2003">Both the knee and ankle are commonly subject to closed injuries, and the relatively superficial location of the knee renders it susceptible to open injury and infection. Although the ankle is frequently injured and is a major load-bearing joint, the incidence of clinically significant degenerative arthritis is surprisingly low when compared with that found in the hip and knee joints.</div></section><section><a id="s0015"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0025">Skin and Fascia</h2><div class="textfl" id="p2004">In the young adult and as an adaptation to weight-bearing, the skin of the lower limb is generally thicker than that of the upper limb. The soft tissues of the sole of the foot are particularly thickened in order to support weight during standing. The skin of the buttocks and posterior <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1334" id="pagebreak_1334"/><a id="pg1333.e1"/>thigh bears weight in the sitting position and is relatively thick. The skin over the anteromedial aspect of the leg is particularly fragile and vulnerable in the elderly.</div><div class="text" id="p2005">The superficial fascia (subcutaneous tissue; tela subcutanea; hypodermis) of the lower limb becomes thinner distally. It provides support for subcutaneous structures such as superficial veins and cutaneous nerves, and is connected to the adventitia of the superficial veins by thin bands that prevent the displacement of the veins during movement. The hypodermal plexus of arteries and veins controls blood flow through the skin, helping to regulate body temperature (<a href="#bib106" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_106">Sterzi 1910</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p2006">The deep fascia of the gluteal region varies in thickness. The deep fascia of the thigh and leg is a well-defined layer that forms a tough circumferential ‘stocking-like’ structure that constrains the musculature (<a href="#f0115"><span class="bold">Fig. 76.3</span></a>). It is attached to the medial and lateral intermuscular septa in the thigh, the patellar ligament, patella, tibial tuberosity and condyles, the head of the fibula at the knee, and the periosteum of the tibia, fibular head and lateral malleolus. The iliotibial tract, medial and lateral patellar retinacula, and the extensor, flexor and fibular retinacula at the ankle are important condensations. Septa pass from the deep surface of this fascial sheath to the bones within, defining discrete (osteofascial) compartments that contain functional muscle groups. The intermuscular septa and the interosseous membrane between the tibia and fibula also provide additional areas for the attachment of muscles.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0115"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000768/main.assets/f76-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0115"/><a id="fspara0115"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 76.3</span> The deep fascia of the lower limb. <span class="bold">A</span>, Anterior view. <span class="bold">B</span>, Posterior view. <br/><span class="figcredit">A, B, Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy © Elsevier GmbH, Urban &amp; Fischer, Munich.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div id="p2348"/><div class="text" id="p2150">The muscles of the thigh may be grouped into three compartments according to their function: anterior (extensor), medial (adductor) and posterior (flexor). Only the anterior and posterior compartments possess distinct fascial boundaries. A definite fascial separation into anterior (extensor), posterior (flexor) and lateral (evertor) compartments exists in the leg, and compartment syndrome is most common in this region (see below). The deep and superficial muscles in the flexor compartment of the leg are separated by the transverse intermuscular septum. The compartments of the foot, one on the dorsal aspect and four on the plantar surface, are described in <a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793.xhtml#c0079">Chapter 79</a>.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1335" id="pagebreak_1335"/><a id="pg1335"/></div><div class="text" id="p2152">Vessels and nerves run through all of the compartments and supply the muscles contained within them. The muscles acting within these closed compartments assist in maintaining the anti-gravity flow of venous blood.</div><div class="text" id="p2009">According to <a href="#bib42" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_42">Cruveilhier (1841)</a>, all aponeurotic fasciae, including the deep fascia of the lower limb, are put under tension by specific myofascial expansions (more evident around joints) or dedicated muscles (e.g. tensor fasciae latae). These thickenings may act functionally as additional tendons. The pattern of soft tissue organization has a bearing on the physiological effects of the muscles and is crucial for efficient venous return from the limb. The fascial planes also control and direct the spread of pathological fluids (blood, pus) within the limb and play an important part in determining the degree and direction of displacement seen in long bone fractures.</div><div class="text" id="p2010">The fascial boundaries that limit the compartments are largely inelastic, which means that any acute condition that leads to an increase in the volume of the compartmental contents, e.g. muscle swelling caused by trauma, haemorrhage or local infection, is likely to cause an increase in intracompartmental pressure. If unrelieved, this increased pressure will lead to compressive occlusion of the vessels in the compartment and consequent ischaemic damage to the nerves and muscles of the compartment, a phenomenon known as acute compartment syndrome. Chronic exertional compartment syndrome is characterized by exercise-induced leg pain that usually subsides with rest, thought to be caused by elevated intramuscular pressure that may result in decreased tissue perfusion, ischaemia and transient neurological impairments (<a href="#bib33" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_33">Burrus et al 2015</a>). The normal compartmental pressure of the leg is significantly higher in children than in adults: the average pressure in the compartments, measured when supine, varies between 13.3 and 16.6<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mmHg in children, compared with 5.2 and 9.7<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mmHg in adults (<a href="#bib105" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_105">Staudt et al 2008</a>).

Surgical decompression of the fasciae of the restricting compartment may be necessary; in order to prevent neurovascular injury during a fasciotomy, the exact course of the nerves and vessels within the affected compartment must be known (<a href="#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_21">Apaydin et al 2008</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0030">Muscles</h2><div class="textfl" id="p2012">The effects of extension and medial rotation of the limb that occur during fetal development are manifest in the relative positions of the muscle groups in the thigh and the leg, and in the adult pattern of segmental cutaneous innervation (dermatomes). The role of the muscles of the lower limb in the maintenance of equilibrium during gait and in stance is rarely emphasized sufficiently. Many of the muscles act frequently or predominantly from their distal attachments. During both stance and gait, the distal attachment is often fixed and the proximal attachment is mobile, e.g. the predominant action of gluteus medius is as a pelvic stabilizer rather than as a hip abductor. In contrast, in the upper limb, the proximal muscle attachments are usually fixed and the distal attachments are mobile, an arrangement that is consistent with the prehensile function of the hand. The lower limb contains many muscles that act on more than one joint, and it is unusual for any joint of the lower limb to move in isolation. Certain muscles are morphologically and functionally segregated, e.g. the anterior part of gluteus medius is active with medial (internal) rotation of the hip, while the posterior part contributes to lateral (external) rotation of the hip.</div><div class="text" id="p2013">Muscles of the lower limb may be subdivided according to their location. (1) Muscles of the iliac region, psoas major and iliacus (together called iliopsoas) are the main flexors of the hip. They arise from the lumbar spine and inner surface of the ilium and are attached distally on the lesser trochanter of the femur. When present, psoas minor runs from the lumbar spine to the pubis. (2) The gluteal region includes the three named gluteal muscles and the deeper, short lateral rotators of the hip joint. Gluteus maximus lies most superficially and is a powerful extensor of the hip joint. Gluteus medius and minimus, passing between the ilium and the greater trochanter of the femur, are abductors of the hip. Their most important action is to stabilize the pelvis on the femur during gait, helped by tensor fasciae latae. Two of the short lateral rotators of the hip, piriformis and obturator internus, arise from within the pelvis, while the others, obturator externus, the gemelli and quadratus femoris, originate externally; all of these muscles are attached distally to the proximal femur. (3) The muscles of the thigh lie in three functional compartments. The anterior (extensor) compartment includes sartorius and quadriceps femoris (rectus femoris and vasti medialis, lateralis and intermedius). Sartorius and rectus femoris are attached proximally to the pelvis and can thus act on the hip joint as well as on the knee, whereas the vasti arise from the femoral shaft and are powerful knee extensors. The medial (adductor) compartment contains adductors brevis, longus and magnus and gracilis; pectineus may also be included. All five muscles cross the hip joint but only gracilis reaches beyond the knee. The muscles of the posterior (flexor) compartment, semitendinosus, semimembranosus and biceps femoris, are attached proximally to the ischial tuberosity and act to extend the hip and to flex and rotate the knee. Part of adductor magnus, as may be inferred from the extent of its proximal attachment and its dual innervation, shares the first of these functions with the hamstrings. Biceps femoris is the only muscle of the thigh that is attached distally to the fibula. (4) In the leg, the anterior (extensor) compartment includes the extensors (dorsiflexors) of the foot and the extrinsic toe extensors. Tibialis anterior, the main foot dorsiflexor, also inverts the foot at the subtalar joint, while the smallest muscle of the compartment, fibularis (peroneus) tertius, is a dorsiflexor that everts the foot. The lateral compartment contains the main evertors of the foot, fibularis (peroneus) longus and brevis; both muscles are also plantar flexors. The posterior (flexor/plantar flexor) compartment has superficial and deep components. The superficial component contains gastrocnemius, soleus and plantaris. Gastrocnemius and soleus are powerful plantar flexors of the foot: gastrocnemius and plantaris are attached proximally to the femur and distally to the calcaneus and can therefore act on the knee as well as at the ankle. The deep component of the flexor compartment contains popliteus, a rotator of the knee, tibialis posterior, the main invertor of the foot, and the extrinsic flexors of the toes. (5) The intrinsic muscles of the foot include one muscle on the dorsal surface (extensor digitorum brevis), and the muscles of the sole, arranged in four layers. The intrinsic muscles facilitate the actions of the extrinsic flexors of the toes, and provide subtle changes in the shape of the foot, thereby contributing to the control of foot posture during stance and gait.</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0035">Vascular Supply and Lymphatic Drainage</h2><div class="textfl" id="p2014">The detailed regional descriptions of these systems are found in <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#c0077">Chapters 77</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000781/B9780702077050000781.xhtml#c0078">78</a> and <a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793.xhtml#c0079">79</a>.</div><section><a id="s0030"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0040">Arteries</h3><div class="textfl" id="p2015">The femoral artery (the continuation of the external iliac artery) provides the principal arterial supply to the lower limb distal to the inguinal ligament and the gluteal fold (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Figs 76.4</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">76.5</span></a>).

To achieve tissue coverage for deeper and larger tissue defects, one of a variety of autologous tissue flaps may be used. A fasciocutaneous flap is composed of skin, fat and deep fascia (fascia musculorum); a lower-extremity fasciocutaneous flap (<a href="#bib90" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_90">Pontén 1981</a>) is very useful in the repair of soft tissue defects of the leg.</div><div class="text" id="p2019">The viability of a flap transplanted from one part of the body to another is crucially dependent on the blood supply of the flap.

Their valves are arranged so as to prevent flow of blood from the deep to the superficial veins. At rest, pressure in a superficial vein is equal to the height of the column of blood extending from that vein to the heart. When the posterior leg muscles contract, blood is pumped proximally into the deep veins and is normally prevented from flowing into the superficial veins by the valves in the perforating veins. During muscular relaxation, blood is drawn into the deep veins from the superficial veins. If the valves in the perforating veins become incompetent, these veins become sites of ‘high-pressure leaks’ during muscular contraction, and the superficial veins become dilated and varicose. There are similar perforating connections in the anterolateral region, where varicosities may also occur. Incompetence of the valves in the connecting veins between the long saphenous vein and femoral vein in the adductor canal may predispose to superficial varicosities along the medial aspect of the thigh (<a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_44">Dodd and Cockett 1976</a>).

Temporary lesions may occur after pregnancy and childbirth, e.g. after difficult forceps delivery of a large baby. Pain, which may be diffuse, is the most common feature.

The so-called piriformis syndrome, which may result from a variant or anomalous relationship between piriformis and the sciatic nerve, may also produce hip pain that radiates inferiorly along the course of the sciatic nerve. Diagnosis of specific nerve injuries relies on the distribution and characteristics of clinical findings in combination with supportive electrophysiological studies and/or MRI and CT scans. The clinical presentation of lesions can vary as a result of anatomical variation and overlapping innervation patterns.

Any muscle to be tested must satisfy a number of criteria. It should be visible, so that wasting or fasciculation can be observed, and the muscle consistency with contraction can be felt. It should have an isolated action, so that its function can be tested separately. It should help to differentiate between lesions at different levels in the neural axis and in the peripheral nerve, or between peripheral nerves. It should be tested in such a way that normal can be differentiated from abnormal, so that slight weakness can be detected early with reliability. Some preference should be given to muscles with an easily elicited reflex. <a href="#t0025">Table 76.4</a> gives a list of movements and muscles chosen according to these criteria; in practice, these tests would be combined with tests of sensory function.

The gait cycle is usually defined as the interval between initial heel contact of one foot to the successive heel contact of the same foot. The terms used to describe the point at which the foot makes first contact with the ground varies. Heel contact or heel strike are used in some instances, but individuals with altered or pathological gait patterns may not be able to initiate contact with their heel (<a href="#bib116" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_116">Wall et al 1987</a>) and therefore the terms initial contact or foot strike are also common. Each gait cycle consists of two steps which together constitute a stride, and can be divided into two main phases: stance phase (when the foot is in contact with the ground) and swing phase (when the foot is off the ground).</div><div class="text" id="p2069">At normal walking speed, the stance phase accounts for approximately 60% of the gait cycle, and swing phase occupies 40%. There are two single-limb support phases (where one foot is on the ground) which alternate with two periods of double-limb support (where both feet are on the ground simultaneously; at 0–10% and 50–60% of the gait cycle) (<a href="#f0075"><span class="bold">Fig. 76.15</span></a>).

The gait cycle starts with heel contact, the point at which the heel meets the ground. With the foot still positioned in front of the body, foot flat (where the entire plantar surface of the foot is in contact with the ground) is reached, at approximately 10% of the gait cycle. This is sometimes also referred to as the ‘loading response’. Transition is made to mid stance, the point at which the body’s weight is aligned directly above the planted foot (at approximately 30% of the gait cycle). The point at which the heel rises off the ground is termed heel off (between approximately 30% and 40% of the gait cycle), and this occurs just before the contralateral foot makes contact with the ground (the double stance phase). The last event of stance is toe off defined as the instant the toes come off the ground (60% of the gait cycle). Push off is a term used to describe the period of ankle plantar flexion (approximately 40–60% of the gait cycle), but there is a lack of consensus on the primary functional role of this phase of gait (<a href="#bib122" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_122">Zelik and Adamczyk 2016</a>). The swing phase typically comprises three events: early (or initial), mid and late (or terminal) swing. Early swing encompasses the period between toe off to mid swing (60–75% of the gait cycle). Mid swing occurs slightly before to just after the mid stance phase of the opposite limb (approximately 75–85% of the gait cycle) and late swing encompasses the period from the end of mid swing through to heel contact (85–100% of the gait cycle) (<a href="#bib103" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_103">Simoneau and Heiderscheit 2017</a>) (see <a href="#f0075">Fig. 76.15</a>).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0230"/><section><a id="s0235"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0185">Joint kinematics and muscle activity</h3><div class="textfl" id="p2053">The following provides an overview of lower limb joint kinematics of the pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle and foot during gait, along with associated muscle activity in each of the three planes.

Most of the data relating to muscle activity are derived from electromyographic studies, and relate to walking at a normal speed of about 1.3–1.4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>m/sec (<a href="#bib86" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_86">Murray et al 1964</a>, <a href="#bib30" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_30">Bohannon 1997</a>).

At heel contact the pelvis is neutral, moving into a small amount of posterior pelvic tilt during the first period of double limb support. The pelvis then tilts anteriorly, reaching a position of anterior pelvic tilt just after mid stance. During the second half of the stance phase, the pelvis tilts posteriorly until around toe off. This changes to anterior pelvic tilt during early to mid swing, and then to posterior pelvic tilt in late swing (<a href="#bib112" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_112">Thurston and Harris 1983</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p2056">A total excursion of about 10–15° of pelvic movement occurs in the coronal plane, termed ‘pelvic-on-femoral (hip) abduction and adduction’, in relation to the stance limb (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#c0077">Ch. 77</a>, ‘Movements’). During weight acceptance the contralateral side of the pelvis drops (pelvic on femoral adduction), due to the effect of body weight, controlled by eccentric activity of the hip abductors on the stance limb. During the remainder of the stance phase (20–60% of the gait cycle), the contralateral side of the pelvis (swing limb) is elevated (pelvic on femoral abduction) by concentric contraction of the hip abductors.</div><div class="text" id="p2057">In the horizontal plane, pelvic rotation occurs around a vertical axis of rotation (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Baker 2001</a>). The total amount of pelvic rotation varies (range approximately 4–14°), and it is uncertain if differences exist between sexes. At heel contact of the right foot, the ipsilateral anterior superior iliac spine is further forward compared with its contralateral counterpart. Pelvic rotation occurs in a medial (internal, counterclockwise) direction for the first 15–20% of the gait cycle, and then changes to lateral (external, clockwise) rotation, whereby the contralateral anterior superior iliac spine moves forward along with the swing limb (<a href="#bib103" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Simoneau and Heiderscheit 2017</a>). The anterior portions of gluteus medius and gluteus minimus contribute to the forward contralateral rotation of the pelvis (<a href="#bib96" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_96">Semciw et al 2013</a>, <a href="#bib97" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_97">2014</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0245"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0195">Hip</h4><div class="textfl" id="p2058">In the sagittal plane, the hip moves through two arcs of motion during a normal stride, being extended during stance and flexed through the swing phase. The total range of motion is approximately 40–50°, with an average of 30–40° flexion and 5–10° extension. Maximum hip flexion is reached just before heel contact, at which stage the hip starts to extend in preparation for weight acceptance. Hip extension is produced by gluteus maximus (active in the first 30% of the gait cycle, from heel contact through to mid stance), and the hamstring muscles (active during the first 10% of gait cycle), with some assistance from adductor magnus during weight acceptance (<a href="#bib76" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_76">Lyons et al 1983</a>) (see <a href="#f0125">Fig. 76.16</a>). At heel contact, gluteus maximus also acts to control trunk flexion. The hip progressively extends as the body moves forward over the fixed foot, with maximum hip extension occurring just before toe off. Hip flexion is initiated at push off, and during the swing phase the hip flexors (including iliopsoas, rectus femoris and sartorius), assisted initially by the hip adductors, function to move the lower limb forwards and to elevate it to enable toe clearance. Iliopsoas activates before toe off, and together with the other hip flexors is active throughout approximately the first 50% of the swing phase (<a href="#bib62" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_62">Keagy et al 1966</a>, <a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Andersson et al 1997</a>); hip flexion during the second half of the swing phase occurs as a result of forward momentum obtained in early swing. The hip extensors contract eccentrically late in swing to decelerate the flexing hip.</div><div class="text" id="p2059">As described in relation to pelvic kinematics, hip motion in the coronal plane during stance primarily occurs through ‘pelvic-on-femoral’ abduction and adduction. Gluteus medius and gluteus minimus, the two primary hip abductor muscles, demonstrate two bursts of activity during stance, and are most active during the first 40% of the gait cycle (see <a href="#f0125">Fig. 76.16</a>). These muscles initially function eccentrically to control the lowering of the contralateral pelvis on the side of the swing limb. They then contract concentrically, and are critical to ensuring frontal pelvic stability across the stance phase, particularly during single limb support (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#c0077">Ch. 77</a>). During the swing phase the hip returns to its neutral frontal plane position, achieved through a combination of the motion of the pelvis (about the stance limb) and that of the advancing femur.</div><div class="text" id="p2060">Hip medial and lateral rotation in the horizontal plane equates to approximately 6–7° in each direction. At heel contact, the femur is slightly laterally rotated. For most of the stance phase (the first 50% of the gait cycle) a net medial rotation movement occurs at the hip, as the contralateral pelvis is moved forward in the horizontal plane by the medial rotator muscles (tensor fasciae latae, anterior gluteus medius and gluteus minimus). This muscle group, together with the lateral rotators (six short lateral rotators, posterior gluteus medius, gluteus maximus), control the alignment of the hip in the horizontal plane. In particular, eccentric contraction of the lateral rotators may be important in controlling medial rotation of the lower limb during early stance. From early to mid-swing, the hip rotates laterally as the lower limb advances forward, and from mid swing to heel contact slight medial rotation is apparent.</div></section><section><a id="s0250"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0200">Knee</h4><div class="textfl" id="p2061">The knee moves through a total sagittal range of motion from nearly full extension to approximately 65° flexion during the gait cycle (<a href="#bib32" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_32">Bruening et al 2015</a>). At heel contact, the knee is flexed slightly (approximately 5°), and continues to flex during the initial 15% of the gait cycle, to reach about 15–20°. This slight knee flexion contributes to shock absorption during weight acceptance onto the stance limb, and is controlled by eccentric activity of the quadriceps muscles (see <a href="#f0125">Fig. 76.16</a>). As body weight is transferred onto the stance limb, the knee gradually extends via contraction of the quadriceps muscles, attaining near full extension at the end of stance. The knee then begins to flex, serving to shorten the lower limb so to facilitate toe clearance, reaching 35° flexion at toe off and maximum flexion of approximately 60° at mid swing. Most of the knee flexion during swing occurs passively as a result of the hip flexing, with a potential small contribution from the plantar flexor muscles (<a href="#bib119" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_119">Winter 1983</a>, <a href="#bib108" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_108">Sutherland 2001</a>). Between mid to late swing the knee extends, nearly reaching full extension, and then begins to flex slightly just before heel contact. In the period just before to just after heel contact, the hamstrings contract eccentrically to decelerate knee extension. Co-contraction of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles in early stance, push off and late swing (highest levels of muscle excitation) (see <a href="#f0125">Fig. 76.16</a>) preserve knee joint stability during normal gait (<a href="#bib107" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_107">Strazza et al 2017</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p2062">The knee is relatively stable in the coronal plane, but variation is evident in the direction of the reported motions. The knee is abducted slightly at heel contact (<a href="#bib69" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_69">Lafortune et al 1992</a>) and moves through a small range (approximately 3°) of inconsistent abduction–adduction during the first 80% of stance, with up to 5° of adduction apparent throughout the final 20% of stance (<a href="#bib60" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_60">Ishii et al 1997</a>, <a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_26">Benoit et al 2007</a>).

The tibia is rotated laterally just before heel contact, with medial rotation initiated at heel contact and sustained during the first 25% of stance. At mid stance the tibiofemoral joint is close to neutral, with lateral tibial rotation occurring in conjunction with the final 30° of extension, an event referred to as the ‘screw home’ movement or rotation (<a href="#bib72" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_72">Levens et al 1948</a>).

At heel contact the foot is positioned in neutral or slight plantar flexion (0–5°). A short phase of rapid plantar flexion follows during the first 8% of the gait cycle, controlled by the eccentric activity of the ankle dorsiflexors (tibialis anterior, extensors digitorum longus and hallucis longus), enabling the foot to be positioned flat on the ground (<a href="#bib47" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_47">Gray and Basmajian 1968</a>, <a href="#bib59" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_59">Hunt et al 2001</a>). During stance (8–45% of the gait cycle), dorsiflexion occurs as the tibia moves forward over the foot. Dorsiflexion in this phase of gait reaches a maximum of approximately 10°, and is controlled by the plantar flexor muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus) which work eccentrically from just after foot flat to heel off to control the forward progression of the leg (see <a href="#f0125">Fig. 76.16</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p2065">Just after heel off, the ankle begins to plantar flex due to concentric plantar flexion muscle contraction (including fibularis longus), with a major burst of activity occurring around push off (see <a href="#f0125">Fig. 76.16</a>): there are contrasting opinions as to whether push off contributes to the production of forward motion of the body during normal gait (centre of mass acceleration) and/or acceleration of leg swing (<a href="#bib57" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_57">Hof et al 1992</a>, <a href="#bib122" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Zelik and Adamczyk 2016</a>). As the heel leaves the ground, gradual extension (up to 45°) occurs at the metatarsophalangeal joints. Due to the indirect connections between the deep plantar fascia and the toes, extension, of the great toe particularly, increases tension throughout the medial longitudinal arch (referred to as the ‘windlass effect’). Maximum plantar flexion (approximately 15–20°) occurs just after toe off. During swing phase the ankle dorsiflexors (particularly tibialis anterior) contract concentrically to return the ankle to a neutral position, allowing the toes to clear the ground (<a href="#bib120" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_120">Winter and Yack 1987</a>). The intrinsic muscles of the foot are active from mid stance to toe off, stabilizing the forefoot and raising the medial longitudinal arch (see <a href="#f0125">Fig. 76.16</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p2159">In the coronal plane interaction between the subtalar and transverse tarsal joints results in the tri-planar movements of supination and pronation. At heel contact, the subtalar joint is inverted (approximately 2–3°), and then rapidly everts until mid stance (<a href="#bib59" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Hunt et al 2001</a>). Tibialis posterior is active throughout most of the stance phase, with muscle activity peaking from just after heel contact and then again at about 35% of the gait cycle (see <a href="#f0125">Fig. 76.16</a>). This muscle acts to resist pronation of the hindfoot (calcaneus and talus), and works synergistically with fibularis longus, to assist with mediolateral foot stability (<a href="#bib84" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_84">Murley et al 2009</a>, <a href="#bib85" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_85">2014</a>). Following mid stance, the subtalar joint reverses its direction of movement, inverting (through concentric invertor muscle activity) to reach a neutral position about the time of heel off (<a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_22">Arndt et al 2004</a>). Calcaneal inversion continues between heel off and toe off to reach approximately 6° of inversion, and during swing the hind foot returns to a slightly inverted position prior to heel contact.</div><div class="text" id="p2066">Little ankle and foot movement occurs in the horizontal plane, and so this is not considered in this section.</div></section><section><a id="s0260"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0210">Development of walking</h4><div class="textfl" id="p2067">The average child sits at 6 months, crawls at 9 months, walks with support at 10 months and walks without support around 12–14 months.

Early gait is jerky, unsteady and wide-based. Initial ground contact varies, and heel–toe, whole foot and toe–heel are all possible. Generally, a plantar flexed posture is adopted, which contrasts with the adult pattern. In adults, heel contact is accompanied by a straight knee which then flexes. A child strikes the ground with a flexed knee which is then extended in response to weight-bearing, and a short time is spent in single-leg stance (<a href="#f0130"><span class="bold">Fig. 76.17</span></a>). The earliest changes are development of heel contact, knee flexion during stance, adult pattern of joint angles and reciprocal upper limb swing.

This decrease in speed is a function of both a shorter step length and an increase in time spent in the double-limb support phase; step width also increases thereby increasing the base of support, and gait becomes more variable and asymmetrical due to stride-to-stride fluctuations (<a href="#bib75" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_75">Lord et al 2013</a>).

This results in an aerial phase – the ‘double-float’ phase – when neither foot is on the ground, a feature that demarcates running from walking. An increase in running speed is generally the result of taking longer strides and increasing stride frequency (<a href="#bib45" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_45">Dorn et al 2012</a>). The faster an individual runs, the shorter the stance phase, with the main difference between running and sprinting being the acceleration at the start of a sprint (<a href="#bib55" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_55">Haugen et al 2019</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p5075">The stance and swing phases of the running gait cycle can be divided into a number of key events that include heel contact, mid stance, heel off, toe off and mid swing (<a href="#bib56" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_56">Heiderscheit and Simoneau 2017</a>). The start of the running cycle is defined as the instant the foot comes into contact with the ground, often referred to as foot strike. This can occur in three ways, with either the rearfoot (hindfoot or heel), midfoot or forefoot contacting the ground first; the rearfoot strike pattern is most common, accounting for up to approximately 85% of all runners (<a href="#bib73" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_73">Lieberman et al 2010</a>, <a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Almeida et al 2015</a>). Mid stance occurs when the body’s weight is aligned directly above the planted foot or when the knees are side by side (at approximately 20% of the gait cycle), with the ‘loading response’ occupying the first 15% of the cycle. The timing of heel off (approximately 25% of the cycle) and toe off (30–40% of the cycle) varies with running speed.

Rectus femoris appears as a raised ridge passing down the anterior aspect of the thigh to the base of the patella, when the sitting subject flexes the hip with the knee extended. Vastus medialis forms a rounded elevation both medial and superior to the patella, and vastus lateralis forms an elevation superolateral to the patella that is more proximal and less pronounced than that of vastus medialis (see <a href="#f0090">Fig. 76.20</a>).

Semitendinosus is the most lateral and posterior, while gracilis is the most medial and anterior; both tendons stand out sharply and can be seen when the knee is flexed against resistance and the hip adducted against resistance. The tendon of semimembranosus may be palpated deeply in the interval between the tendons of semitendinosus and gracilis: it is much thicker than the other two tendons and broadens rapidly as it is traced proximally.

The tendon of flexor hallucis longus lies inferior to, and grooves, the sustentaculum tali. As it passes towards the base of the distal phalanx of the great toe, it crosses the line of the flexor digitorum longus opposite the interval between the sustentaculum tali and the tuberosity of the navicular.

Common injection sites for the lower limb are around the hip for thigh and knee pain, and around the ankle for foot surgery. For the deeper nerves around the hip, ultrasound guidance enables the anaesthetist to secure an accurate needle position and to monitor the distribution of the local anaesthetic in real time (<a href="#bib83" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_83">Munirama and McLeod 2013</a>). For example, blockade of the sciatic nerve in the gluteal region, femoral nerve in the anterior thigh and obturator nerve in the medial thigh may be undertaken to provide pain relief following total knee replacement; the tibial nerve at the posteromedial ankle, the sural nerve at the posterolateral ankle and the superficial fibular nerves at the anterior ankle may all be anaesthetized at the ankle to allow ‘awake foot surgery’.</div></section><section><a id="s0435"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0350">Intramuscular injection</h4><div class="textfl" id="p5129">Intramuscular injections into the gluteal region using the classic dorsogluteal approach, with injections sited in the superior lateral quadrant, should be avoided to prevent iatrogenic damage to the sciatic nerve. Ventrogluteal approaches reduce the risk of iatrogenic neurovascular injury and are now recommended (<a href="#bib117" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Wallis et al 2018</a>). For this approach, the palm of the examiner’s hand, contralateral to the side being injected, is placed over the greater trochanter with the index finger pointing toward the anterior superior iliac spine and the remaining fingers abducted. The injection is made at the centre of the region bordered by the index finger, the iliac crest and the middle finger. Many so-called ‘intramuscular’ injections given into the gluteal region are actually given into the fat due to an insufficient needle length. Another safe alternative is to inject into the lateral aspect of the thigh (vastus lateralis).</div></section><section><a id="s0440"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0355">Joint injection and aspiration</h4><div class="textfl" id="p5130">Careful aseptic technique is essential for all joint aspirations and injections.</div><section><a id="s0445"/><section><a id="s0450"/><section><a id="s0455"/><section><a id="s0460"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0360">Hip</p><div class="textfl" id="p5131">Intra-articular hip injections are typically performed under fluoroscopic or ultrasonographic guidance.

A variety of entry portals have been described. The anterolateral portal is sited on the skin approximately 4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm lateral to the femoral artery pulse and 4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span> cm inferior to the inguinal ligament. Under fluoroscopy, a needle traversing the skin 30–45° proximally is advanced into the joint. Other more lateral portals can be used; the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve and the sciatic nerve are potentially at risk.</div></section><section><a id="s0515"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0390">Knee</p><div class="textfl" id="p5137">The knee is the joint most frequently examined arthroscopically. The standard portals are placed anteriorly. When the knee is flexed at a right-angle, ‘soft triangles’ bordered by the patellar ligament, the femoral condyles and the tibia and anterior horns of the menisci are palpable on either side of the superior third of the patellar ligament. Small incisions can be made in the apices of these triangular areas at about the level of the inferior pole of the patella for the anterolateral portal, and slightly lower for the anteromedial portal. These portals will allow passage of an arthroscope and instruments, with good access to most of the joint. The patellar ligament and the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve are at risk from the skin incisions. The nerve is less vulnerable than the ligament; its position is variable but it usually lies below the appropriate portal sites. In the days of open meniscal surgery, the nerve was usually divided and painful neuroma formation was not uncommon.</div><div class="text" id="p5138">Posteromedial and posterolateral portals are useful when better access to the posterior knee is required. The saphenous and common fibular nerves, respectively, are at risk with these approaches, and anatomical knowledge is vital to ensure safe portal placement. Laterally, the incision should be anterior to the tendon of biceps femoris, which can easily be palpated. Medially, the situation is more difficult because the saphenous nerve and long saphenous vein travel superficial to the medial epicondylar region of the knee, approximately a hand’s breadth posterior to the medial border of the patella. It is essential that sharp incision includes the skin only, and that dissection down to the joint capsule is undertaken bluntly. If the medial meniscus is sutured, the capsule must be exposed before tying off sutures to avoid ensnaring the nerve.</div></section><section><a id="s0520"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0395">Ankle</p><div class="textfl" id="p5139">The use of ankle arthroscopy is well established, especially in treating sports-related injuries. Anterior portals are standard. The anteromedial portal can be placed just medial to the tendon of tibialis anterior, in the palpable soft spot. However, this comes close to the long saphenous vein and saphenous nerve; limiting the sharp incision to the skin, followed by blunt deeper dissection, reduces the risk. Alternatively, the anteromedial portal can be chosen to pass between the lateral edge of tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus. The anterolateral portal is placed with the help of the arthroscope in the joint to check the position of a preliminary needle passed into it. The portal should pass lateral to fibularis tertius and extensor digitorum longus. The intermediate dorsal cutaneous branch of the superficial fibular nerve is at risk as it crosses the ankle anterior to the lateral malleolus, and therefore it is wise to mark the positions of the nerves and blood vessels with a pen before making any incision. The nerves can usually be felt at the front of the ankle, even in obese patients, and they are often seen if the ankle is pulled into maximal plantar flexion. Posterior ankle arthroscopy is controversial: there is a view that the proximity of the neurovascular bundle (medially) and the sural nerve (laterally) renders the procedure too hazardous. Keeping lateral to the tendon of flexor hallucis longus will safeguard the medial neurovascular bundle.</div></section></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0535"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0400">Placement of surgical incisions</h4><section><a id="s0540"/><section><a id="s0545"/><section><a id="s0550"/><section><a id="s0555"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0405">Hip</p><div class="textfl" id="p5140">Surgery of the hip joint is usually undertaken for congenital issues, slipped capital femoral epiphysis in children, trauma or arthroplasty. Anterior and anterolateral approaches, often used in children, put the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve at considerable risk. Even in more lateral approaches, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve and the femoral and sciatic nerves are all at risk through traction. A popular anterolateral approach to the hip joint involves splitting and separating forwards the anterior part of gluteus medius and vastus lateralis as a single sheet of tissue for subsequent reattachment to the greater trochanter. This technique relies on the anatomical continuity of the tissue. If the splitting of gluteus medius is more than a few centimetres superior to the tip of the greater trochanter, then the superior gluteal nerve and vessels are at risk, and weakness of hip abduction and a limp may result. In the posterior approach to the hip joint, gluteus maximus is incised in the line of its fibres. This is followed by division of the tendons of the short lateral rotators (piriformis, obturator internus and externus and the gemelli) near their trochanteric attachments to reveal the joint capsule. Reflecting these cut tendons medially protects the sciatic nerve. The inferior and superior gluteal nerves are at risk during posterior approaches to the hip.</div></section><section><a id="s0560"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0410">Knee</p><div class="textfl" id="p5141">Most open knee surgery can be undertaken through an anterior midline longitudinal incision, which gives good access and means that any future surgery can usually be undertaken via the same wound. New incisions run the risk of skin necrosis and poor wound healing as a consequence of interfering with the cutaneous blood supply. Inevitable interruption of cutaneous nerves, including the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve, means that there is always numbness lateral to a longitudinal incision.</div><div class="text" id="p5142">The extensile approach to the posterior knee is extensive. The key is to expose the sural nerve and short saphenous vein and to trace them proximally. This will lead the surgeon into the popliteal fossa and, after opening the deep fascia, safely to the neurovascular bundle. The wound crosses a flexure crease. A scar perpendicular to the crease might induce a fixed flexion contracture of the joint and therefore an S-shaped incision is employed where the transverse segment runs in the line of the flexure crease.</div></section><section><a id="s0565"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0415">Ankle and foot</p><div class="textfl" id="p5143">Incisions around the foot and ankle frequently put cutaneous nerves at risk and such an injury can result in a neuroma.
