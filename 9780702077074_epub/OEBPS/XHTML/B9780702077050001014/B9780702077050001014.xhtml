In this procedure, a contrast agent is instilled into a coronary artery via a catheter inserted into the opening (ostium) of that artery within an aortic sinus. The fluoroscopic images that are acquired have a high spatial and temporal resolution and are of benefit in patient diagnosis and treatment, but they are two-dimensional (2D). In marked contrast, computed tomography (CT) is a non-invasive imaging modality that can demonstrate the anatomy and relations of a region of interest in 3D.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">Despite the benefits afforded by CT, the cross-sectional imaging community used to regard the heart as an ‘object of mystery’ because of the rapidity of its movements and the limited speed of the available technology. Recent advances in the temporal resolution of CT scanners and associated radiation dose have enabled the development of computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA), which is able to capture motion-free, essentially ‘freeze-frame’, 3D images of the heart and coronary vasculature. Image quality can still be adversely affected by the presence of a tachycardia: in such cases image quality can be enhanced using a pharmacological intervention to reduce heart rate or by timing (gating) scans to end diastole or end systole, when the coronary arteries and associated cardiac structures show the least movement. The simplicity of image capture and quality improves as technology develops: the latest generation of CT scanners are now fast enough to acquire diagnostic images even in patients with tachycardia (<a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_1">Agliata et al 2019</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0020">After volumetric dataset acquisition using CTCA, post-processing with 3D reconstruction tools such as volume rendering and multiplanar reformatting enables visualization of the course, origin and anatomical relationships of the coronary arteries to neighbouring structures in a level of detail unmatched by other modalities. A relatively new post-processing technique, cinematic rendering, provides striking photorealistic images from CTCA datasets (<a href="#bib6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_6">Dappa et al 2016</a>). While standard volume rendering is able to demonstrate anatomy and anatomical relationships in three dimensions, the overall quality achieved with cinematic rendering is much higher (see <a href="../B9780702077050001026/B9780702077050001026.xhtml"><span class="bold">Commentary I.4</span></a> and <a href="#f0040">Fig. 7.2.7C–D</a> for a comparison of standard 3D volume rendering of the coronary arteries with cinematic rendering).</div><section><a id="s0010"/><section><a id="s0015"/><h2 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0010">Classification of coronary artery anomalies</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0025">While there is no universal definition for the division between coronary artery variants and anomalies, a simple, robust and commonly used threshold defines variants as differences occurring in &gt;1% of the population, and anomalies as differences occurring in ≤1% of the population (<a href="#bib2" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_2">Angelini 2002</a>, <a href="#bib4" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_4">2007</a>). Variants and anomalies may be asymptomatic and only of relevance during cardiac surgery or may cause chest pain, shortness of breath, or serious cardiovascular sequelae (<a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_10">Levin et al 1978</a>, <a href="#bib7" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_7">Frescura et al 1998</a>). Coronary artery anomalies can be grouped into three broad categories: anomaly of origin and course; anomaly of intrinsic anatomy (absence, atresia or duplication); and anomaly of termination. Some anomalies are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally, whereas others require treatment for symptomatic relief or to ensure continued cardiac function. CTCA is an important clinical tool for the diagnosis and detailed mapping of anomalies and the addition of photorealistic cinematic rendering further enhances its quality and utility for surgical and procedural planning and research, especially in cases of complex aberrant anatomy.</div><div class="text" id="p0030">An exhaustive list of all the documented coronary anomalies is not possible in a single article. The cases in this commentary demonstrate a mixture of both the most common and most serious anomalies and have been selected to highlight the sometimes extreme deviations from normal coronary artery anatomy that can occur.

The left coronary artery, anterior interventricular branch or circumflex branch of the left coronary artery, or the right coronary artery, can all arise from ectopic positions, which include a non-conventional aortic sinus, the ascending aorta, pulmonary trunk or other coronary arteries. The proximal part of an anomalous coronary artery follows one of five paths (pre-pulmonic, retro-aortic, inter-arterial, trans-septal or retro-cardiac) to access its more usual distal course and designated perfusion territory (<a href="#f0010">Fig. 7.2.1</a>). The pre-pulmonic and retro-aortic paths pass anterior to the pulmonary trunk and posterior to the ascending aorta, respectively, whereas the inter-arterial path passes between the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk. The trans-septal path is subpulmonic, traversing anteriorly and inferiorly through the myocardium of the interventricular septum; the retro-cardiac path passes around the heart within the atrioventricular (coronary) sulcus (<a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Kim et al 2006</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050001014/main.assets/f101-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 7.2.1</span> CTCA showing the five paths along which the proximal part of an anomalous coronary artery may travel.

Anomalous vessels taking the inter-arterial path are most frequently associated with sudden cardiac death, perhaps due to the exercise-related expansion of the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk and the consequent increase in angulation and decrease in luminal diameter of the anomalous vessel (<a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_3">Angelini et al 2006</a>) (<a href="#f0015">Fig. 7.2.2</a>).

The proximal part of the ectopic artery may follow one of the five paths previously described to reach its normal course and territory (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 7.2.1</a>). A single coronary artery may be associated with other congenital cardiac anomalies such as transposition of the great vessels, coronary artery fistulae, bicuspid aortic valve and the tetralogy of Fallot. The direction of blood flow in cases of a single coronary artery is normally anterograde or centrifugal (from larger central vessels to smaller peripheral vessels), whereas in left coronary artery atresia the direction of blood flow is partially retrograde or centripetal (from the smaller peripheral collateral vessels to one or more of the main left-sided arteries) (<a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_13">Musiani et al 1997</a>).

After birth, closure of the ductus arteriosus and a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance reduces pulmonary arterial pressure, which results in retrograde flow through the left coronary artery. Adequate perfusion of the territory of the left coronary artery becomes reliant on the development of a collateral circulation from the right coronary artery, which consequently dilates to accommodate the increased blood flow.

Coronary ostial atresia is often associated with ischaemic manifestations (<a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Musiani et al 1997</a>). When the left coronary artery is affected, right-to-left collateralization occurs during the later stages of development, and is often insufficient to meet the oxygen requirements of the left ventricular myocardium. Atresia of the ostium or proximal part of a coronary artery may be accompanied or replaced by a fibrous connection spanning the gap between the aortic sinus and a more distal functional part of the affected coronary artery. The fibrous connection can pull on its points of attachment causing a focal distortion that may be visible as a beak-like projection on imaging. Single coronary artery anomalies are not characterized by a focal distortion of adjacent vessel walls because their developmental origin is different and no such fibrous remnant exists.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0035"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050001014/main.assets/f101-06-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0035"/><a id="fspara0035"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 7.2.6</span> CTCA showing atresia of the ostium (opening) of the left coronary artery. <span class="bold">A</span>, Axial image at level of the aortic sinuses showing a normal right coronary artery origin (black arrow) and atresia of the left coronary artery origin with no visible connection between the left aortic sinus and the small anterior interventricular artery (white arrow). <span class="bold">B–D</span>, Cinematic rendered images. <span class="bold">B</span>, Anterior view showing a dilated conal branch of the right coronary artery (white arrow) connecting to, and supplying the territory of, the anterior interventricular branch of the left coronary artery (white arrowhead).
