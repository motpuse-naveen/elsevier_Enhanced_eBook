The elbow joint is formed from a complex hinge between the humerus and the ulna and a pivot joint between the humerus and the radial head. The elbow cannot be considered separately from the forearm joint as the two are inherently linked through the radial head. The forearm joint consists of a proximal pivot joint between the radial head and the radial notch of the ulna and distally between the head of the ulna and the ulna notch of the distal radius. There can be no movement at one joint without movement at the other because the whole forearm is a bicondylar joint with an intercondylar syndesmosis. The ligaments, tendons, muscles, nerves and vessels supplying and surrounding these joints are described in detail with key clinical relevance explained.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">anatomy; bones; elbow; forearm; joints; ligaments; muscles; nerves; tendons; vessels</div></section>--><section><section><a id="s0010"/><hgroup><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Skin and Soft Tissues</h2><h3 class="h2after1" id="cesectitle0025">Skin</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0030">Cutaneous vascular supply</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0015"/><section><a id="s0020"/><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The skin of the elbow and forearm receives its blood supply from muscle perforators, fasciocutaneous networks and direct cutaneous vessels. The skin of the anterolateral cubital fossa is supplied by muscle perforators arising from the radial collateral and radial recurrent arteries. The skin of the medial cubital fossa receives branches from an anastomosis between the inferior ulnar collateral and the ulnar recurrent arteries. Small direct cutaneous vessels spring from the brachial artery. The skin of the posterolateral aspect of the elbow is supplied by branches of the posterior interosseous recurrent artery and a rich plexus of collateral and anastomosing arteries. The skin of the posteromedial aspect is supplied by branches of the superior and inferior ulnar collateral arteries and the posterior ulnar recurrent artery feeding into the plexus.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">The skin of the anterior forearm is supplied by fasciocutaneous perforators; the largest is the inferior cubital artery, which arises from the radial artery at the distal apex of the cubital fossa and extends to midway down the forearm. Fasciocutaneous perforators from the radial artery supply the lateral two-thirds of the anterior surface of the forearm (see <a href="../B9780702077050000483/B9780702077050000483.xhtml#f0040">Fig. 48.5</a>). The vessels pass in the intermuscular septa between brachioradialis and flexor carpi radialis, and between flexor carpi radialis and flexor digitorum superficialis. Fasciocutaneous perforators from the ulnar artery supply skin over the ulnar side of the anterior forearm and the medial quarter of the posterior forearm from the cubital fossa to the wrist. A small contribution comes from musculocutaneous perforators that pass through brachioradialis and flexor carpi ulnaris.</div><div class="text" id="p0020">The skin of the distal third of the lateral forearm is supplied by the terminal perforating branches of the anterior interosseous artery. The central half of the posterior surface of the forearm, from the lateral edge of extensor digitorum, just below the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, to the wrist, is supplied by fasciocutaneous perforators from the posterior interosseous artery that pass along the intermuscular fascia between extensor carpi ulnaris and extensor digiti minimi.</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0035">Cutaneous innervation</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0025">A small area of skin anterolateral to the elbow is supplied by the lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm.

The lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm innervates the skin of the anterior half and radial posterior quarter of the forearm.

It is bounded proximally by the epicondylar line, medially by the lateral margin of pronator teres, and laterally by the medial face of brachioradialis; it is bisected by the tendon of biceps brachii. The deep fascia of the forearm forms its roof. It is continuous with the deep fascia of the anterior arm, attached to the medial and lateral humeral epicondyles and augmented by the bicipital aponeurosis, which sweeps across the medial and inferior part of the fossa to the fascia over the superficial flexor muscles. Supinator and brachialis lie in the floor of the fossa. From medial to lateral, the basilic, median cubital and cephalic veins lie in the superficial fascia. Branches of the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm are closely related to the basilic vein. The lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm runs down alongside the lateral edge of the tendon of biceps brachii. Deep to the deep fascia, and from medial to lateral, are the median nerve and the brachial artery, the latter inclining from the medial side of the arm to pass down the fossa close to the midline. The radial and ulnar arteries, with their accompanying veins, originate in the lower part of the fossa. The radial nerve enters the fossa laterally in the groove between brachioradialis and brachialis, and divides into the superficial radial and posterior interosseous nerves above the humero-radial joint. The superficial radial nerve continues down the forearm under cover of brachioradialis.</div></section><section><a id="s0040"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0050">Compartments of the forearm</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0035">The deep fascia, the interosseous membrane and the fibrous intermuscular septa, some of which pass between the deep fascia and bone, divide the forearm into compartments. These include the superficial and deep flexor (anterior) compartments, the extensor (posterior) compartment, and a proximolateral compartment that includes brachioradialis and extensors carpi radialis longus and brevis (the mobile wad) (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 50.2</span></a>). The dense sheath of the antebrachial fascia (the deep fascia of the forearm) is continuous above with the brachial fascia. It is attached to the olecranon, the posterior border of the ulna, and the lateral and medial epicondyles. The fascia is thicker posteriorly and in the lower forearm. It is strengthened above by tendinous fibres from biceps and triceps. Near the wrist, two localized thickenings, the flexor and extensor retinacula, retain the digital tendons in position (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513.xhtml#c0051">Ch. 51</a>). From its deep surface, septa pass between muscles, providing areas of additional attachment. Muscles arise from its inner aspect in the upper forearm. Vessels and nerves pass through apertures in the fascia; a large aperture anterior to the elbow transmits a venous communication between superficial and deep veins.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="931" id="pagebreak_931"/><a id="pg931"/></div><section><a id="sf0015"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000501/main.assets/f50-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 50.2</span> The compartments of the forearm.

It articulates with the discoid head of the radius, which lies in contact with its inferior surface in full extension of the elbow but slides on to its anterior surface during flexion. The groove of the trochlea winds backwards and laterally from the anterior to the posterior surface of the bone, and is wider, deeper and more symmetrical posteriorly. Anteriorly, the medial flange of the pulley is longer than the lateral, and the surface adjoining its projecting medial margin is convex to accommodate itself to the medial part of the upper surface of the coronoid process of the ulna. These asymmetries entail varying angulation between the humeral and ulnar axes, together with some conjunct rotation. The non-articular part of the condyle includes the medial and lateral epicondyles, and the olecranon, coronoid and radial fossae.</div></section><section><a id="s0065"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0070">Trochlea</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0050">The trochlea is a pulley-shaped surface that covers the anterior, inferior and posterior surfaces of the condyle of the humerus medially and articulates with the trochlear notch (greater sigmoid notch) of the ulna. On its lateral side, it is separated from the capitulum by a faint groove; its medial margin projects distally beyond the rest of the bone. When the elbow is extended, the inferior and posterior aspects of the trochlea are in contact with the ulna but, as the joint is flexed, the trochlear notch slides on to the anterior aspect so that its posterior aspect is then left uncovered (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">Giannicola et al 2015</a>). The downward projection of the medial edge of the trochlea is the principal factor in determining the degree of angulation between the long axis of the humerus and the long axis of the supinated forearm when the elbow is extended.</div></section><section><a id="s0070"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0075">Medial epicondyle</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0055">The medial border of the humerus ends by turning slightly backwards as the medial epicondyle, which forms a conspicuous, blunt projection on the medial side of the condyle. It is subcutaneous and usually visible, especially in passive flexion of the elbow. Its posterior surface is smooth and is crossed by the ulnar nerve, which lies in a shallow sulcus as it enters the forearm. The nerve can be felt and rolled against the bone here; if jarred against the epicondyle, a characteristic tingling sensation results. The lower part of the anterior surface of the medial epicondyle is marked by the attachment of the superficial group of forearm flexors: they arise from the epiphysis for the epicondyle but are entirely extracapsular. A capsular condensation, the ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow, is attached to the medial epicondyle medial to the attachments of these tendons.</div></section><section><a id="s0075"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0080">Lateral epicondyle</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0060">The lateral border of the humerus ends at the lateral epicondyle; its lower portion constitutes the lateral supracondylar ridge. The lateral <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="932" id="pagebreak_932"/><a id="pg932"/>epicondyle occupies the lateral part of the non-articular portion of the condyle but does not project beyond the lateral supracondylar ridge. It turns slightly forwards, unlike the medial epicondyle, which turns slightly backwards. Its lateral and anterior surfaces show a well-marked impression for the tendons of the superficial group of the extensor muscles of the forearm (see <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#f0060">Fig. 49.11A</a>), which arise from the lateral side of the lower humeral epiphysis; like the flexor tendons, they are extracapsular. The posterior surface, which is very slightly convex, is easily felt in a depression visible behind the extended elbow. A small area on the posterior surface gives origin to anconeus. A small tubercle is readily palpable on the lateral epicondyle. The lateral ligamentous complex, a capsular condensation attached to the lateral epicondyle, is immediately anterior and inferior to this tubercle, deep to the origins of the common tendon (see later).</div></section><section><a id="s0080"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0085">Olecranon, coronoid and radial fossae</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0065">The olecranon fossa is a deep hollow on the posterior surface of the condyle, immediately above the trochlea, that lodges the tip of the olecranon of the ulna when the elbow is extended. The floor of the fossa is always thin and may be partially deficient. A similar but smaller hollow, the coronoid fossa, lies immediately above the trochlea on the anterior surface of the condyle and accommodates the anterior margin of the coronoid process of the ulna during flexion of the elbow. A very slight depression, the radial fossa, lies above the capitulum on the lateral side of the coronoid fossa and is related to the margin of the head of the radius in full flexion of the elbow.</div></section><section><a id="s0085"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0090">Ossification</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0070">The distal humerus ossifies as follows. During the first year, ossification begins in the capitulum and extends medially to form the main part of the articular surface. The centre for the medial part of the trochlea appears in the ninth year in females and tenth year in males. Ossification begins in the medial epicondyle in the fourth year in females and the sixth in males, and in the lateral epicondyle in about the twelfth year. The centre for the medial epicondyle forms a separate epiphysis, which is entirely extracapsular, on the posteromedial aspect of the epicondyle. It is separated from the rest of the lower epiphysis by a downgrowth from the shaft, with which it becomes continuous at about the twentieth year. The centres for the lateral epicondyle, capitulum and trochlea coalesce around puberty, and the composite epiphysis consolidates with the shaft in the fourteenth year in females and sixteenth in males.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0090"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0095">Radius</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0075">The radius is the lateral bone of the forearm (<a href="#f0030"><span class="bold">Figs 50.5</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0040"><span class="bold">50.7</span></a>).

The rounded anterior border starts medial to the ulnar tuberosity, descends backwards, and is usually traceable to the base of the styloid process.

Distally, it is crossed obliquely by a rough, variable prominence, descending from the interosseous to the anterior border. The medial surface, between the anterior and posterior borders, is transversely convex and smooth. The posterior surface, between the posterior and interosseous borders, is divided into three areas. The most proximal is limited by a sometimes faint, oblique line that ascends laterally from the junction of the middle and upper thirds of the posterior border to the posterior end of the radial notch.

The articular surface is narrower than the base of the olecranon; non-articular areas are related to the synovial processes. The coronoid area of the trochlear notch is also divided; its medial and lateral areas correspond to the medial and intermediate areas of the olecranon.

The narrow strip between the interosseous border and vertical ridge gives rise to the attachment of three deep muscles: abductor pollicis longus arises from the proximal quarter, extensor pollicis longus from the succeeding quarter (sometimes a ridge is interposed between them), and extensor indicis from the third quarter.

The strongest and stiffest anterior band is attached by its apex to the anterior aspect of the medial epicondyle midway between the medial trochlea and the apex of the medial epicondyle and by its broader base to a proximal sublime tubercle on the medial margin of the coronoid. The anterior band is taut throughout most of the range of flexion and contributes to the stability of the joint. The posterior band of the ulnar collateral ligament is also triangular in shape; its apex is attached to the back of the medial epicondyle and its distal attachment is the medial margin of the olecranon. The posterior band becomes taut between 90° and full flexion of the elbow. Connecting these two thick bands is a less sturdy inferior oblique band that runs between the olecranon and coronoid processes, converting a depression on the medial margin of the trochlear notch into a foramen, through which the intracapsular fat pad is continuous with the extracapsular fat medial to the joint. The ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow lies beneath triceps, flexor carpi ulnaris, the ulnar nerve and the attachment of flexor digitorum superficialis as it extends from the medial epicondyle to the medial coronoid border.</div></section><section><a id="s0220"/><p class="h8hd" id="cesectitle0195">Radial collateral ligamentous complex</p><div class="textfl" id="p0245">The capsule on the lateral aspect of the elbow has interconnecting thickenings that form a broad sling between the humerus and ulna around the radial head.

The radial collateral ligament is attached low on the lateral epicondyle anterior and inferior to a small tubercle on the lateral epicondyle and inserts distally into the anular ligament which wraps around the radial head from the anterior rim of the radial notch of the ulna to the supinator crest. Proximally, the radial collateral ligament is continuous with the lateral ulnar collateral ligament that arises from the inferior aspect of the tubercle on the lateral epicondyle and inserts into the supinator crest and often gives rise to accessory fibres that cross the anular ligament distally. The posterolateral ligament is more proximal still and extends onto the posterior aspect of the capitulum, creating a hammock behind the radial head that limits dorsal translation (<a href="#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_8">Edwards et al 2018</a>).

The radius acts as a mobile strut within the forearm, such that rotation of the distal radius around the ulna carries the radiocarpal joint, wrist and hand into pronation or supination. The medial side of the head of the radius is longer than the lateral side; this eccentric morphology causes a cam effect during rotation of the proximal radio-ulnar joint. The radius is suspended by the interosseous membrane from the ulna, which is the fixed structure in the forearm.</div><div class="text" id="p0405">The interosseous membrane contributes to longitudinal stability by virtue of its oblique course from the radius proximally to the ulna distally. It appears to maintain the same tension throughout pronation and supination (<a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Ekenstam et al 1984</a>). If the membrane is disrupted, as in an Essex–Lopresti injury (fracture of the head of the radius, disruption of the interosseous membrane and dislocation of the distal radio-ulnar joint), the radius will migrate proximally; persistent radio-ulnar dissociation causes a complex instability of the forearm (<a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Hotchkiss et al 1989</a>). Correction of the fixed deformity of the forearm commonly seen in untreated cases of spastic cerebral palsy or birth lesions of the brachial plexus usually requires release of the membrane because it has become relatively shortened. Pronator quadratus and supinator protect the interosseous membrane, to some extent, during forced, rapid rotation of the forearm by ‘paying out’ eccentrically, thereby reducing the load applied across the membrane.</div><div class="text" id="p0410">The elbow is stabilized by the intrinsic shape of the joint and by its ligaments and muscles. The trochlear pulley is deeply seated within the trochlear notch, while the olecranon provides anteroposterior stability. Anterior stability in the sagittal plane is enhanced by the joint capsule, biceps, brachialis and the bicipital aponeurosis; posterior stability is enhanced by the triceps tendon and aponeurosis.</div><div class="text" id="p0415">The radial and ulnar collateral ligaments are key to stability in the coronal plane. Resistance to varus strain comes from the radial ligament complex, of which the posterior band is the most important. Resistance to valgus strain is provided by the ulnar collateral ligament complex, of which the anterior band is the most important. If the head of the radius is lost, an intact ulnar collateral ligament maintains stability of the elbow. If the ligament is disrupted, the ulna drifts into valgus, there is rotational instability and the trochlea is damaged. Stability of the radius is enhanced by anconeus and by the muscles arising from the lateral aspect of the distal humerus. Muscles that arise from the medial epicondyle contribute to stability of the ulna. Muscles that act across the elbow have a shunting effect, creating articular joint reaction compression forces that contribute to close-packing (the position of a joint in which the greatest stability is achieved for the least expended effort). The humero-ulnar joint is most closely packed and, therefore, most resistant to fatigue in flexion and supination.</div><section><a id="s0380"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0315">Flexion and extension</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0420">The elbow joint has relatively stable semi-congruent articular surfaces that are assisted by strong static and dynamic stabilizers, and which allow a flexion–extension arc of approximately 150°. When the elbow is extended and supinated, the forearm forms a ‘carrying angle’ with the humerus of approximately 17°; the absolute angle varies from individual to individual. It exists because the medial edge of the trochlear projects distally by 6<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm and because the superior articular surface of the coronoid is oblique. The carrying angle is not present in flexion when the humerus and ulna are in the same plane. With the arm adducted and the elbow flexed, the little finger meets the clavicle. If the humerus is rotated laterally, the little finger reaches the anterior shoulder. Pronation of the extended forearm masks the carrying angle by lining up the arm, forearm and hand.</div><section><a id="s1400"/><section><a id="s1405"/><section><a id="s1410"/><section><a id="s0400"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0320">Accessory movements</p><div class="textfl" id="p0430">The flexion–extension arc of the elbow is accompanied by some rotation; the ulna is slightly pronated in extension and supinated in flexion. In full extension, the radial head can be palpated posteriorly because the radial facet is larger than the capitulum. The excursion of the radial head in extension is limited by tension in the posterolateral ligament, by the muscles anterior to the joint and by the tip of the olecranon entering the olecranon fossa. In flexion, the rim of the radial head enters the radial fossa and the tip of the coronoid process enters the coronoid fossa.

The ulna rotates slightly at the elbow and allows a few degrees of abduction and adduction.

In pronation, the radius turns anteromedially and obliquely across the ulna. Its proximal end remains lateral to the ulna while its distal end lies medially and the interosseous membrane becomes spiralled. In supination, the radius returns to its former position lateral and parallel to the ulna and the interosseous membrane becomes unspiralled. The hand can be turned through 140–150° with the elbow extended; this can be increased to nearly 360° by humeral rotation and movements of the scapula. Power is greater in supination, a fact that has affected the design of nuts, bolts and screws, which are tightened by supination in the right-handed.</div><div class="text" id="p0455">Rotation of the forearm occurs between the head of the radius and the radial notch of the ulna proximally and the articulation of the head of the ulna and trochlear (sigmoid) notch. These proximal and distal radio-ulnar joints are pivot-type synovial joints; they act as a unit, permitting stable rotary motion (pronation 61–66°, supination 70–77°). During rotation, the distal radius moves around the head of the ulna. The axis for pronation and supination is often represented as a line through the centre of the radial head proximally and the ulnar attachment of the articular disc distally. This represents the axis of movement of the radius relative to the ulna but this does not remain stationary. The radial head rotates in the fibro-osseous ring; its distal lower end and articular disc swing round the head of the ulna. Rotation of the radial head occurs on the humeral capitulum. As the forearm moves from full pronation into supination, the ulna translocates medially by 9–10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm, so that the axis of rotation shifts but still passes through the head of the ulna. In addition, the trochlear notch changes its position of contact with the ulnar head, lying dorsal proximally in pronation and palmar distally in supination. The distal end of the ulna is not stationary during these movements; it moves along a curved course, posterolaterally in pronation and anteromedially in supination. The axis of movement, as defined above, is therefore displaced laterally in pronation and medially in supination. Hence, the axis for pronation and supination of the forearm and hand passes between the bones at both the proximal and distal radio-ulnar joints when ulnar movement is marked, but through the centres of the radial head and ulnar styloid when it is minimal. The axis may be extended along any digit, depending on whether the distal end of the ulna is medially or laterally displaced. The hand will rotate further than the forearm because of the sliding–rotatory movement that occurs between the carpal bones and the bases of the metacarpals, and, to a very minor degree, at the radiocarpal joint.</div></section><section><a id="s0410"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0330">Stability of the distal radio-ulnar joint</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0460">With the wrist in neutral extension and deviation, the main axis for transmission of force from the hand to the forearm passes through the head of the capitate, then through the scapholunate ligament and finally into the distal radius.

The close proximity of all the major nerve trunks to bone makes them vulnerable. The ulnar nerve is particularly at risk in elbow dislocation, especially when the medial epicondyle is displaced into the joint. All three nerves are at risk of displacement into a dislocated joint. The posterior interosseous and radial nerves are particularly at risk from a Monteggia fracture-dislocation. Any nerve may become entrapped within a fracture, e.g. the median nerve is often accompanied by the brachial artery in cases of supracondylar fracture. Pain that persists, or worsens, after reduction of a fracture suggests impending critical ischaemia, continuing irritation of the nerve, or both.

The interosseous membrane and the triangular fibrocartilage complex remain largely intact, which means that anatomical reduction of the ulnar fracture will usually restore congruity of the radiocapitellar and proximal radio-ulnar joints. The most common type of Monteggia fracture, type 1 (anterior dislocation), occurs when falling onto an outstretched arm hyperextends the elbow (<a href="#f0185"><span class="bold">Fig. 50.33</span></a>). The forearm is in neutral to mid-pronation, biceps brachii resists the hyperextension, the anular and quadrate ligaments rupture under the bending force, and the radial head dislocates. Compressive load then transfers to the ulnar diaphysis, which fails in tension in an oblique fracture. Type II (posterior dislocation) involves longitudinal force directed up the forearm with the elbow in a flexed position. The ulnar cortex fails first before rupture of the ulnar collateral ligament complex and posterior dislocation of the radial head. Four subtypes of this injury pattern have been identified, based on the location and force direction through the ulnar fracture (<a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Jupiter et al 1991</a>). Type III Monteggia injuries result in lateral or anterolateral dislocation of the radial head, associated with a metaphysial fracture of the proximal ulna. Type IV Monteggia injuries result in an anterior dislocation of the radial head and a fracture through the proximal third of both the radius and the ulna. The mechanism of injury is similar to that seen in type I injuries but the anteriorly directed force of the distal ulnar fragment, combined with the biceps resistance force, causes a fracture through the proximal radius. There is poor inter-observer agreement in classifiying these injuries. It is most useful to consider them as apex anterior ulna fracture with an intact dislocated radial head, or apex posterior ulna fracture with a fractured radial head.

The mechanism of posterior olecranon fracture dislocation is less certain; it occurs more commonly in osteopenic bone.</div><div id="p9470"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0195"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000501/main.assets/on50-07-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0195"/><a id="fspara0210"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 50.35</span> Elbow dislocation.</figcaption></figure></div></div></section></section></section></section></section><footer><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="954.e3" id="pagebreak_954.e3"/><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebib0010"/><h2 class="reftitle" id="s5010">References</h2><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebibsec0010"/><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib2"><!--<a hreef="#bib_2">2</a>. --><a id="ref0015"/><a href="#bib_2">Bednar</a> M.S, Arnoczky S.P, Weiland A.J. <cite>The microvasculature of the triangular fibrocartilage complex: its clinical significance</cite>. <cite><i>J Hand Surg [Am]</i></cite>. 1991;16:1101–1105.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib71"><!--<a hreef="#bib_71">71</a>. --><a id="ref0020"/><a href="#bib_71">Birch</a> R. <cite><i>Surgical Disorders of the Peripheral Nerves</i></cite>. 2nd ed. London: Springer-Verlag; 2011.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib4"><!--<a hreef="#bib_4">4</a>. --><a id="nspara1740"/><span class="italic">An account of the current state-of-the-art practice of diagnosis and management of surgical lesions of the peripheral nerves, including the brachial plexus.</span></p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib3"><!--<a hreef="#bib_3">3</a>. --><a id="ref0025"/><a href="#bib_3">Blakey</a> C.M, Biant L.C, Birch R. <cite>Ischaemia and the pink, pulseless hand complicating supracondylar fractures of the humerus in childhood: long-term follow-up</cite>. <cite><i>J Bone Joint Surg Br</i></cite>. 2009;91:1487–1492.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib5"><!--<a hreef="#bib_5">5</a>. --><a id="ref0030"/><a href="#bib_5">Camp</a> C.L, Jahandar H, Sinatro A.M, et al. <cite>Quantitative anatomic analysis of the medial ulnar collateral ligament complex of the elbow</cite>. <cite><i>Orthop J Sports Med</i></cite>. 2018;6 2325967118762751, top.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib6"><!--<a hreef="#bib_6">6</a>. --><a id="ref0035"/><a href="#bib_6">Chow</a> S.-P, Leung F. <cite>Radial and ulnar shaft fractures</cite>. In: <cite>Rockwood and Green’s Fractures in Adults</cite>. 7th ed. Bucholz R.W, Court-Brown C.M, Heckman J.D, et al., eds. 31. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins; 2010:881–904 Ch.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib7"><!--<a hreef="#bib_7">7</a>. --><a id="ref0040"/><a href="#bib_7">De</a> Kesel R, Van Glabbeek F, Mugenzi D, et al. <cite>Innervation of the elbow joint: Is total denervation possible?
