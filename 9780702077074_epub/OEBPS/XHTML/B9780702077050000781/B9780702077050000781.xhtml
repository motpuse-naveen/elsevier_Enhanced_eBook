Together they are successful at conducting such tasks as a result of their architecture and orientation of soft tissue structures providing kinaesthetic sense. The knee is the largest joint in the body and classified as a synovial modified hinge joint. It affords a relatively remarkable range of motion in flexion and extension with modest medial (internal) and lateral (external) rotation. Both anatomically and clinically, it consists of three distinct articulations, which generates risk of common pathologies. The arrangement of three compartments within the thigh and a contribution from the gluteal region laterally and leg inferiorly provides muscle–tendon complexes that act directly and indirectly on the knee joint, thus supporting propulsion. The osteology, neuromuscular orchestration and arrangement of intracapsular and extracapsular ligaments provide biomechanical support for the high demands of the knee and opportunities for augmentation if injured. The leg consists of two bones: the larger tibia, which transmits most of the stress of walking, while the smaller fibula provides secondary support and ankle stability. Muscles of different compartments of the leg primarily permit movement of the foot and toes: extensors in the anterior compartment are innervated by the deep fibular nerve and supplied vascularly by the anterior tibial artery; evertors in the lateral compartment are innervated by the superficial fibular nerve and supplied mostly by the anterior tibial artery; and flexors in the posterior compartment, which is divided into deep and superficial components, are innervated by the tibial nerve and supplied by the popliteal, posterior tibial and fibular arteries.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">ligaments; mobility; muscle–tendon complexes; neuromuscular; tibia; fibula</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The knee is the largest synovial joint in the body. It consists of three functional compartments that collectively form a dynamic, specialized hinge joint. During gait, the knee is able to withstand impressive weight-bearing loads while conducting precision movements, providing a stable yet fluid mechanism for relatively efficient bipedal locomotion. The complex arrangement of intra- and extracapsular ligaments that helps to counter the considerable biomechanical demands that are imposed on the joint can also be involved in disease (i.e. tri-compartment disease). The leg consists of two bones, with an interosseous membrane between them: the larger tibia, which transmits most of the stress of walking, and the smaller fibula, which provides secondary support and ankle stability.

The boundaries are biceps femoris proximolaterally; semimembranosus and the overlying semitendinosus proximomedially; the lateral head of gastrocnemius with the underlying plantaris distolaterally; and the medial head of gastrocnemius distomedially. The anterior boundary (or floor) of the fossa is formed, in proximodistal sequence, by the popliteal surface of the femur, the oblique popliteal ligament (overlying the posterior surface of the capsule of the knee joint), and the posterior aspect of the proximal tibia covered by popliteus and its fascia. The deep fascia (fascia musculorum) acts as the roof of the fossa and is continuous with the fascia lata proximally and with the deep fascia of the leg distally.

The tibial nerve descends centrally immediately anterior to the deep fascia, crossing the vessels posteriorly from lateral to medial. The common fibular nerve descends laterally immediately medial to the tendon of biceps femoris. When the popliteal vessels enter the proximal region of the popliteal fossa, they maintain a side-by-side relationship, which shifts to an over–under relationship as they descend through the fossa and are held together by <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1397" id="pagebreak_1397"/><a id="pg1397"/>dense areolar tissue within the fossa. This may potentially compromise the popliteal artery in distal femoral fractures. The popliteal vein is generally located posterior to the artery. Proximally, the vein lies lateral to the artery, crossing to its medial side distally. At times, the popliteal vein may be duplicated, so that the artery lies between the veins, which are usually bridged by connecting channels. An articular branch from the obturator nerve descends along the artery to the knee. Six or seven popliteal nodes are embedded in the fat, one under the deep fascia near the termination of the short saphenous vein, one between the popliteal artery and knee joint, and the others intimate with the popliteal vessels.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0025"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000781/main.assets/f78-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0025"/><a id="fspara0025"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 78.4</span> The left popliteal, posterior tibial and fibular arteries, posterior aspect. <br/><span class="figcredit">With permission from Waschke J, Paulsen F (eds) Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy, 15th ed.

Posteriorly, it covers the popliteal fossa as the popliteal fascia. It receives lateral expansions from the tendon of biceps femoris and multiple medial expansions from the tendons of sartorius, gracilis, semitendinosus and semimembranosus. The deep fascia blends with the periosteum on the subcutaneous surface of the tibia and the subcutaneous surfaces of the fibular head and lateral malleolus, and is continuous below with the extensor and flexor retinacula. It is thick and dense in the proximal and anterior part of the leg, where fibres of tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus are attached to its deep surface, and is thinner posteriorly, where it covers gastrocnemius and soleus.

Between these bony attachments, it is continuous with the fascia covering popliteus, which is, in effect, an expansion from the tendon of semimembranosus.

The anterior tibial artery passes forwards through a large oval opening near the proximal end of the membrane, and the perforating branch of the fibular artery pierces it distally. An associated ligament (ligament of Barkow), in the same plane as the interosseous membrane, may be found uniting the proximal tibiofibular joint; when present, it forms the upper half of this oval opening (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 78.5</a>) (<a href="../B9780702077050000781/B9780702077050000781_split_a.xhtml#bib56" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_56">Tubbs et al 2009</a>).

The three main compartments are anterior (extensor), lateral (fibular) and posterior (flexor) (<a href="#f0205"><span class="bold">Fig. 78.6</span></a>). The posterior compartment is divided into deep and superficial parts by the transverse intermuscular septum. These compartments are enclosed by the unyielding deep fascia and separated from each other by the bones of the leg and interosseous membrane, and by the anterior and posterior intermuscular septa that pass from the deep fascia to the fibula. The anterior compartment, the least expansile of the three, is bounded by the deep fascia, the interosseous surfaces of the tibia and fibula, the interosseous membrane and the anterior intermuscular septum. The lateral compartment lies between the anterior and posterior intermuscular septa, and is bordered laterally by the deep fascia and medially by the lateral surface of the fibula. The posterior compartment is bounded by the deep fascia, the posterior intermuscular septum, the fibula and tibia, and the interosseous membrane. Its relatively expansile superficial component is separated from the compacted deep component by the transverse intermuscular septum, reinforced by the deep aponeurosis of soleus.

In the elderly these soft tissues are often especially thin and unhealthy, reflecting the effects of ageing and venous stasis (see <a href="#pg1427">p. 1427</a>). Tibial fractures are common in the young and, partly as a result of poor soft tissue coverage, they are often open injuries. Diminished blood supply to the bone, caused by traumatic stripping of attached soft tissues, and the risk of contamination add greatly to the risk of non-union and infection of the fracture. Healing of fractures at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the tibia is compromised by the relatively poor blood supply to this region. Injury to the leg may result in elevated pressures of one or more compartments (so-called compartment syndrome); this clinical scenario is manifested by the ‘six Ps’: pain, paraesthesiae, pallor, paralysis, pulselessness and poikilothermia (differing temperatures in the affected and unaffected limbs).</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0095"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0105">Bones</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0110">The relevant bones are the femur (described in <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#c0077">Chapter 77</a>), tibia, fibula and patella.</div><section><a id="s0100"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0110">Tibia</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0115">The tibia lies medial to the fibula and is exceeded in length only by the femur (<a href="#f0035"><span class="bold">Figs 78.7</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0040"><span class="bold">78.8</span></a>).

The posterior surface is smooth except where it is crossed near its medial end by a nearly vertical but slightly oblique groove, which is usually conspicuous and extends to the posterior surface of the malleolus. The groove is adapted to the tendon of tibialis posterior, which usually separates the tendon of flexor digitorum longus from the bone. More laterally, the posterior tibial vessels, tibial nerve and flexor hallucis longus contact this surface. The lateral surface is the triangular fibular notch; its anterior and posterior edges project and converge proximally to the interosseous border. The floor of the notch is roughened proximally by a substantial interosseous ligament but is smooth distally and is sometimes covered by articular cartilage. The anterior and posterior tibiofibular ligaments are attached to the corresponding edges of the notch. The distal surface articulates with the talus and is wider in front, concave sagittally and slightly convex transversely, i.e. saddle-shaped. Medially, it continues into the malleolar articular surface, which may extend into the groove that separates it from the anterior surface of the shaft.

Ossification (<a href="#f0045"><span class="bold">Fig. 78.9</span></a>) begins in mid-shaft during stages 21–23 (50–58 days post fertilization). The proximal epiphysial centre is usually present at birth: at approximately 10 years, a thin anterior process from the centre descends to form the smooth part of the tibial tuberosity. A separate centre for the tuberosity may appear at about the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1401" id="pagebreak_1401"/><a id="pg1401"/>twelfth year and soon fuses with the epiphysis. Distal strata of the epiphysial plate are composed of dense collagenous tissue in which the fibres are aligned with the patellar ligament. Exaggerated traction stresses may account for Osgood–Schlatter disease, in which fragmentation of the epiphysis of the tibial tuberosity occurs during adolescence and produces a painful swelling around it. Healing occurs once the growth plate fuses, leaving a bony protrusion. Prolonged periods of traction with the knee extended, both in children and adolescents, can lead to growth arrest of the anterior part of the proximal epiphysis, which results in bowing of the proximal tibia as the posterior tibia continues to grow. The proximal epiphysis fuses in the sixteenth year in females and the eighteenth in males. The distal epiphysial centre appears early in the first year and joins the shaft at about the fifteenth year in females and the seventeenth in males. The medial malleolus is an extension from the distal epiphysis and starts to ossify in the seventh year; it may have its own separate ossification centre. An accessory ossification centre sometimes appears at the tip of the medial malleolus, more often in females than in males. It fuses during the eighth year in females and the ninth year in males; it should not be confused with an os subtibiale, which is a rare accessory bone found on the posterior aspect of the medial malleolus.

The anterior horn of the lateral meniscus is attached anterior to the intercondylar eminence, lateral to the anterior cruciate ligament. The eminence, with medial and lateral tubercles, is the narrow central part of the area. The raised tubercles are thought to provide a slight stabilizing influence on the femur. It is believed that the eminence becomes prominent once walking commences and that the tibial condyles transmit the weight of the body through the tibia.</div><a id="sf0075"/><div class="text" id="p0435">The posterior horn of the lateral meniscus is attached to the posterior slope of the intercondylar area. The posterior intercondylar area inclines down and backwards behind the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus. A depression behind the base of the medial intercondylar tubercle is for the attachment of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. The rest of the area is smooth and provides attachment for the posterior cruciate ligament, spreading back to a ridge to which the capsule is attached.</div></section><section><a id="s0455"/><p class="h8hd" id="cesectitle0340">Femoral surface</p><div class="textfl" id="p0440">The femoral condyles, bearing articular cartilage, are almost wholly convex. There are various opinions as to the contours of their sagittal profiles. One view is that they are spiral with a curvature increasing posteriorly (‘a closing helix’), that of the lateral condyle being greater. An alternative view is that the articular surface for contact with the tibia on the medial femoral condyle describes the arcs of two circles. According to this view, the anterior arc makes contact with the tibia near extension and is part of a virtual circle of larger radius than the more posterior arc, which makes contact during flexion. The lateral femoral condyle is believed to describe a single arc and thus to possess a single radius of curvature.</div><div class="text" id="p0445">Tibiofemoral congruence is improved by the menisci, which are shaped to produce concavity of the surfaces presented to the femur; the combined lateral tibiomeniscal surface is deeper. The lateral femoral condyle has a faint groove anteriorly, which rests on the peripheral edge of the lateral meniscus in full extension. A similar groove appears on the medial condyle but does not reach its lateral border, where a narrow strip contacts the medial patellar articular surface in full flexion. These grooves demarcate the femoral patellar and condylar surfaces. The differences between the shapes of the articulating surfaces correlate with the movements of the knee joint.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0460"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0345">Menisci</p><div class="textfl" id="p0450">The menisci (semilunar cartilages) are crescentic, intracapsular, fibrocartilaginous laminae (see <a href="#f0070">Fig. 78.14</a>; <a href="#f0075"><span class="bold">Fig. 78.15</span></a>). They serve to widen, deepen and prepare the tibial articular surfaces that receive the femoral condyles. Their peripheral attached borders are thick and convex, and their free, inner borders are thin and concave. Their peripheries are vascularized by capillary loops from the fibrous capsule and synovial membrane, while their inner regions are less vascular. Tears of the menisci are common.

The inner two-thirds of each meniscus consist of radially organized collagen bundles, and the peripheral one-third consists of larger circumferentially arranged bundles (<a href="../B9780702077050000781/B9780702077050000781_split_a.xhtml#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Ghadially et al 1983</a>). Thinner collagen bundles parallel to the surface line the articular surfaces of the inner part, while the outer portion is covered by synovium. This structural arrangement suggests specific biomechanical functions for the two regions: the inner portion of the meniscus is suited to resisting compressive forces while the periphery is capable of resisting tensional forces. With ageing and degeneration, compositional changes occur within the menisci, which reduce their ability to resist tensional forces. Outward displacement of the menisci by the femoral condyles is resisted by firm anchorage of the peripheral circumferential fibres to the intercondylar bone at the meniscal horns.</div><div class="text" id="p0460">Alternatively, each meniscus can be considered as consisting of three contiguous segments, namely an anterior horn/root, a body, and a posterior horn/root. The anterior roots of both menisci have relatively simple, planar insertions into the tibial plateau, while the posterior roots reveal complex, three-dimensional insertions into the tibial plateau.</div><div class="text" id="p0465">The menisci spread load by increasing the congruity of the articulation, provide stability by their physical presence and proprioceptive feedback, and may cushion the underlying bone from the considerable forces generated during extremes of flexion and extension of the knee. They play a vital role in protecting against osteochondral damage of the tibiofemoral joint with specific importance afforded to the meniscal root. The loss of attachment at the root of the meniscus impairs the ability to maintain hoop strain when loading the tibiofemoral joint. (Hoop strain refers to the circumferential nature of the stress on meniscal fibres during axial loading.) This decrease in hoop strain resistance is responsible for increased articular cartilage contact pressure, which can lead to rapid degenerative changes (<a href="../B9780702077050000781/B9780702077050000781_split_a.xhtml#bib32" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_32">Krych et al 2017</a>).

Near its posterior attachment, it commonly sends a posterior meniscofemoral ligament superomedially behind the posterior cruciate ligament to the medial femoral condyle. An anterior meniscofemoral ligament may also connect the posterior horn to the medial femoral condyle anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament. The meniscofemoral ligaments are often the sole attachments of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus. More laterally, part of the tendon of popliteus is attached to the lateral meniscus, and so mobility of its posterior horn may be controlled by the meniscofemoral ligaments and by popliteus. A meniscofibular ligament occurs in most knee joints. As with the medial meniscus, there is a tibial attachment via the so-called coronary ligament, but the meniscus has no peripheral bony attachment in the region of popliteus; in the surgical literature, this gap is referred to as the popliteus hiatus.</div></section><section><a id="s5051"/><p class="h8hd" id="cesectitle0360">Discoid lateral meniscus</p><div class="textfl" id="p0500">A discoid lateral meniscus occasionally occurs, often bilaterally. The distinguishing features of a discoid lateral meniscus are its shape and posterior ligamentous attachments. The following classification of the abnormality is based on the work of <a href="../B9780702077050000781/B9780702077050000781_split_a.xhtml#bib62" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_62">Watanabe et al (1979)</a>. In its mildest form, the partial discoid meniscus is simply a wider form of the normal lateral meniscus. The acute, medial free edge is interposed between the femoral and tibial condyles but it does not completely cover the tibial plateau. A complete discoid meniscus appears as a biconcave disc with a rolled medial edge and covers the lateral tibial plateau. The Wrisberg type of meniscus has the same shape as a complete discoid meniscus but its only peripheral posterior attachment is by the meniscofemoral ligaments. In this case, the normal tibial attachment of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus is lacking but the posterior meniscofemoral ligament persists. As a result, this type of meniscus is attached anteriorly to the tibia and posteriorly to the femur, which renders the posterior horn unstable. Under these circumstances, the meniscus is liable to become caught between the femur and tibia: this accounts for the classic presenting symptom of the ‘clunking knee’ in some patients. The aetiology of discoid meniscus is not clear. Most are asymptomatic and are often found by chance at arthroscopy. However, they may cause difficulty in gaining access to the lateral compartment at arthroscopy. A discoid medial meniscus is extremely rare.</div></section><section><a id="s0480"/><p class="h8hd" id="cesectitle0365">Transverse ligament of the knee</p><div class="textfl" id="p0505">The transverse ligament of the knee connects the anterior convex margin of the lateral meniscus to the anterior horn of the medial meniscus (see <a href="#f0070">Figs 78.14</a>, <a href="#f0110">78.22</a>).

It forms a large suprapatellar bursa between quadriceps femoris and the lower femoral shaft proximal to the superior patellar border (<a href="#f0115"><span class="bold">Figs 78.23</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0120"><span class="bold">78.24</span></a>). The bursa is an extension of the joint cavity. The attachment of articularis genus to its proximal aspect prevents the bursa from collapsing into the joint. Alongside the patella, the membrane extends beneath the aponeuroses of the vasti, especially under vastus medialis. It extends proximally a hand’s breadth above the superior pole of the patella. Distal to the patella, the synovial membrane is separated from the patellar ligament by an infrapatellar fat pad. Where it lies beneath the fat pad, the membrane projects into the joint as two fringes, alar folds, which bear villi. The folds converge posteriorly to form a single infrapatellar fold or plica (ligamentum mucosum), which curves posteriorly to its attachment in the femoral intercondylar fossa (<a href="#f0125"><span class="bold">Fig. 78.25</span></a>).

Anteriorly, there is a large subcutaneous prepatellar bursa between the lower half of the patella and skin; a small, deep infrapatellar bursa between the tibia and patellar ligament; a subcutaneous infrapatellar bursa between the distal part of the tibial tuberosity and skin; and a large suprapatellar bursa, which is the superior extension of the knee joint cavity (see <a href="#f0120">Fig. 78.24</a>). Posterolaterally, there are bursae between the lateral head of gastrocnemius (lateral subtendinous bursa of gastrocnemius) and the joint capsule (this bursa is sometimes continuous with the joint cavity); the fibular collateral ligament and the tendon of biceps femoris; the fibular collateral ligament and the tendon of popliteus; and the tendon of popliteus and the lateral femoral condyle, which is usually an extension of the synovial cavity of the joint. The last two bursae may communicate with each other.</div><div class="text" id="p0650">Medially, the arrangement of the bursae is complex. The bursa between the medial head of gastrocnemius and the fibrous capsule is prolonged between the medial tendon of gastrocnemius and the tendon of semimembranosus (the semimembranosus bursa), and usually communicates with the joint. The bursa between the tendon of semimembranosus and the medial tibial condyle and the medial head of gastrocnemius may communicate with this bursa. The anserine bursa is located between the tibial collateral ligament and the tendons of sartorius, gracilis and semitendinosus. Bursae that vary in both number and position lie deep to the tibial collateral ligament between the joint capsule, femur, medial meniscus, tibia or tendon of semimembranosus. Occasionally, there may be a bursa between the tendons of semimembranosus and semitendinosus. Posteriorly, bursae associated with the knee are variable.</div><div class="text" id="p0655">The clinically important bursae are the anterior group, the anserine bursa and the semimembranosus bursa. Inflammation of the subcutaneous prepatellar bursa and infrapatellar bursa are referred to colloquially as ‘housemaid’s knee’ and ‘clergyman’s knee’, respectively. The anserine bursa can become inflamed, especially in athletes. In adults, bursal inflammation producing a popliteal fossa swelling commonly occurs secondary to degeneration within the knee joint; regardless of its size and position, it almost always arises from the plane between semimembranosus and the tendon of the medial head of gastrocnemius.</div></section><section><a id="s0595"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0445">Relations and ‘at risk’ structures</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0660">The tendon of quadriceps femoris (which encloses and is attached to the non-articular surfaces of the patella), the patellar ligament, tendinous expansions from vasti medialis and lateralis (which extend over the anteromedial and anterolateral aspects of the capsule, respectively), and the patellar retinacula all lie anterior to the knee joint. Posteromedially are sartorius and the tendon of gracilis (which lies along its posterior border); both descend across the joint. Posterolaterally the tendon of biceps femoris and the common fibular nerve (which lies medial to the tendon) are in contact with the capsule, and thereby separated from the tendon of popliteus. Posteriorly the popliteal artery and associated lymph nodes lie posterior to the oblique popliteal ligament; the popliteal vein is posteromedial or medial, and the tibial nerve is posterior to both. The nerve and vessels are overlapped by both heads of gastrocnemius and laterally by plantaris. Gastrocnemius contacts the capsules on either side of the vessels. Semimembranosus lies between the capsule and semitendinosus, medial to the medial head of gastrocnemius.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0660"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0500">Biomechanics of the Knee</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0745">The knee joint is a complex synovial joint consisting of the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral articulations. It functions to control the centre of body mass and posture in the activities of daily living. This necessitates a large range of movement in three dimensions coupled with the ability to withstand high forces. These conflicting parameters of mobility and stability are only achieved by the interactions between the articular surfaces, the passive stabilizers and the muscles that cross the joint.</div><div class="text" id="p0750">The relatively incongruent nature of the joint surfaces makes the knee joint inherently mobile. In addition, because it acts as a pivot between the longest bones in the body, and is subjected to considerable loads in locomotion, the joint is also potentially at risk of injury if any of the multiple factors providing joint stability are compromised. The long bones may act as levers, increasing the stresses on the stabilizing ligaments.</div><section><a id="s0600"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0450">Movements</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0665">Movements at the knee are customarily described as flexion, extension, medial (internal) and lateral (external) rotation. Flexion and extension differ from true hingeing, in that the articular surface profiles of the femoral and tibial articular surfaces produce a variably placed axis of rotation during the flexion arc, and when the foot is fixed, flexion entails corresponding conjunct (coupled) lateral rotation. These conjunct rotations are a product of the complex geometry of the articular surfaces and, to an extent, the disposition of the associated ligaments. There is differential motion in the medial and lateral tibiofemoral compartments. Laterally, there is considerable displacement of the femur on the tibia, with rolling as well as sliding at the joint surface. In contrast, medially, for most of the flexion arc there is minimal relative motion of the femur and tibia, and the motion almost exclusively involves one joint surface sliding on the other. In full flexion, the lateral femoral condyle is close to posterior subluxation off the lateral tibial articular surface. Medially, significant posterior femoral displacement only occurs when flexion exceeds 120°. The menisci move with the femoral condyles, the anterior horns more than the posterior, and the lateral meniscus considerably more than the medial.</div><div class="text" id="p0670">The axial rotations have a smaller range than the arc of flexion and extension. These rotations are conjunct, and integral with flexion and extension, i.e. they are obligatory. They can also be adjunct and independent, i.e. voluntary, and are best demonstrated with the knee semi-flexed. The degree of axial rotation therefore varies with flexion and extension.</div><div class="text" id="p0675">The range of extension is 5–10° beyond the ‘straight position’. Active flexion is approximately 120° with the hip extended, 140° when it is flexed, and 160° when aided by a passive element, e.g. sitting on the heels. Voluntary rotation is 60–70° but conjunct rotation only 20°.</div><div class="text" id="p0680">Conjunct medial rotation of the femur on the tibia in the later stages of extension is part of a ‘locking’ mechanism, the so-called ‘screw-home movement’, which is an asset when the fully extended knees are subjected to strain. Full extension results in the close-packed position, with maximal spiralization and tightening of the ligaments. The roles of the articular surfaces, musculature and ligaments in generating conjunct rotations remain controversial (<a href="../B9780702077050000781/B9780702077050000781_split_a.xhtml#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Girgis et al 1975</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000781/B9780702077050000781_split_a.xhtml#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_44">Rajendran 1985</a>) but the following points can be made. The lateral combined meniscotibial ‘receiving surface’ is smaller, more circular and more deeply concave. Since the articular surface is virtually convex in sagittal section, the depth of the receiving surface is largely due to the presence of the lateral meniscus. The lateral femoral articular surface is also smaller. Consequently, the lateral femoral condyle approaches full congruence with the opposed surface some 30° before full extension (well before the medial condyle). Simple extension cannot continue, but medial rotation of the femur occurs on a vertical axis through its head and medial condyle; the medial femoral condyle moves very little in the sagittal plane and is stabilized by the ‘upslope’ of the anterior half of the medial tibia, while rotation of the lateral femoral condyle and meniscus brings the anterior horn of the latter on to the anterior ‘downslope’ of the lateral tibial condyle. Rotation and extension follow simultaneously and smoothly until final close packing of both condyles is accomplished. At the beginning of flexion from full extension (with the foot fixed), lateral femoral rotation occurs, which ‘unlocks’ the joint. While joint surfaces and many ligaments are involved, electromyographic evidence reveals that contraction of popliteus is important, and that it pulls down and backwards on the lateral femoral condyle, lateral to the axis of femoral rotation.

During extension, the patellar ligament is tightened by quadriceps femoris but is relaxed in the erect attitude. When the knee flexes, the fibular collateral ligament and the posterior part of the tibial collateral ligament relax but the cruciate ligaments and the anterior part of the tibial collateral ligament remain taut; the posterior parts of the menisci are compressed between the femoral and tibial condyles. Flexion is checked by quadriceps femoris, anterior parts of the knee joint capsule, posterior cruciate ligament and compression of soft tissues behind the knee. In extreme passive flexion, contact of the calf with the thigh may be the limiting factor and parts of both cruciate ligaments are also taut.

The static bony factors that counter this tendency to move laterally are the congruity of the patellofemoral joint and the buttressing effect of the larger lateral part of the patellar surface of the femur, which, clinically, is often referred to as the trochlear groove. Instability of the patella may result if the patella is small or if the patellar surface of the femur is too shallow. The static ligamentous factors are the medial patellofemoral ligament and medial patellar retinaculum.</div><div class="text" id="p0730">Dynamic neuromuscular control is important. The most distal part of vastus medialis (vastus medialis obliquus) consists of transverse fibres that are attached directly to the medial edge of the patella: these pull the patella medially, countering the tendency to move laterally. This is the muscle that is preferentially strengthened in a physical therapy programme aimed at treating patellofemoral conditions often associated with patella tracking problems such as those seen in growing adolescents.</div></section><section><a id="s0650"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0490">Tibiofemoral joint</p><div class="textfl" id="p0735">The tibiofemoral joint surfaces are inherently mobile, especially laterally. Medially, some stability is afforded by the relatively concave tibial surface and the relatively fixed posterior horn of the medial meniscus. Both medially and laterally the menisci are helpful, particularly as they move with the femoral condyles. Ligaments play a major role in constraining mobility because they bind the bones in positions of extreme stress and also provide proprioceptive feedback, aiding coordination of stabilizing muscle activity. To take a somewhat ‘two-dimensional’ view, the tibial and fibular collateral ligaments may be considered as sensors (resistors) of valgus and varus forces on the knee, respectively, and the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments as sensors (resistors) of anterior and posterior tibial translation, respectively. However, in reality the situation is more complex than this. The stresses are rarely applied in orthogonal planes and so a combination of forces, especially rotational, is involved. Moreover, many structures other than the collateral and cruciate ligaments are involved in stabilizing the joint. The ‘posterolateral corner’, which is the primary restraint to varus and rotational forces of the tibia, consists of the popliteofibular, fabellofibular, arcuate and fibular collateral ligaments and iliotibial tract, together with popliteus, the lateral head of gastrocnemius and biceps femoris (see <a href="#f0105">Fig. 78.21</a>). The ‘posteromedial corner’, which resists tibial rotation, consists of the posterior oblique portion of the superficial part of the tibial collateral ligament, and the capsule including the oblique popliteal ligament and semimembranosus (see <a href="#f0085">Fig. 78.17</a>). Since stresses are often a combination of force plus rotation, structures usually operate together rather than in isolation.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0655"/><p class="h6hd" id="cesectitle0495">Loading at the knee</p><div class="textfl" id="p0740">During level walking, the force across the tibiofemoral joint for most of the cycle is between two and four times body weight, and can be more. In contrast, the force across the patellofemoral joint is no more than 50% of body weight. Peak force transmission across the joint increases sequentially as the menisci, articular cartilage and subchondral bone are damaged or removed. Walking up or down stairs has little influence on tibiofemoral forces, but significantly increases patellofemoral forces to two (walking up) or three (walking down) times body weight, reflecting the changed angle of the tendon of quadriceps femoris and patellar ligament during flexion. There are two mechanisms for ameliorating forces transmitted across the patella: the extensor lever arm is lengthened as the axis of rotation moves posteriorly during flexion, and the contact area between the patella and femur almost triples between 30° and 90°. To cope with the potential large forces generated by activities such as running, the patella has the thickest articular cartilage in the body.</div></section></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0665"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0505">Knee joint kinematics</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0755">The surfaces of the tibia and femur are not as conforming as those of the relatively congruent hip joint. Although this variation in geometry permits motion to occur in six degrees of freedom (<a href="#f0130"><span class="bold">Fig. 78.26</span></a>), the primary motion of the knee occurs in the sagittal plane, and a relatively minor degree of movement occurs in the transverse plane. The knee joint may therefore be described simplistically as a modified hinge joint allowing flexion–extension and a measure of rotatory motion. Knee motion is normally defined as starting from 0° (the neutral position), when the tibia and femur are in line in the sagittal plane. Biomechanically, it is important that the knee reaches the neutral position in extension because that allows the leg to support the body weight like a simple strut when the subject is standing still. When the subject is standing upright, if the knee is flexed, the vertical line of action of the body weight passes posterior to the centre of rotation of the knee, tending to cause the body to tilt posteriorly. To counterbalance this, continuous quadriceps femoris contraction is required, causing expenditure of energy.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0130"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000781/main.assets/f78-26-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0130"/><a id="fspara0130"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 78.26</span> The knee joint motion in three dimensions, described using six independent variables (degrees of freedom).</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0760">Active knee flexion leads to approximately 130° flexion. The active motion is limited by apposition of the soft tissue masses (posterior thigh and calf). Passive flexion may reach 160°. This is required in people who habitually kneel as part of daily life, and is a challenge for designers of knee prostheses. It can be observed that such deep flexion is often accompanied by tibial medial rotation, so that, when the subject is kneeling, the buttocks can rest on the feet. This movement carries the lateral tibial plateau anteriorly, so that it does not engage with the femoral lateral condyle in deep knee flexion. The femoral <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1413" id="pagebreak_1413"/><a id="pg1413"/>condyle passes posteriorly and rides over the horn of the lateral meniscus.</div><div class="text" id="p0765">The most frequently employed knee movement occurs when walking (<a href="#f0135"><span class="bold">Fig. 78.27</span></a>). When the leg is swinging past the supporting leg, the knee must be flexed in order to avoid dragging the toes on the ground; this requires approximately 65° knee flexion. When the swinging leg approaches the first contact with the ground, the knee extends, to move the foot forwards for heel contact. If the knee remained extended, this would then cause the body to move in a circular arc, centred at the ankle, causing the centre of gravity to move upwards and then back down again, leading to more energy expenditure. It would also increase the forces on the knee because the leg would act more like a rigid strut, unable to dissipate the impact forces when the foot hit the ground. All these problems are overcome by flexing the knee 15° in the mid-stance phase (see <a href="#f0135">Fig. 78.27</a>); the centre of gravity of the body can move forwards at approximately constant height, and the impact energy is absorbed by stretching quadriceps femoris.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0135"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000781/main.assets/f78-27-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0135"/><a id="fspara0135"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 78.27</span> Knee flexion–extension motion during gait.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0770">Tibial medial–lateral rotation also occurs during gait: the tibia rotates laterally during terminal extension, a phenomenon known as ‘screw-home’. It is surmised that this rotation helps to lock the geometry and tighten the soft tissues, thereby maintaining the knee in a stable position prior to the impact load of weight-bearing. The knee acts as one link in a chain of limb segments, and this screw-home relates to rotation of both the foot and hip. When the foot is swung forwards for heel contact, the pelvis rotates so that the hip is moved forwards, a movement that entails lateral rotation of the hip. During stance, the femur is medially rotated against the locked knee. Tibial lateral rotation also causes inversion of the foot at the subtalar joint, raising the arch and locking the structure of the foot. The knee flexion that occurs after the impact on the ground allows the tibia to rotate medially so that the foot everts, softening its structure and allowing it to deform and absorb energy. Conversely, towards toe-off, the knee extends, rotating the tibia laterally, so the foot is again a rigid lever with which to push the body forwards.</div><section><a id="s0670"/><section><a id="s0675"/><h4 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0510">Articular kinematics</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0775">Consideration of knee motion at a smaller scale, i.e. within the joint, is difficult to separate from the actions of the ligaments that act as passive restraints to tibiofemoral joint movements, and are discussed below.</div><div class="text" id="p0780">Sagittal sections of the knee reveal that the arcs of the femoral condyles are much longer than the anterior–posterior length of the tibial plateau. This means that if the knee flexed with a purely rolling motion, then the femur would roll off the back of the tibia long before the knee reaches full flexion (<a href="#f0140">Fig. 78.28</a>). This does not happen because the femur slides anteriorly at the same time as it rolls posteriorly, and thus remains in correct articulation. If the knee were to possess a fully conforming roller-in-trough geometry, as in the humero-ulnar joint, then flexion would occur by pure sliding movement between the joint surfaces. This conformity is not possible at the knee because it would inhibit the tibial medial–lateral rotation that is needed during locomotion.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0140"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000781/main.assets/f78-28-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0140"/><a id="fspara0140"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 78.28</span> Knee joint kinematics during gait: rolling and sliding (flexion, anterior translation).</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0785">In the locked, fully extended knee, the anterodistal femoral articular surfaces press on to the anterior horns of the menisci. This tends to cause the femur to slide posteriorly, tensing the anterior cruciate ligament and slackening the posterior cruciate ligament. With knee flexion, the femur lifts off the anterior horns of the menisci, leading to contact between the smaller radii of the posterior parts of the femoral condyles and the tibial plateau plus the posterior horns of the menisci. This means that the centre of contact moves posteriorly in early knee flexion. After this, the femoral condyles have approximately circular sagittal sections. The femur is now prevented from rolling back any further by tension in the anterior cruciate ligament.</div></section><section><a id="s0680"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0515">Articular mechanics</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0790">The combined effect of the external and internal loads on the knee is to impose considerable forces on the articular cartilage.

The contact pressure is, therefore, dependent on the area of contact as well as the load itself. Fully conforming articular surface geometry would allow the greatest area of contact, and thus would minimize contact pressure; however, this is not present in the knee. The medial compartment of the knee is semi-conforming with a convex femoral condyle articulating over a concave medial tibial plateau. The lateral compartment has less conformity; the lateral tibial plateau is flat or slightly convex in sagittal sections. These different shapes reflect the differential movement of the medial and lateral compartments. In normal movement, the screw-home rotation of the tibia occurs about a medial axis, which means that most of the rotation of the tibia is due to an anterior–posterior translation of the lateral compartment (<a href="#f0145"><span class="bold">Fig. 78.29</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0145"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000781/main.assets/f78-29-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0145"/><a id="fspara0145"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 78.29</span> The shape of the articular surfaces providing mobility of the lateral compartment.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0800">In order to maintain some degree of conformity, and also to minimize contact pressure between the femur and tibia, the menisci are wedge-shaped in cross-section, thereby increasing the area over which the compressive force on the knee is distributed.

However, as the knee flexes, the smaller radii of the posterior parts of the femoral condyles cause the femur to lift off the anterior horns of the menisci, and the femoral contact is now solely on the posterior horns in the flexed knee.

When the femoral condyle presses down on the meniscus, it tends to squeeze the meniscus out of the joint because of its tapered cross-section. This causes the diameter of the circular shape of the meniscus (and therefore the meniscal circumference) to increase. This is resisted by ‘hoop tension’ in strong fibres that pass around the periphery of the meniscus, and transmit the tension to the tibial plateau via strong insertional ligaments. As the tissue is adapted to resist hoop stresses, it has much greater hoop strength (approximately 100<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>MPa) than radial strength (approximately 3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>MPa), which explains why bucket handle tears occur.

A variety of lubrication mechanisms normally prevent joint surface damage. Thus, in the swing phase, when the foot is off the ground, the joint surfaces are loaded lightly, and have high relative velocity while the knee flexes and extends. This allows the synovial fluid to separate the surfaces, giving fluid film lubrication, with very low friction and no wear (<a href="#f0160"><span class="bold">Fig. 78.32</span></a>). At the time of heel contact, a large impact load acts to compress the surfaces together. At a microscopic level, the surfaces do not come into contact because of the squeeze-film effect: in essence, the impact occurs so rapidly (less than 0.1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>sec) that the synovial fluid cannot all be squeezed out of the joint space because of its viscosity and the narrowness of the space. In the mid-stance phase, the flexion–extension motion again entrains the synovial fluid in between the joint surfaces, producing what is known as a hydrodynamic effect: the fluid is trapped between the surfaces by the motion and therefore it acts to separate them. Finally, when the foot is pushing off the body weight, there is little motion and the thin fluid film diminishes under the compressive load. If the squeeze-film effect were insufficient, then the joint surfaces would come into direct contact were it not for the fact that the synovial fluid contains large protein molecules that are trapped on the cartilage surfaces when the fluid is expelled.

It is invested on its deep surface by synovial membrane, and grooves the posterior border of the lateral meniscus and the adjoining part of the tibia before it emerges inferior to the posterior band of the arcuate ligament.

It is usually regarded as the muscle that ‘unlocks’ the joint at the beginning of flexion of the fully extended knee; electromyography supports this view. Its connection with the arcuate popliteal ligament, fibrous capsule and lateral meniscus has led to the suggestion that popliteus may retract the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus during lateral rotation of the femur and flexion of the knee joint, thus protecting the meniscus from being crushed between the femur and the tibia during these movements. The muscle is markedly active in crouching, perhaps to provide stability as the tibia rotates medially during flexion of the knee. However, the main function is likely to be provision of dynamic stability to the posterolateral part of the knee by preventing excessive lateral rotation of the tibia, partly by its direct action, but more significantly by tensing the popliteofibular ligament.</div></section></section></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0765"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0580">Muscles of the leg</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0905">The muscles of the leg consist of an anterior group of extensor muscles, which produce dorsiflexion (extension) of the ankle; a posterior group of flexor muscles, which produce plantar flexion (flexion); and a lateral group of muscles, which evert the ankle and are derived embryologically from the anterior muscle group.

The groove is converted into a canal by the superior fibular retinaculum, so that the tendon of fibularis longus and that of fibularis brevis, which lies in front of the longus tendon, are contained in a common synovial sheath. If the fibular retinaculum is ruptured by injury and fails to heal, the tendons can dislocate from the groove. The fibularis longus tendon runs obliquely forwards on the lateral side of the calcaneus, below the fibular trochlea and the tendon of fibularis brevis, and deep to the inferior fibular retinaculum. It crosses the lateral side of the cuboid and then runs under the cuboid in a groove that is converted into a canal by the long plantar ligament (see <a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793.xhtml#f0090">Fig. 79.18</a>). It crosses the sole of the foot obliquely and is attached by two slips, one to the lateral side of the base of the first metatarsal and one to the lateral aspect of the medial cuneiform (see <a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793.xhtml#f0030">Fig. 79.5A</a>); occasionally, a third slip is attached to the base of the second metatarsal. The tendon changes direction below the lateral malleolus and on the cuboid bone. At both sites it is thickened, and at the second site a sesamoid fibrocartilage (sometimes a bone, the os peroneum) is usually present. A second synovial sheath invests the tendon as it crosses the sole of the foot (see <a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793.xhtml#f0095">Fig. 79.21B</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0985"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0745">Relations</p><div class="textfl" id="p1065">Proximally, fibularis longus lies posterior to extensor digitorum longus and anterior to soleus and flexor hallucis longus.

The upper part of fibularis longus is also supplied by the circumflex fibular branch of the posterior tibial artery, which is usually a branch of the anterior tibial artery. The companion artery to the common fibular nerve, a branch of the popliteal artery, provides a minor contribution proximally.

It is not clear to what extent this helps to maintain plantigrade contact of the foot in normal standing, but electromyographic recordings show little or no fibular activity under these conditions. Fibularis longus and brevis come strongly into action to maintain the concavity of the foot during toe-off and tip-toeing.

It arises by two heads, connected to the condyles of the femur by strong, flat tendons. The medial, larger head is attached to a depression at the upper and posterior part of the medial condyle behind the adductor tubercle, and to a slightly raised area on the popliteal surface of the femur just above the medial condyle. The lateral head is attached to a recognizable area on the lateral surface of the lateral condyle and to the lower part of the corresponding supracondylar line (see <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0050">Fig. 77.12B</a>).

As the muscle descends, the muscle fibres begin to insert into a broad aponeurosis that develops on its anterior surface; up to this point, the muscular masses of the two heads remain separate.

Over the rest of its length, the muscle is superficial and the two heads can easily be seen in the living subject. The superficial surface of the muscle is separated by the deep fascia from the short saphenous vein and the fibular communicating and sural nerves. The common fibular nerve crosses behind the lateral head of the muscle, partly under cover of biceps femoris. The deep surface lies posterior to the oblique popliteal ligament, popliteus, soleus, plantaris, popliteal vessels and the tibial nerve. A bursa, which communicates with the knee joint, is located anterior to the tendon of the medial head (see <a href="#f0185">Fig. 78.37</a>); if the bursa expands into the popliteal fossa, it does so in the plane between the medial head of gastrocnemius and semimembranosus.

The muscles are usually large and correspondingly powerful. Gastrocnemius provides force for propulsion in walking, running and leaping. Soleus, acting from below, is said to be more concerned with steadying the leg on the foot in standing. This postural role is also suggested by its high content of slow, fatigue-resistant (type 1) muscle fibres. In many adult mammals the proportion of this type of fibre in soleus approaches 100%. However, such a rigid separation of functional roles seems unlikely in humans; soleus probably participates in locomotion, and gastrocnemius in posture. Nevertheless, the ankle joint is loose-packed in the erect posture, and since the weight of the body acts through a vertical line that passes anterior to the joint, a strong brace is required behind the joint to maintain stability. Electromyography shows that these forces are supplied mainly by soleus; during symmetrical standing, soleus is continuously active, whereas gastrocnemius is recruited only intermittently. The relative contributions of soleus and gastrocnemius to phasic activity of the triceps surae in walking have yet to be satisfactorily analysed.</div></section></section><section><a id="s1200"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0920">Deep flexor group</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1245">The deep flexor group (see <a href="#f0035"><span class="bold">Fig. 78.6</span></a>; <a href="#f0190"><span class="bold">Fig. 78.38</span></a>) lies beneath (anterior to) the transverse intermuscular septum and consists of popliteus, which acts on the knee joint, and flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus and tibialis posterior, which all produce plantar flexion at the ankle in addition to their specific actions on joints of the foot and digits.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0190"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000781/main.assets/f78-38-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0190"/><a id="fspara0190"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 78.38</span> Muscles of the left leg, posterior aspect. <span class="bold">A</span>, The superficial muscles have been extensively removed. <span class="bold">B</span>, The superficial muscles have been extensively removed, popliteus has been sectioned and the tendon of flexor digitorum longus removed as it crosses the tendon of tibialis posterior. <br/><span class="figcredit">With permission from Waschke J, Paulsen F (eds) Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy, 15th ed.

This tendon grooves the posterior surface of the lower end of the tibia, then, successively, the posterior surface of the talus and the inferior surface of the sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus (see <a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793.xhtml#f0015">Fig. 79.2B</a>).

When the foot is off the ground, both muscles flex the phalanges, acting primarily on the distal phalanges. When the foot is on the ground and under load, they act synergistically with the small muscles of the foot and, especially in the case of flexor digitorum longus, with the lumbricals and interossei to maintain the pads of the toes in firm contact with the ground, enlarging the weight-bearing area and helping to stabilize the heads of the metatarsals, which form the fulcrum on which the body is propelled forwards. Activity in the long digital flexors is minimal during quiet standing, so they apparently contribute little to the static maintenance of the longitudinal arch, but they become very active during toe-off and tip-toe movements.</div></section><section><a id="s1300"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle1000">Tibialis posterior</h5><section><a id="s1305"/><section><a id="s1310"/><section><a id="s1315"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle1005">Attachments</p><div class="textfl" id="p1330">Tibialis posterior is the most deeply placed muscle of the flexor group (see <a href="#f0205">Figs 78.6</a>, <a href="#f0190">78.38</a>). At its origin it lies between flexor hallucis longus and flexor digitorum longus, and is overlapped by both, but especially by the former. Its proximal attachment consists of two tapered processes, separated by an angular interval that is traversed by the anterior tibial vessels. The medial process arises from the posterior surface of the interosseous membrane, except at its most distal part, and from a lateral area on the posterior surface of the tibia between the soleal line above and the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the shaft below. The lateral part arises from a medial strip of the posterior fibular surface in its upper two-thirds (see <a href="#f0035">Figs 78.7B</a>, <a href="#f0040">78.8B</a>). The muscle also arises from the transverse intermuscular septum, and from the intermuscular septa that separate it from adjacent muscles. In the distal quarter of the leg, its tendon passes deep to that of flexor digitorum longus, with which it shares a groove behind the medial malleolus, each enclosed in a separate synovial sheath (see <a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793.xhtml#f0015">Fig. 79.2B</a>). It then passes deep to the flexor retinaculum and superficial to the deltoid ligament to enter the foot. In the foot, it is at first inferior to the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament, where it contains a sesamoid fibrocartilage. The tendon then divides into two. The more superficial and larger division, which is a direct continuation of the tendon, is attached to the tuberosity of the navicular, from which fibres continue to the inferior surface of the medial cuneiform. A tendinous band also passes laterally and a little proximally to the tip and distal margin of the sustentaculum tali. The deeper lateral division gives rise to the tendon of origin of the medial limb of flexor hallucis brevis, and then continues between this muscle and the navicular and medial cuneiform to end on the intermediate cuneiform and the bases of the second, third and fourth metatarsals; the slip to the fourth metatarsal is the strongest (see <a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793.xhtml#f0030">Fig. 79.5B</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1335">The slips to the metatarsals vary in number.

It is the principal invertor of the foot and also initiates elevation of the heel; it is responsible for the hindfoot varus that occurs during a single heel raise. Due to its insertions on to the cuneiforms and the bases of the metatarsals, it has long been thought to assist in elevating the longitudinal arch of the foot, although electromyography shows that it is actually quiescent in standing. It is phasically active in walking, during which it probably acts with the intrinsic foot musculature and the lateral leg muscles to control the degree of pronation of the foot and the distribution of weight through the metatarsal heads. It is said that when the body is supported on one leg, the invertor action of tibialis posterior, exerted from below, helps to maintain balance by resisting any tendency to sway laterally.</div><div class="text" id="p1360">Tibialis posterior is also important in the maintenance of the medial part of the longitudinal arch of the foot. In overweight individuals with pes planus (flat foot deformity), unaccustomed activity can result in inflammation and degeneration of the terminal portion of the tendon, which leads to elongation of the tendon, attenuation of the spring ligament and progressive collapse of the medial longitudinal arch. As the excursion is so short, the muscle cannot compensate for the lengthening of its tendon, a failure that results in tibialis posterior tendon dysfunction.</div></section><section><a id="s1340"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle1030">Testing</p><div class="textfl" id="p1365">Tibialis posterior is tested by asking the subject to move the foot into a position of maximal plantar flexion and inversion against the resistance of the examiner’s hand; the tendon can be seen and felt just proximal to the medial malleolus.

Varicose veins can occur as a consequence of venous valve failure at the proximal end of the long saphenous vein at the saphenofemoral junction, or in the perforating veins that pass from the superficial system to the high-pressure deep veins. Varicose veins have thin walls and ‘leak’ red blood cells into adjacent soft tissues. As these cells are broken down, haemosiderin is deposited in the soft tissues, resulting in a brown pigmentation. This phenomenon, together with the fact that venous stasis produces oedema, renders the soft tissues of the leg unhealthy and prone to ulceration, particularly after minor trauma.</div><div class="text" id="p1650">Acute venous disease occurs most commonly in the posterior compartment of the leg. This is attributed to the sluggish blood flow that occurs, at times, in the deep veins of the calf. This relative stasis predisposes to the formation of venous thrombi.

At the distal end of the canal, it leaves the artery and emerges through the aponeurotic covering with the saphenous branch of the descending genicular artery. As it leaves the adductor canal, it gives off an infrapatellar branch that contributes to the peripatellar plexus and then pierces the fascia lata between the tendons of sartorius and gracilis, becoming subcutaneous to supply the skin anterior to the patella.

The nerve may also become entrapped by a fascial band beneath fibularis longus within the so-called fibular tunnel, between the attachments of fibularis longus to the head and shaft of the fibula (<a href="../B9780702077050000781/B9780702077050000781_split_a.xhtml#bib58" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_58">van den Bergh et al 2013</a>). Traction lesions can accompany dislocations of the lateral compartment of the knee, and are most likely to occur if the distal attachments of biceps femoris and the ligaments that insert on to the fibular head are avulsed, possibly with a small part of the fibular head; the nerve is tethered to the tendon of biceps femoris by dense fascia and so is pulled proximally. Severe traction lesions may produce longitudinal injuries affecting a long segment of the common fibular nerve. Torsional injury following ankle injury (sprain or fracture) may result in common fibular neuropathy; the injury is transmitted from the ankle along the interosseous membrane to the proximal leg (<a href="../B9780702077050000781/B9780702077050000781_split_a.xhtml#bib33" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_33">Lalezari et al 2012</a>). Patients with such injury present with a foot drop. Physical examination reveals weakness or paralysis of ankle dorsiflexion, toe extension and eversion of the foot, but inversion and plantar flexion are normal. Sensation on the dorsum of the foot, including the first dorsal web space, is diminished. The ankle reflex is preserved. Since the common fibular nerve divides at the fibular neck into the superficial and deep fibular nerves, injuries to the nerve at this level may damage either the main trunk or its branches. Electrodiagnostic studies can help localize a common fibular nerve injury to the fibular neck region. At this level, nerve conduction studies may show slowed velocities and electromyography would demonstrate denervation in the muscles innervated by the common fibular nerve (such as tibialis anterior or fibularis longus), whereas more proximally innervated muscles (particularly the short head of biceps femoris) would be normal.</div></section></section><section><a id="s1775"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle1390">Superficial fibular nerve</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1750">The superficial fibular nerve (superficial peroneal nerve) begins at the bifurcation of the common fibular nerve.
