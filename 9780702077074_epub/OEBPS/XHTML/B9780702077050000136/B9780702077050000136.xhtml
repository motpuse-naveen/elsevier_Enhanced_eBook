Major restructuring of early vessels occurs as the embryo grows; anastomoses form and then disappear, capillaries fuse and give rise to arteries or veins, and the direction of blood flow may reverse several times before the final arrangement of vessels is completed.

Later, this splanchnopleuric coelomic epithelium is also the source of the epicardium, the coronary arteries and the interstitial fibroblasts of the heart. (The epicardium, sometimes included in descriptions of the myocardium as ‘epimyocardium’, is not present at early stages of heart development.) A further cell population of head neural crest mesenchyme that arises from the region between the otic vesicle and the caudal limit of somite 3 later migrates to the arterial pole of the heart and contributes to the formation of the valves and aortic arch arteries (see <a href="../B9780702077050000173/B9780702077050000173.xhtml#f0050">Fig. 17.9</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0020">The position of the developing myocardium is intimately related to the formation of the intraembryonic coelom and the relative movement of that tubular structure during neurulation and somitogenesis.

This plexus of cells, formed initially by vasculogenesis and subsequently from angioblastic mesenchyme, is one of the earliest intraembryonic vascular precursors to appear. The cells express molecular markers of both the myocardial and the endothelial cell lineages, indicating that the endocardium has a different origin than other endothelial populations.

The dorsal mesocardium is contiguous with the splanchnopleuric mesenchyme that surrounds the embryonic foregut and the developing lung buds and is the site of early mediastinal mesenchyme production. It disappears as a mesenteric entity in embryos with 8–12 somites. The partial breakdown of the dorsal mesocardium creates the transverse sinus of the pericardium that extends across the pericardial cavity from side to side, dorsal to the heart. Persisting dorsal mesocardium at the venous pole remains connected to the splanchnopleuric mesenchyme in which the pulmonary veins will develop; it is also confluent with the septum transversum mesenchyme, in which the liver will later develop.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">By stage 10 (28–29 days postfertilization; embryonic stages 10–23 correlated to postfertilization days of development and postmenstrual weeks of pregnancy are shown in <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 23.3</a>) a single endocardial tube is established that is almost completely surrounded by myocardial cells. This arrangement of an outer myocardial sleeve containing an inner endocardial tube constitutes the primary heart tube. The primary myocardium will not only give rise to the major parts of the conduction system of the heart, including the sinus node, the atrioventricular node, and the atrioventricular bundle, but also to part of the floor of the right atrium (the vestibule) and the entire atrioventricular canal. An enlarging space between the endocardial tube and the developing myocardium is filled by a meshwork of cardiac extracellular matrix proteins, produced by the cardiac myocytes, which promotes occlusion of some parts of the early heart tube during myocardial contraction and mechanical assistance for the generation of flow of early blood. There are heterochronic differences between species in these processes, for example, in the mouse, cardiac chambers start to form before a distinct linear heart tube has appeared.</div><section><a id="s0015"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0025">Endocardial cushions</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0050">The extracellular matrix of the embryonic heart (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 13.3C–D</a>), historically termed cardiac jelly, is composed of hyaluronic acid, hyaluronidase and fibronectin among other components. Inductive signals originating from the cardiac myocytes, such as BMP2 and TGF-β, lead to the activation of a subset of endocardial epithelial cells that will line the future atrioventricular canal and the proximal outflow tract; in the future left ventricle, endocardial cells do not undergo such an activation. The activated endocardial cells lose their cell-to-cell connections and undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Their expression of neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) decreases and expression of substrate adhesion molecules such as chondroitin sulphate and fibronectin increases. Expression of type I procollagen is initiated and cytoskeletal re-arrangements facilitate cell migration into the cardiac extracellular matrix where they continue to proliferate. The cells and the locally accumulated extracellular matrix molecules, form the endocardial or cardiac cushions. Endocardial cushions initially function as valves in the embryonic heart: they give rise to the valves of the atrioventricular canal and the outflow tract and also supply the mesenchyme that is needed to complete the septation of the atria, ventricles and the outflow tract. This particular epithelial to mesenchymal transition may be the only example of a mesenchymal population derived from an endothelial lineage; endothelial to mesenchymal transformation may be relevant to later circulatory pathologies (<a href="#bib85" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_85">Suzuki et al 2018</a>, <a href="#bib53" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_53">Kovacic et al 2019</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0030">Looping of the heart tube</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0055">The early primary heart tube is initially bilaterally symmetric and has the form of an inverted ‘Y’.

The expression of sarcomeric proteins is seen in primitive cardiomyocytes in stage 9 embryos. All cardiac myocytes share the capacity for producing an intrinsic cycle of electrical activity, i.e. the capacity to generate and conduct a depolarizing impulse that results in contraction (the cells are myogenic): the phenomenon is called automaticity, or pacemaker activity. Because the cells are electrically coupled the fastest pacemaking activity will take the lead. In embryonic hearts, the leading pacemaker is always found at the venous pole which corresponds to the sinuatrial node in the adult heart. There is evidence for the presence of a tertiary heart-forming field specific for pacemaker formation (<a href="#bib56" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_56">Liang et al 2017</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0085">All of the cardiac conduction system is myocardial in origin. The nodes, sinuatrial and atrioventricular, and the atrioventricular bundle constitute the central conduction system, while the bundle branches and their terminal ramifications, the Purkinje fibres, represent the peripheral ventricular conduction system. The development of the conduction system of the heart is intimately related to overall heart formation and the blood flow through the heart, embryo and placenta. The underlying gene-regulatory networks have been conserved during vertebrate evolution. Each phase of heart development shows different patterns of spontaneous electrical activation and contraction (<a href="#bib96" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_96">Watanabe et al 2016</a>).<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="212" id="pagebreak_212"/><a id="pg212"/></div><div class="text" id="p0090">Varying degrees of differentiation seen in early populations of cardiac myocytes can be categorized as forming primary, nodal, conducting and working myocardium (<a href="#t0010"><span class="bold">Table 13.1</span></a>). There is a relationship between the degree of apparent differentiation and extent of the coupling between myocytes, and the occurrence of slow or fast wave propagation and corresponding contraction. All regions of the early embryonic heart tube have poorly coupled cells and display intrinsic automaticity (<span class="bold">Video 13.1</span>). This produces slow wave propagation of the depolarizing impulse along the heart tube and matching peristaltic waves of contraction that push the blood in an antegrade direction. That part of the early heart tube wall termed primary myocardium retains this phenotype; it shows poorly developed sarcoplasmic reticulum and sarcomeric structures. Poor electrical coupling and slow conduction seen in nodal myocytes is an absolute requirement for effective pacemaking because it allows the cells to build up sufficient electrical charge, which is then propagated through the surrounding myocardium. Cells that differentiate into working myocardium display virtually no automaticity. They have well developed sarcomeres and sarcoplasmic reticular structures, and contiguous cells show well developed gap junctions expressing connexins 40 and 43. The cells of the putative atrioventricular and peripheral ventricular conduction system have an ambiguous phenotype: they are well coupled, thus allowing fast conduction of the depolarizing impulse, but otherwise retain an embryonic phenotype. Myocytes of the atrioventricular bundles and Purkinje fibres have a phenotype between that of working and primary myocardium. Distinguishing conduction myocardium from working myocardium may suggest that the working myocardium does not conduct, while the conduction system conducts rapidly. However, to produce powerful synchronous contractions, the working myocardium must also conduct rapidly. Unambiguous morphological markers are often lacking in the early embryonic heart, which means that it is not possible to distinguish the various cells phenotypically; automaticity and the speed of conduction have therefore become important functional parameters with which to describe the development of the different parts of the heart.</div><section><a id="st0010"/><div class="pageavoid"><p class="tnum">TABLE 13.1</p><div class="big_device"><table id="t0010" class="tbody"><caption class="ttitle"><a id="tspara0010"/>Basic phenotypes of cardiac myocytes</caption><thead><tr><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">Feature</th><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1" colspan="4">Type of myocardium</th></tr><tr><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1"/><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">‘Primary’</th><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">‘Nodal’</th><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">‘Conducting’</th><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">‘Working’</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope="row" class="tb">Automaticity</th><td class="tb">High</td><td class="tb">High</td><td class="tb">High</td><td class="tb">Low</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="tb">Conduction velocity</th><td class="tb">Low</td><td class="tb">Low</td><td class="tb">High</td><td class="tb">High</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="tb">Contractility</th><td class="tb">Low</td><td class="tb">Low</td><td class="tb">Low</td><td class="tb">High</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="tb">Sarcoplasmic reticulum</th><td class="tb">Low</td><td class="tb">Low</td><td class="tb">Low</td><td class="tb">High</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="small_device"><p class="table_fig"><img src="B9780702077050000136_t0010_0.png" alt="image"/></p></div><footer><p class="tftnote"><span class="italic">Nodal myocardium as found in the sinus node and AV node derives directly from primary myocardium.

During development, specific regions of mesenchyme and cardiac extracellular matrix fulfil this function. The sequential arrangement of slow and fast conduction portions of the early myocardium is key to its early development. The fast conducting working myocardium of the atrial and ventricular chambers permits nearly simultaneous contraction, increasing the velocity of the forward pressure of blood. The slow conducting primary myocardium within the atrioventricular junction and outflow tract is adjacent to endocardial cushions formed from locally accumulated cardiac extracellular matrix. These regions have longer, slower closure and are thus able to function as sphincteric valves, preventing retrograde flow of blood.

Later, a cranial part of the right sinuatrial valve leaflet, caudal to the septum spurium, becomes continuous with the crista terminalis, a ridge that projects from the atrial roof. More caudally, the right sinuatrial valve leaflet forms the valve of the inferior vena cava (Eustachian valve) and of the original left superior vena cava, later the valve of the coronary sinus (Thebesian valve).

Although it is possible to distinguish the left from the right atrial appendage around stage 14, the right being more extensive than the left, the atrium itself contains only a single cavity at this stage.

The atrial floor or vestibule normally becomes Tbx3-negative and connexin 40-positive as a result of the ingrowth of myocardium from the secondary heart-forming field, while the sinus node and atrioventricular node, derivatives from the primary myocardium, retain their molecular phenotype.

While the tributaries of the sinus venosus approach the right atrium caudally and cranially, the differentiating pulmonary veins gain their entrance to the left atrial cavity through the dorsal mesocardium (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 13.3</a>). The definitive topographical relationships between vessels and heart seen postnatally are therefore only established once differentiation of the pulmonary venous portal occurs.</div><div class="text" id="p0165">Around stage 14, simultaneously with atrial septation, the pulmonary vein develops as a solitary channel from angiogenic cells derived from the dorsal mesocardium. This channel establishes continuity with the vascular plexus formed in the mediastinal mesenchyme around the developing lung buds. The initially solitary pulmonary vein, guided by Semaphorin 3d signals, later opens into the caudo-dorsal wall of the atrium adjacent to the developing atrioventricular junction, where a depression termed the pulmonary pit, flanked by the pulmonary ridges, has already been established (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Degenhardt et al 2013</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0170">The primary atrial septum develops from the right pulmonary ridge, confining the pulmonary venous orifice to the developing left atrium (see <a href="#f0060"><span class="bold">Fig. 13.11</span></a>). The pulmonary vein initially branches within the dorsal mediastinal mesenchyme, its tributaries draining blood from the developing lung. With continuing development, the walls of the pulmonary venous channels become surrounded by myocardium; this process occurs up to and beyond the level of the second bifurcation. The veins then expand and their walls become incorporated into the roof of the left atrium, eventually forming the greater part of its cavity. The four pulmonary veins do not achieve their separate opening into the atrial roof until well after septum formation is completed, around postmenstrual week 11. The left half of the primary atrium becomes progressively restricted to the mature appendage. The myocardial sleeves that surround the pulmonary orifices taper off distally and become intermingled with fibrous tissue. In adult life, it is likely that this intermingling of myocardial and fibrous tissues forms the substrate for some forms of atrial fibrillation.

As a consequence of the heart tube looping, the right ventricle is positioned to the right of the left ventricle, which is a prerequisite for forming the appropriate connections with the expanding atrial component of the heart. Unlike the atrial chambers, the morphological differences between the right and left ventricles are not part of the general asymmetry between the right- and left-sided organs of the body, but under the control of signalling pathways that determine caudocranial differentiation, such as retinoic acid and its downstream transcription factor Tbx5, which play a crucial role in this process.

Trabecular cardiomyocytes proliferate much less and exhibit more mitochondrial activity than compact wall cardiomyocytes, and are likely to be the main contributor to pressure generation.

It is typically described in terms of two septa that separate the endocardial and myocardial walls of the common atrium and two foramina that ensure continuous blood flow. Atrial septation starts at about stage 13 with proliferation of a crescentic ridge of mesenchyme in the atrial roof. This ridge, the septum primum, grows by active proliferation from the craniodorsal atrial roof towards the atrioventricular canal, just to the right of the entrance of the pulmonary vein (pulmonary pit) (<a href="#f0060">Fig. 13.11A,D</a>). Its leading edge is covered by a mesenchymal cap which is continuous with extracardiac mesenchyme (mediastinal mesenchyme) derived from the dorsal mesocardium that forms a dorsal mesenchymal protrusion. Under the influence of BMP signalling, the ventral horn of the crescentic septum primum will touch the ventral atrioventricular cushion, while the dorsal horn will fuse with the dorsal atrioventricular cushion. The primary atrial foramen (foramen or ostium primum) is therefore entirely surrounded by mesenchyme, subjacent to the atrial endocardium. Caudal to the advancing edge of the septum primum, the developing atrial chambers still communicate through the foramen primum (see <a href="#f0060">Fig. 13.11A,D</a>). The foramen primum diminishes in size as a result of continuous growth of the muscular primary atrial septum and the cranial part of the septum perforates by apoptosis. The perforations coalesce, producing a secondary atrial foramen (foramen, or ostium, secundum) that allows continued shunting of oxygen-enriched blood from the placenta to the left side of the heart and so to the head and brain. The foramen secundum forms during stages 15–17. The foramen primum is occluded in the median plane by stage 17, when the septum primum mesenchyme merges with the fusing atrioventricular (<a href="#f0060">Fig. 13.11B,E</a>). This tissue later differentiates to myocardium and forms a ridge that will become the limbus of the future fossa ovalis.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0060"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000136/main.assets/f13-11-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0050"/><a id="fspara0050"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 13.11</span> Three representative stages in the development of the atrial septum. <span class="bold">A–C</span>, Coronal views from the front. <span class="bold">D–F</span>, Lateral views from the right side. <span class="bold">A</span> and <span class="bold">D</span>, At stage 14 the primary atrial septum has not yet obliterated the original communication between the two atria (primary atrial foramen) and the atrioventricular endocardial cushions have not yet fused.

This passage through the foramen ovale, persists throughout intrauterine life (see Videos 13.2, 23.1).

It is often the result of failure of the flap valve (septum primum) to fuse completely with the infolded muscular rim of the septum secundum. This type of atrial septal defect is known as a persistent foramen ovale. When the flap valve is still able to overlap the rim, the communication is of little or no functional significance as long as the left atrial pressure is greater than the right, which is usually the case in healthy individuals. However, when the pressure in the right atrium increases during sneezing, when diving, or in the case of pulmonary hypertension, there is a risk of some blood entering the left atrium directly, bypassing the pulmonary circulation (<a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Briggs et al 2012</a>).

Foramen primum defects occur when the mesenchymal cap of the septum primum does not fuse with the atrioventricular cushions, resulting in an interatrial communication. Deficient growth of the dorsal mesenchymal protrusion may also result in foramen primum defects: this is an atrioventricular septal defect permitting exclusively atrial shunting (<a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Jensen et al 2016</a>, <a href="#bib97" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_97">Wessels 2016</a>).</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0160"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0125">Septation and appropriate positioning of the atrioventricular canal</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0265">The atrioventricular canal is initially a continuation of myocardium between the common atrium and the primitive ventricle. Four cardiac cushions are formed at the margin of this canal, namely: the left and right cushions, and the much larger ventral and dorsal cushions. The single orifice of the atrioventricular canal is divided by the approximation and later merger of the ventral and dorsal cushions. The dorsal atrioventricular cushion runs along the floor of the atrium. As it extends further dorsally it meets the dorsal mesenchymal protrusion (spina vestibuli) that connects with the mesenchymal cap that runs along the leading edge of the septum primum until it meets the ventral atrioventricular cushion (see <a href="#f0060">Fig. 13.11</a>). The dorsal atrioventricular cushion has a ventricular extension to the inner curvature of the heart tube that comes to lie on top of the developing muscular ventricular septum: much of the membranous septum of the ventricles is derived from this extension.</div><div class="text" id="p0270">The two atrioventricular cushions fuse during stages 14–17, at which time they become known as the central fibrous body.

Two major subgroups of atrioventricular defects are identified. The more frequent is complete atrioventricular defect, characterized by a common atrioventricular orifice and the potential for shunting through the septal defect at both atrial and ventricular levels (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 13.12B</a>). The common atrioventricular orifice is guarded by a single common valve, with superior and inferior leaflets that bridge the scooped-out ventricular septum. The valve is tethered to both right and left ventricles. Although the left component of this valve is often interpreted as a ‘cleft mitral valve’, it bears no resemblance to the normally structured mitral valve because it has three leaflets where the ‘cleft’ forms the zone of apposition between the left ventricular components of the ventral and dorsal bridging leaflets. The less common incomplete atrioventricular septal defect has separate right and left atrioventricular orifices and shunting occurs only at the atrial level. Occasionally, when the bridging leaflets are attached to the underside of the atrial septum, shunting is minor and confined to the ventricular level (<a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Briggs et al 2012</a>).</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0180"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0135">Septation of the ventricles</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0285">Three distinct structures contribute to the formation of the ventricular septum: the atrioventricular cushions (including the protrusion of the dorsal atrioventricular cushion that lies on the ventricular septal crest), the muscular ventricular septum and the proximal parts of the outflow cushions. Separation of the right and left ventricles is heralded by the appearance of a caudal crescentic ridge within the ventricular loop (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 13.7</a>). This is a persisting part of the Tbx3 and G1N2-positive primary heart tube myocardium, which means that the crest of the septum is the oldest portion of the developing ventricular septum. The ventricles (especially those parts that will become the apex of the heart) become enlarged as if they were expanding like balloons on either side of the muscular ventricular septum (see <a href="#f0025">Figs 13.4</a>, <a href="#f0040">13.7</a>). Later, the dorsal part of the crest of the septum will become the atrioventricular bundle, while the atrioventricular node will form at the dorsal atrioventricular junction (see <a href="#f0060">Fig. 13.10C</a>). The ventral parts will largely disappear except <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="218" id="pagebreak_218"/>the so-called ‘dead-end tract’ (<a href="#bib4" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_4">Anderson et al 2016</a>, <a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_22">de Vries et al 2016</a>). The crest of the septum, covered by an extension of the dorsal atrioventricular cushion, together with the fused atrioventricular cushions themselves, bounds the ovoid interventricular foramen. The Tbx3 and G1N2-positive myocardium that surrounds this foramen marks a ring composed of primary myocardium which is smooth (see <a href="#f0055">Fig. 13.10</a>). Completion of ventricular septation is seen after a rightward shift of the atrioventricular canal and the positioning of the outflow tract between the separating atrioventricular canals so that it too overrides the developing ventricular septum. The foramen finally closes by formation of the membranous septum that completely separates the right from the left ventricle (see <a href="#f0070">Fig. 13.13</a>). During ventricular septation, transition from the early ventricular base-to-apex conduction activation to an apex-to-base conduction is initiated. Maturation of the ventricular conduction system, with concomitant development of the fibrous rings of the heart, continues throughout fetal development (<a href="#bib96" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Watanabe et al 2016</a>).</div><section><a id="s0185"/><section><a id="s0190"/><section><a id="s0195"/><h4 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0140">Ventricular septal defects</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0295">Ventricular septal defects account for approximately two-thirds of all cardiac septal defects; the worldwide prevalence is 2.6/1000 live births (34% of the most common congenital heart disease subtypes) (<a href="#bib92" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">van der Linde et al 2011</a>, <a href="#bib100" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_100">Xie et al 2017</a>). The inappropriate formation and connection of the atrioventricular cushions to the muscular ventricular septum results in a perimembranous ventricular septal defect (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 13.12C</a>). The membranous septum, and by extension a perimembranous ventricular septal defect, is closely associated with the area of insertion of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. A perimembranous defect can also extend further into the ventricular outlet beneath the supraventricular crest that borders the right ventricle from the outflow tract. Perimembranous ventricular septal defects are often associated with the aortic orifice overriding the crest of the muscular septum, i.e. ‘overriding aorta’. When combined with pulmonary stenosis or atresia, this forms the basis for the syndrome of Fallot’s tetralogy. The last feature of the tetralogy, right ventricular hypertrophy, which developed in infancy in the untreated child, is now usually seen in cases where an affected child does not have timely surgical repair. The condition does not cause important haemodynamic imbalance during fetal life (<a href="#bib112" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_112">Wohlmuth and Gardiner 2020</a>). When the pulmonary trunk is normal or even dilated with this combination of anomalies, it is known as the Eisenmenger complex. Perimembranous defects can also occur with abnormal ventriculoarterial connections. Taussig–Bing anomaly occurs when, in a case of transposition of the great arteries, the pulmonary trunk overrides the muscular septum, causing both arteries to connect to the right ventricle and the ventricular septum is also defective. In perimembranous ventricular septal defects, the atrioventricular bundle and its right and left branches are still always found along the dorsal and caudal margins of the defect.</div><div class="text" id="p0300">Less commonly, a septal defect may be found in the ventricular outflow tract underneath the conjoined facing leaflets of the aortic and pulmonary valves. Such juxta-arterial defects are doubly committed, in that they open beneath the orifices of both aortic and pulmonary valves. They are the result of the failure of formation of the free-standing muscular sub-pulmonary infundibulum, which links them to persistent truncus arteriosus anomalies, but the ventriculoarterial junctions are appropriately separated. These defects usually have a muscular dorsocaudal rim that protects the atrioventricular bundle: the defect can sometimes extend to the membranous septum.</div><div class="text" id="p0305">A third type of ventricular septal defect occurs within the musculature of the septum. Defects may affect all parts of the septum and can be multiple, producing a so-called ‘Swiss cheese’ septum (<a href="#bib83" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_83">Spicer et al 2014</a>).</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0200"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0145">Septation and appropriate positioning of the outflow tract</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0310">The appearance of two outflow cushions is key to the separation of the outflow tract (truncus arteriosus).

Within the developing aortic sac, a transverse wedge of tissue composed of dorsal mediastinal mesenchyme, the aortopulmonary septum, initially separates the origins of the aorta and the pulmonary trunk before their individual walls are formed. Meanwhile, neural crest cells migrate from the pharyngeal mediastinal myocardium into the outflow cushions.

As the atrioventricular valves develop, the epicardium and the endocardial cushions fuse at the ventricular margin of the canal, disrupting the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="219" id="pagebreak_219"/>myocardial continuity. Only the prospective atrioventricular conduction axis is spared from disruption. The sites of myocardial disruption later form the anulus fibrosus, a collagenous structure that physically insulates the atria from the ventricles. If anulus fibrosus formation is disrupted, accessory strands of myocardium between the atria and ventricles may persist and can become aberrantly differentiated thereby becoming able to propagate the electrical impulse. This can lead to early excitation of the ventricles and can act as a substrate for re-entry ventricular tachycardias as seen in Wolf–Parkinson–White syndrome.</div><div class="text" id="p0350">Although molecular lineage studies in the mouse have demonstrated that the atrioventricular cushions are initially entirely populated by endocardium-derived mesenchymal cells, they later receive a significant epicardial contribution.

Each valve leaflet develops functionally significant regional variations in surface texture while its core condenses as a collagenous fibrous lamina, supported either by the fibro-fatty tissue of the atrioventricular groove, or by the anulus fibrosus. In the mitral valve, the aortic leaflet forms before the mural leaflet. Both are fully delaminated from the myocardial wall by postmenstrual week 10. The formation of the inferior leaflet of the tricuspid valve is followed by the formation of the septal and, later, the anterosuperior leaflets.

They can leave the circulation, demonstrate surface adhesion molecules and form tight associations with other EryPs in the adjacent mesenchymal tissue surrounding early vessels. Over time, circulating EryPs continue to mature, as their cell diameter decreases and they lose nucleoli.

Early blood vessels are initially surrounded by a fibronectin-rich matrix that is later incorporated into the endothelial basal lamina along with laminin, a particularly early constituent. Several layers of fibronectin-expressing cells are seen around larger vessels, such as the dorsal aortae. The endothelium does not synthesize a basal lamina in those regions where remodelling and angiogenesis are active, and the mesenchyme around such endothelium does not express α-actin or laminin until branching has stopped and differentiation of the tunica media begins (after a stable vascular pattern has formed).

Three principles operate in embryonic vasculature: if the flow increases or decreases the blood vessel calibre increases or decreases to normalize the shear stress; if the blood pressure in the vessel increases or decreases the vessel wall thickens or thins respectively, mainly by the modulation of the amount of smooth muscle; increase in capillary pressure leads to new capillary growth (<a href="#bib76" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_76">Roman and Pekkan 2012</a>). Endothelial cells are mechanosensitive, they are able to respond to laminar and disturbed blood flows and are sensitive to blood viscosity. Very complex interactions occur throughout the development of the circulation; cardiac rate increases with development and cardiac output increases in proportion to the weight of the embryo, so that when dorsal aortic blood flow is matched to embryonic weight, blood flow remains constant over a more than 150-fold change in the mass of the embryo.

After fusion of the dorsal aortae, they merge as unpaired trunks that are distributed to the increasingly defined and lengthening primitive digestive tube. Longitudinal anastomotic channels connect these branches along the dorsal and ventral aspects of the tube, forming dorsal and ventral splanchnic anastomoses (see <a href="#f0090">Figs 13.17</a>, <a href="#f0095">13.18</a>). Above the respiratory diaphragm, a variable number of ventral splanchnic arteries persist, usually four or five, and supply the thoracic oesophagus. The dorsal splanchnic anastomosis persists in the gastro-omental (gastroepiploic), pancreaticoduodenal and primary branches of the colic arteries, whereas the ventral splanchnic anastomosis forms the right and left gastric and the hepatic arteries. Below the diaphragm, the ventral splanchnic arteries are reduced to three: the coeliac trunk and the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. As the viscera supplied descend into the abdomen, <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="223" id="pagebreak_223"/><a id="pg223"/>their origins migrate caudally by differential growth. Thus the origin of the coeliac artery is transferred from the level of C7 to the level of T12; the superior mesenteric from T2 to L1; and the inferior mesenteric from T12 to L3. The superior mesenteric artery extends along the axis of the midgut loop into the extraembryonic coelom from stage 14 until 9 postfertilization weeks. As the proximal limb of the midgut loop develops secondary and tertiary loops, the artery gives rise to a series of branches. At stage 23 eight branches have arisen from the intra-abdominal portion of the artery, with the first three supplying the most proximal portion of the midgut loop. The third branch is bifurcated and supplies the midgut at the umbilical opening. The distal parts of the intra-abdominal branches 5–8 extend into the mesentery within the extraembryonic coelom, and all of the remaining branches, 9–14, supply that part of the midgut loop outside the embryonic body. The distance between the individual branches 9–14 are longer than those between branches 5–8. A colic branch arises consistently on the cranial side of the artery between branches 7 and 9 (<a href="#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_38">Hikspoors et al 2015</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0340"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0260">Early vitelline arteries</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0550">Vitelline arteries form in the vitelline arterial plexus around the secondary yolk sac and become confluent with the dorsal aortae in stage 12. By stage 13 communication between the embryonic body and yolk sac is limited to a single vitelline artery arising from the splanchnic branches of the dorsal aorta and running rostral to the narrowing vitelline duct (see <a href="#f0090">Fig. 13.17</a>). During stage 14 the artery with the vitelline duct is a landmark for the apex of the midgut loop within the splanchnopleuric mesenchyme of the dorsal mesentery. The vitelline artery is not a patent vessel at stage 16: its proximal origin becomes the origin of the superior mesenteric artery (<a href="#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Hikspoors et al 2015</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0345"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0265">Early umbilical arteries</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0555">Initially, the umbilical arteries are the direct caudal continuation of the primitive dorsal aortae (see <a href="#f0090">Fig. 13.17</a>). They are present in the body stalk (connecting stalk) before any vitelline or visceral branches emerge, indicating the dominance of the allantoic over the vitelline circulation in the human embryo. (On a comparative basis, the umbilical vessels are chorio-allantoic and therefore ‘somatovisceral’.) After the dorsal aortae fuse, right and left umbilical arteries arise from their ventrolateral aspects and pass lateral to the allantois in the connecting stalk (see <a href="#f0090">Figs 13.17</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000227/B9780702077050000227.xhtml#f0010">22.1</a>). Later, the proximal part of each umbilical artery is joined by a new vessel that leaves the aorta at its termination and passes lateral to the allantois. This, possibly the fifth lumbar intersegmental artery, constitutes the dorsal root of the umbilical artery (the original stem forms the ventral root). The dorsal root gives off the axial artery of the lower limb, branches to the pelvic viscera and, more proximally, the external iliac artery. The ventral root disappears entirely and the umbilical artery now arises from that part of its dorsal root distal to the external iliac artery, i.e. the internal iliac artery.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0350"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0270">Embryonic veins</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0275">Early veins</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0355"/><div class="textfl" id="p0560">The early embryonic veins are often segregated into two groups, visceral and somatic, for convenience and apparent simplicity. The visceral group contains the derivatives of the vitelline and umbilical veins, and the somatic group includes all remaining veins. It should be noted that, with time, embryonic veins change the principal tissues they drain. They may receive radicles from obviously parietal tissues, which become confluent with drainage channels that are clearly visceral, and so form a compound vessel. The arrangement of the early embryonic veins is initially symmetric (see <a href="#f0090">Fig. 13.17</a>). The primitive tubular symmetric heart receives its venous return through the right and left horns of the sinus venosus, which are initially embedded in the mesenchyme of the septum transversum. Each horn receives vitelline, umbilical and the common cardinal veins (see <a href="#f0045">Fig. 13.8</a>).

The cardinal venous complexes are first represented by two large vessels on each side, the precardinal portion is rostral and the postcardinal is caudal to the heart. The two vessels unite to form a short common cardinal vein which passes ventrally to open into the corresponding horn of the sinus venosus (see <a href="#f0010">Figs 13.1B</a>, <a href="#f0090">13.17A</a>; <a href="#f0100"><span class="bold">Fig. 13.19B</span></a>). Further development of the precardinal veins directing the venous drainage of the head and arms to the right gives rise to the superior vena cava.

The left vitelline vein lies within the dorsal mesentery between the proximal and distal parts of the midgut loop. In stage 14 embryos, the right vitelline vein is cranial to the proximal midgut loop within the mesenchyme surrounding the vitelline duct; from stage 16 onwards it appears disconnected from this mesenchyme and free within the abdominal cavity alongside the vitelline duct. Its course forms the central axis of the primary midgut loop and marks the apex of the loop until the return of the herniated small intestine to the abdominal cavity (<a href="#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Hikspoors et al 2015</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0430"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0345">Later umbilical veins</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0660">The further development of the vitelline veins and their anastomoses is closely interlocked with the growth of hepatic sinusoids in the septum transversum and changes to the umbilical veins. Evagination of hepatic ‘cords’ of presumptive hepatocytes from the endodermal foregut into the septum transversum mesenchyme initiates the formation of early plexiform connections of the hepatic sinusoids. As these expand laterally and extend caudally, they merge with the terminal connections of the vitelline and umbilical veins and subsume them within a series of complex branching vessels conducting blood in and out of the hepatic sinusoids.</div><div class="text" id="p0665">Both deoxygenated and oxygenated blood enter the developing hepatic sinusoids, in the same way as the adult liver sinusoids convey portal and systemic blood. However, in the embryo and fetus, both blood supplies travel within veins. Vitelline veins from the extraembryonic yolk sac and the intraembryonic developing gut carry deoxygenated blood, and umbilical veins carry oxygenated blood from the placenta. All of these vessels branch and enter the liver via afferent hepatic veins, the venae advehentes. Blood leaves the hepatic sinusoids through four efferent hepatic veins, the venae revehentes; these are the terminal ends of the right and left vitelline veins, and the right and left umbilical veins, now termed hepatocardiac veins, all of which enter the sinus venosus (<a href="#f0110"><span class="bold">Fig. 13.21</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0110"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000136/main.assets/f13-20-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0110"/><a id="fspara0110"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 13.21</span> Development of the vitelline, umbilical and terminal cardinal vein complexes: a mid-stage of asymmetry has been reached between the early symmetric condition (see <a href="#f0105">Fig. 13.20</a>) and the definitive late prenatal state.

The right umbilical vein regresses and atrophies during stages 14–15 (see <a href="#f0110">Fig. 13.21</a>). The hepatic terminal of the left umbilical vein retains some vessels that discharge into the sinusoids, but blood flow preferentially enlarges connections with the left half of the subhepatic (ventral duodenal) intervitelline anastomosis. These connections form a channel, the ductus venosus, which courses to the right half of the subdiaphragmatic anastomosis to join the right hepatocardiac channel (the termination of the right vitelline vein) and empty into the inferior vena cava (see <a href="#f0110">Fig. 13.21</a>; <a href="#f0115"><span class="bold">Fig. 13.22</span></a>). The portal vein is derived from presumptive superior mesenteric and splenic veins that pass via the intermediate (dorsal duodenal) intervitelline anastomosis into the liver sinusoids via a right vena advehente. Blood in the umbilical vein supplies the left lobe of the liver and ductus venosus; the right lobe of the liver receives blood from the portal circulation. This arrangement means that the left lobe of the liver receives the most oxygenated blood returning from the placenta: the remainder (proportions change during the third trimester) passes into the ductus venosus and, via haemodynamic streaming, to the inferior vena cava and right atrium, then through the foramen ovale to the left atrium, to supply heart muscle and brain.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0115"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000136/main.assets/f13-21-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0115"/><a id="fspara0115"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 13.22</span> The condition of some main upper abdominal and intrathoracic right atrial terminal veins in the later prenatal months.

The dorsal aorta between the third and fourth aortic arches, the carotid duct, diminishes and ultimately disappears. From the fourth arch to the origin of the seventh intersegmental artery, the right dorsal aorta becomes part of the right subclavian artery, and caudal to the seventh intersegmental artery, the right dorsal aorta disappears up to the site where the thoracic aortae fuse. The remnants of the left carotid duct are found in the descending part of the aortic arch. The fused right and left embryonic dorsal aortae persist as the definitive descending thoracic and abdominal aorta.</div><div class="text" id="p0705">Concomitant changes also occur in the early venous system. The precardinal veins enlarge as the embryo develops.

These parts of the original precardinal vein, rostral to the subclavian veins, are now the internal jugular veins, and their confluences are the brachiocephalic veins. The right and left common cardinal veins are originally of the same diameter but the development of a large oblique transverse connection means that the left brachiocephalic vein carries more blood across from the left to the right. The part of the original right precardinal vein between the junction of the two brachiocephalic veins and the azygos veins will give rise to the upper part of the superior vena cava. The caudal part of this vessel, below the entrance of the azygos vein, is formed by the right common cardinal vein. The left precardinal and left common cardinal veins caudal to the transverse branching of the left brachiocephalic vein will disappear; the precardinal vein constitutes the terminal part of the left superior intercostal vein, while the common cardinal vein is represented by the ligament of the left superior vena cava and the oblique vein of the left atrium (vein of Marshall). The remainder of the left superior intercostal vein is developed from the cranial end of the postcardinal vein and drains the second, third and, on occasion, the fourth intercostal veins.

In a four-chamber view of the fetal heart (observed up to about postmenstrual week 28), the following are checked: the heart occupies about one-third of the thorax in the anterior left quadrant of the chest; the two atria are of equal size as are the two ventricles and there is an intact interventricular septum; and the apex of the heart points to the left anterior thorax. In moving images, the ventricles show equal contraction, the two atrioventricular canals open equally and the foramen ovale flap valve can be seen flickering in the left atrium (see Videos 13.2, 23.1). The function and rhythm of the heart is recorded.

Blood flow in this fetal shunt regulates inflow to the right atrium through a constricted aperture that admits umbilical venous blood via a narrow, high velocity flow directly to the foramen ovale. In healthy fetuses the ductus venosus regulates the distribution of placental nutrients and oxygen by restricting the centralization of blood flow, and it can actively dilate in hypoxaemia (<a href="#bib46" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_46">Kaimal 2019</a>).

They narrow as they approach the umbilicus, where there is a reciprocal thickening of the tunica media, reflecting an increase in the number of longitudinal smooth muscle and elastic fibres. The umbilical vessels lack a nerve supply in their extra-abdominal course. Before birth, there is a proliferation of connective tissue within the vessel wall. Within minutes of delivery, blood flow within the umbilical cord vessels decreases and the vessels constrict in response to handling, stretching, cooling and altered tensions of oxygen and carbon dioxide. After the cord is severed, the umbilical arteries constrict, preventing significant blood loss; thrombi often form in the distal ends of the arteries. Full closure of the umbilical vessels is mediated by several factors including prostaglandins, endoperoxides and serotonin. As oxygen tension increases shortly after birth, bradykinin, one of the kinin polypeptide hormones that induce contraction or relaxation of smooth muscle, forms in the blood of the umbilical cord. It is also formed and released by granular leukocytes in the lungs of the neonate after exposure to adequate oxygen. Bradykinin is a potent constrictor of the umbilical arteries and veins, and of the ductus arteriosus, but is also a potent inhibitor of contraction of the pulmonary vessels. The umbilical arteries obliterate from their distal ends until, by the end of postnatal month 2–3, involution has occurred at the level of the superior vesical arteries: the proximal parts of the obliterated vessels remain as the medial umbilical ligaments (see <a href="../B9780702077050000215/B9780702077050000215.xhtml">Ch. 21</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0480"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0390">Umbilical vein</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0780">The umbilical vein in the neonate is 2–3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm long and 4–5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm in diameter when distended.

The tunica media contains smooth muscle fibres, collagen and elastic fibres.</div><div class="text" id="p0785">When the cord is severed, the umbilical vein constricts, but not as vigorously as the arteries. The rapid decrease in pressure in the umbilical vein after the cord is clamped means that the elastic tissue at the umbilical ring is sufficient to arrest any retrograde flow along the vessel. Before birth, there is a subintimal proliferation of connective tissue; after birth, the contraction of the collagen fibres in the tunica media and the increased subintimal connective tissue contribute to the transformation of the vessel into the ligamentum teres hepatis (round ligament of the liver). Obliteration occurs from the umbilical ring towards the hepatic end. No thrombi are formed in the obliteration process. For up to 48 hours after birth, the intra-abdominal portion of the umbilical vein can be easily dilated. In most adults, the original lumen of the vein persists through the ligamentum teres hepatis and can be dilated to 5–6<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm in diameter.</div></section><section><a id="s0485"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0395">Closure of the ductus venosus</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0790">In the fetus, the ductus venosus is a direct continuation of the umbilical vein and arises from the left branch of the portal vein, directly opposite the termination of the umbilical vein.

In the area of transition into the portal sinus, the vessel wall contains circularly arranged smooth muscle fibres, collagen and abundant elastic fibres and its inner surface is ridged. After birth, with the loss of the umbilical blood flow, the blood pressure in the portal sinus drops, the width of the ductus venosus decreases and the inner edges are approximated. The remaining lumen becomes filled with cell-dense connective tissue that occludes the whole vessel. The ductus venosus is already closed in about one-third of neonates, for the remainder it closes between postnatal days 4 and 6, sooner in post-term and macrosomic neonates. Obliteration begins at the portal vein end in the second postnatal week, progresses to the vena cava and is complete by postnatal month 2–3.

At birth, as pulmonary respiration begins, pulmonary blood flow increases dramatically and the left atrium now receives pulmonary venous blood under a relatively high pressure. A decrease in pressure occurs in the inferior vena cava as a result of the reduction of venous return concomitant with occlusion of the umbilical vein and ductus venosus, lowering the right atrial pressure. Left atrial pressure is now greater than that of the right atrium, and the foramen ovale is closed by apposition. Subsequent fusion of the primary septum to the rims of the secondary septum occurs, likely by fibrosis mediated by transition of the endocardium into mesenchyme. Although the foramen ovale closes functionally after pulmonary respiration is established, it does not become structurally closed until later: it is obliterated in fewer than 3% of infants 2 weeks after birth. In adults, fusion is sometimes incomplete, and the foramen remains probe-patent in up to one-third of all individuals. Almost invariably, this lack of fusion has no functional effect because the inequality of atrial pressures and the valve-like arrangement of the opening do not favour right to left shunting of blood.</div><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="231" id="pagebreak_231"/></div></section><section><a id="s0495"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0405">Closure of the ductus arteriosus</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0800">At birth when a neonate takes its first breaths the lungs expand and the pulmonary resistance decreases. Blood flow from the right ventricle now passes along the pulmonary trunk to the lungs and the flow along the ductus arteriosus reverses, flowing from the aorta to the pulmonary trunk. Animal studies have shown that reversal of flow occurs rapidly after ventilation begins. Blood flow from the left ventricle travels via the aorta: the ductus arteriosus contributes almost 50% of total pulmonary blood flow in the neonate. The initial process of ductal closure consists of contraction of the smooth muscle cells and development of sub-endothelial oedema. Initial constriction at birth has been attributed to increased oxygen tension and decrease in prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (<a href="#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Hung et al 2018</a>). Other factors in the closure process include increased plasma catecholamine concentrations; suppression of prostaglandin I2 production; unresponsive prostaglandin E receptors; a synergistic role of prostaglandin F2a and oxygen concentrations; and a decrease in plasma adenosine concentration. The high oxygen tension of the reversed blood flow through the ductus is thought to initiate the synthesis of a hydroperoxy fatty acid that suppresses prostacyclin production, thus exposing the ductus to the contractile effects of prostaglandin endoperoxide. A neural factor may also be involved; the muscular wall has afferent and efferent nerve endings and responds to adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) within 10 minutes of the onset of ventilation; after 2 postnatal hours, the response to adrenaline falls to about 25%. The turbulence and increased shear stress of blood flow through the ductus apparently releases vasoconstrictive factors from the endothelium (<a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Crossley et al 2009</a>).

Definitive closure usually takes 2–3 weeks, but can take up to 3 months before it is considered permanent. Several mechanisms have been implicated as mediators of permanent closure, including intimal cushion formation, proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells, endothelial cell proliferation and production of extracellular matrix (<a href="#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Hung et al 2018</a>). Following functional closure, the ductal smooth muscle cells undergo apoptosis, resulting in fibrosis and the formation of the ligamentum arteriosum that connects the left pulmonary artery (near its origin) to the aortic arch.</div><section><a id="s0500"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0410">Patent ductus arteriosus</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0810">Patent ductus arteriosus can be defined as a failure of the ductus arteriosus to close within 72 hours after birth (<a href="#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_24">Dice and Bhatia 2007</a>). It affects 1 in 2000 live births in the United States and is seen most frequently in preterm neonates and in up to 70% of those born before postmenstrual week 28 (<a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_13">Clyman 2013</a>, <a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Gillam-Krakauer and Reese 2018</a>). Persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus should be distinguished from delayed closure. The persistently patent ductus can be an obligatory part of the circulation when associated with transposition of the great arteries since it allows shunting: the patency may be ensured by appropriate medication. Developmentally, failure to close may be related to reduced intimal thickening, the presence of a thick elastic lamina, low levels of circulating prostaglandins and a low oxygen tension after birth. The condition affects 66% of infants with congenital heart disease born at high altitude (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">Chun et al 2019</a>).

A constriction, the aortic isthmus, is sometimes present in the aorta between the site of origin of the left subclavian artery and the orifice of the ductus arteriosus that can persist as a coarctation of the aorta. This can be found as an isolated lesion, with a normally closed ductus arteriosus.

Neonatal peripheral vessels are particularly small, with delicate walls that can be easily damaged, and consequently their cannulation poses much more of a challenge than is the case with their adult counterparts. Large vessels are in the same relative positions as in the adult but may correspond to different vertebral levels. Thus, although the bifurcation of the common carotid artery into internal and external carotid arteries typically occurs at the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage in both neonate and adult, the thyroid cartilage is relatively higher in the neonatal neck than it is in the adult. The renal arteries also arise at a higher vertebral level in the neonate, often that between the twelfth thoracic and first lumbar vertebrae, whereas they arise at the level of the inferior part of the body of the first lumbar vertebra/upper border of the body of the second lumbar vertebra in the adult. The abdominal aorta bifurcates into common iliac arteries at the upper border of the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra, rather than at the lower border of the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra, as typically occurs in the adult.</div><section><a id="s0515"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0425">Umbilical arterial catheterization</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0825">Insertion of an umbilical catheter is undertaken to provide direct access to the arterial circulation. Arterial blood can be withdrawn repeatedly for measurement of oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressures, pH, base excess and many other parameters of blood biochemistry and haematology. The indwelling catheter also enables the continuous measurement of arterial blood pressure. The catheter is inserted directly into either the cut end or the side of one of the two umbilical arteries in the umbilical cord stump that remains attached to the baby after transection of the umbilical cord at the time of delivery. The catheter tip is then advanced along the length of the umbilical artery, through the internal iliac artery, into the common iliac artery and, from there, into the aorta. In order to keep the catheter patent, a small volume of fluid is continuously infused through it. It is important for the tip of the catheter to be located well away from arteries branching from the aorta, to avoid potentially harmful perfusion of these arteries with the catheter fluid. Thus, umbilical arterial catheter tips are placed in the descending aorta either in a ‘high’ position, above the coeliac trunk but well below the ductus arteriosus, or in a ‘low’ position, below the renal and inferior mesenteric arteries but above the point where the aorta bifurcates into the two common iliac arteries. The length of catheter to be inserted can be estimated from charts relating the required catheter length to external body measurements, or from birth weight. Positioning of the catheter is assessed by means of radiographs of the abdomen or chest: a ‘high’ catheter tip should be located in the descending aorta somewhere between the levels of the sixth and ninth thoracic vertebrae, while a ‘low’ catheter tip should be at a level between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae.

The proximity of the ulnar nerve to the ulnar artery increases the risk of iatrogenic nerve damage associated with cannulation of the ulnar artery, and there is a higher risk of ischaemia with cannulation of this vessel. The relatively poor collateral circulation associated with the dorsalis pedis artery means that this artery is used only as a last resort. The axillary artery is now used in infants with difficult peripheral access; the brachial artery at the antecubital fossa, which was used previously, is rarely used because it has poor collateral circulation and the median nerve is in close proximity.</div><div class="text" id="p0845">Confirmation that an adequate collateral circulation is present when cannulating the radial artery can be obtained by performing Allen’s test (<a href="../B9780702077050000483/B9780702077050000483.xhtml">Ch. 48</a>). Alternatively, intact arterial flow can usually be confirmed, particularly in the preterm infant, by direct visualization of the arteries using trans-illumination. A cold light source is placed on the posterior aspect of the lower forearm and the shadow of the pulsating arteries can be seen on the anterior surface of the forearm.</div></section></section></section></section><footer><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebib0010"/><h2 class="reftitle" id="cesectitle7010">References</h2><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebibsec0010"/><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib1"><!--<a hreef="#bib_1">1</a>. --><a id="ref0055"/><a href="#bib_1">Ahuja</a> P, Sdek P, MacLelolan W.R. <cite>Cardiac myocyte cell cycle control in development, disease and regeneration</cite>. <cite><i>Physiol Rev</i></cite>. 2007;87:521–544.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib2"><!--<a hreef="#bib_2">2</a>. --><a id="ref0060"/><a href="#bib_2">Amore</a> M, Bernardez R, Enriquez R, et al. <cite>Anatomical variations of the thoracic duct: a preliminary report in adult and fetal specimens</cite>. <cite><i>Lymphology</i></cite>. 2016;49:205–209.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib110"><!--<a hreef="#bib_110">110</a>. --><a id="ref0065"/><a href="#bib_110">Anderson</a> R.H, Brown N.A, Webb S. <cite>Development and structure of the atrial septum</cite>. <cite><i>Heart</i></cite>. 2002;88:104–110.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib3"><!--<a hreef="#bib_3">3</a>. --><a id="ref0070"/><a href="#bib_3">Anderson</a> R.H, Jensen B, Mohun T.J, et al. <cite>Key questions relating to left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy: is the emperor still wearing any clothes?</cite> <cite><i>Can J Cardiol</i></cite>. 2017;33:747–757.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib4"><!--<a hreef="#bib_4">4</a>. --><a id="ref0075"/><a href="#bib_4">Anderson</a> R.H, Spicer D.E, Mori S. <cite>Of tracts, rings, nodes, cusps, sinuses, and arrhythmias</cite>. <cite><i>J Cardiovasc Dev Dis</i></cite>. 2016;3(2):E17. doi: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcdd3020017">10.3390/jcdd3020017</a> pii.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib5"><!--<a hreef="#bib_5">5</a>. --><a id="ref0080"/><a href="#bib_5">Baron</a> M.H. <cite>Early embryonic erythropoiesis ….
