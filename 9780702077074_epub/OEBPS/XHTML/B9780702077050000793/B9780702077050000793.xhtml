The skin covering the ankle and foot is highly innervated and clinically important. Retinacula hold the flexor and extensor muscle tendons in place during contraction. The plantar aponeurosis protects the plantar aspect of the foot and is associated with specialized fat pads. The distal tibia and fibula along with the talus form the ankle joint. The talus rests on the largest tarsal, the calcaneus, which receives the calcaneal (Achilles) tendon. The remaining tarsals are the navicular, three cuneiforms, and the cuboid. Accessory bones may be present. The five metatarsals connect some tarsals to the phalanges. Variation exists in the number and position of the sesamoid bones. The medial collateral (deltoid) and lateral collateral ligaments stabilize the ankle joint. Other ligaments maintain stability and contribute to the arches of the foot. The intrinsic foot muscles are organized into five layers. Recent advances in MRI technology allow many of the aforementioned structures to be visualized in exquisite detail. The toenails have great clinical relevance because they are commonly affected by diverse pathologies.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">Achilles; ankle; bones; calcaneus; deltoid ligament; foot; plantar; radiograph; talus; talocrural joint</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The ankle joint (talocrural joint) is a diarthrodial articulation involving the distal tibia and fibula and the body of the talus; it is the only example in the human body of a true mortise joint. The human foot is a complex structure adapted to allow orthograde bipedal stance and locomotion and is the only part of the body that is in regular contact with the ground (<a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793_split_a.xhtml#bib48" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_58">Jones 1949</a>). There are 28 separate bones in the human foot, including the sesamoid bones of the first metatarsophalangeal joint, and 31 joints, including the ankle joint. The hindfoot comprises the calcaneus and talus; the midfoot comprises the navicular, cuboid and three cuneiforms; the forefoot comprises five metatarsals, 14 phalanges and two sesamoid bones. With regard to the nomenclature of the surfaces of the foot, the terms ‘plantar’ and ‘dorsal’ are used to denote inferior and superior surfaces, respectively.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><hgroup><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Skin and Soft Tissues</h2><h3 class="h2after1" id="cesectitle0025">Skin</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0030">Vascular supply and lymphatic drainage</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0015"/><section><a id="s0020"/><div class="textfl" id="p0015">The skin around the ankle is supplied by anterior lateral and anterior medial malleolar arteries from the anterior tibial artery, posterior medial malleolar branches from the posterior tibial artery, posterior lateral malleolar branches from the fibular artery, and fasciocutaneous perforators from the anterior and posterior tibial and fibular arteries. The main blood supply to the medial side of the heel is from the medial calcaneal branches of the posterior tibial artery or, sometimes, the lateral plantar artery passing through the flexor retinaculum (<a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793_split_a.xhtml#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">Attinger et al 1997</a>). The skin of the lateral side of the heel is supplied by lateral calcaneal branches of the fibular artery and the lateral tarsal artery. The arterial supply to the skin of the foot is rich and is derived from branches of the dorsalis pedis (the direct continuation of the anterior tibial artery), posterior tibial and fibular arteries. The skin covering the dorsum of the foot is supplied by the dorsalis pedis artery and by its continuation, the first dorsal metatarsal artery, with smaller contributions from the anterior perforating branch of the fibular artery and the marginal anastomotic arteries on the medial and lateral borders of the foot. The skin covering the plantar surface of the foot is supplied by perforating branches of the medial and lateral plantar arteries (the terminal branches of the posterior tibial artery). The skin of the forefoot is supplied by cutaneous branches of the common digital arteries.</div><div class="text" id="p0020">Cutaneous venous drainage is via dorsal and plantar venous arches draining into medial and lateral marginal veins. The medial and lateral marginal veins form the long (great) and short (small) saphenous veins, respectively. On the plantar aspect of the foot, a superficial venous network forms an intradermal and subdermal mesh that drains to the medial and lateral marginal veins. Venous branches that accompany the medial and lateral plantar arteries arise from a deep venous network. Uniquely within the lower limb, venous flow in the foot is bidirectional. However, when valves are present, flow is from the plantar to the superficial dorsal system. From here, blood leaves the foot in the superficial and deep veins of the lower limb.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">Superficial lymphatic drainage of all areas of the leg and foot (except the superficial posterolateral area) is via lymphatic vessels that accompany the long saphenous vein and its tributaries. The superficial posterolateral foot and leg drain into the popliteal lymph nodes via lymphatic vessels that accompany the short saphenous vein. Deep lymphatic vessels that accompany the dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial and fibular arteries drain into the popliteal lymph nodes.</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0035">Innervation</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0030">The skin covering the ankle and foot is innervated by nerves derived from the fourth and fifth lumbar and first sacral spinal nerves (see <a href="../B9780702077050000768/B9780702077050000768.xhtml#f0060">Figs 76.12</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000768/B9780702077050000768.xhtml#f0070">76.14</a>). Innervation of the dorsum of the foot is provided medially by the saphenous nerve, centrally by the superficial fibular nerve and laterally by the sural nerve; the deep fibular nerve supplies the dorsum of the first web space. Dorsal branches of the medial and lateral plantar nerves innervate the nail beds. The plantar aspect of the foot is innervated by the medial and lateral plantar nerves, which arise as terminal branches of the tibial nerve. The medial plantar nerve supplies sensation to the plantar aspect of the great toe and the second, the third and the medial half of the fourth toes. The lateral plantar nerve supplies the remaining lateral aspect of the fourth and the entire fifth toe. The heel is innervated by calcaneal branches of the tibial and sural nerves. Injury to any of these nerves can lead to painful neuromas and loss of protective sensation, the latter is a common complication in diabetic neuropathy, which is one of the major risk factors in developing diabetic foot ulcers.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0030"/><section><a id="s0035"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0040">Nail apparatus</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0035">A toenail consists of a nail plate with the underlying nail matrix and nail bed.

Blood enters the compartment at arterial pressure, but with no outflow, this increases compartment pressures until they exceed the arterial pressure. At this point the inflow of arterial blood ceases, leading to muscle and nerve ischaemia. Failure to relieve the increased pressure in the compartment surgically results in necrosis of the soft tissues within the compartment.

(The ‘tarsal canal’ is the term that is commonly used to describe the tunnel-shaped medial end of the tarsal sinus.) Branches from the arterial network in the tarsal canal enter the talus. The artery continues through the tarsal canal into the lateral part of the tarsal sinus, where it anastomoses with the artery of the tarsal sinus, forming a vascular sling under the talar neck. A branch of the artery of the tarsal canal known as the deltoid branch passes deep to the deltoid ligament and supplies part of the medial aspect of the talar body. Sometimes, it arises from the posterior tibial <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1436" id="pagebreak_1436"/><a id="pg1436"/>artery; rarely, it arises from the medial plantar artery; it may be the only remaining arterial supply to the talus when this bone is fractured. The dorsalis pedis artery supplies branches to the superior aspect of the talar neck and also gives off the artery of the tarsal sinus.

The lower end of the tibia and its medial malleolus, together with the lateral malleolus of the fibula and inferior transverse tibiofibular ligament, form a deep recess (‘mortise’) for the body of the talus. Although it appears to be a simple hinge, its axis of rotation is dynamic, shifting during dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. Starting from the plantigrade position, the normal range of dorsiflexion is 10° when the knee is straight, and 30° with the knee flexed (when the calcaneal tendon will be relaxed). The range of normal plantar flexion is 30°. (The values of these ranges are all approximate.) Dorsiflexion results in the joint adopting the ‘close-packed’ position, with maximal congruence and ligamentous tension; from this position, all major thrusting movements are exerted, in walking, running and jumping. The malleoli grip the talus, and no appreciable lateral movement can occur without stretch of the inferior tibiofibular syndesmosis, even in relaxation. The superior talar surface is broader in front, and in dorsiflexion, the malleolar gap is increased by slight lateral rotation of the fibula, by ‘give’ at the inferior tibiofibular syndesmosis, and gliding at the superior tibiofibular joint. Normal ankles show valgus inclination at birth. The morphology changes in the first few years of life and the ankle reaches the adult position by the age of three years (<a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793_split_a.xhtml#bib79" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_79">Nakai et al 2000</a>).</div><section><a id="s0880"/><section><a id="s0885"/><section><a id="s0890"/><section><a id="s0895"/><section><a id="s0900"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0515">Articulating surfaces</p><div class="textfl" id="p0655">Articular surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage.

Because of the varying slope of the lateral surface of the body of the talus, the fibula undergoes a small degree of lateral rotation during dorsiflexion at the ankle, and this results in slight widening of the interval between the bones. Testing for a significant disruption of this joint is usually carried out with the patient under anaesthesia and involves applying a lateral rotation and abduction force, looking for abnormal widening of the syndesmosis. Another helpful clinical test for evaluating a syndesmotic injury is the Hopkinson squeeze test. This test is carried out by compressing the fibula to the tibia at the midpoint of the leg. An injured syndesmosis will result in pain in the area of the inferior tibiofibular joint (<a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793_split_a.xhtml#bib54" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_54">Hopkinson et al 1990</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793_split_a.xhtml#bib998" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_998">Scheyerer et al 2011</a>).

Footwear is implicated in this condition, which presumably accounts for the greater incidence in females. This is because high heel shoes can hold the foot in an artificially supinated position, and the pointed toe box of the shoes can compress the toes towards the midline. However, it is more of an accelerating factor than a sole causative one. Hallux abducto valgus is a tri-planar deformity, and is associated with transverse abduction (from the midline of the foot), sagittal elevation and frontal plane rotation of the first metatarsal, which abducts and rotates the hallux in valgus (<a href="#f0150"><span class="bold">Fig. 79.20</span></a>). While frontal plane rotation is a prevalent part of hallux abducto valgus, it is rarely considered in surgical correction, which may account for the high recurrence rates of this deformity (<a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793_split_a.xhtml#bib51" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_51">Hatch et al 2018</a>).</div><div id="p1245"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f2001"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000793/main.assets/on79-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap2002"/><a id="fspara2003"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 79.20</span> Radiograph of the left foot of a skeletally mature adult with a hallux abducto valgus (bunion) deformity.</figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="text" id="p1250">The more spheroidal the shape of the first metatarsal head, the more likely it is to be unstable.

Furthermore, the base of the first metatarsal (the first metatarsal cuneiform joint) has no ligamentous attachments to the lateral four metatarsals. This creates an intrinsic instability that can more easily allow the first metatarsal to drift (<a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793_split_a.xhtml#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_19">Burns and Mecham 2014</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1255">As the proximal phalanx moves laterally on the metatarsal head, it pushes the head medially. This leads to attenuation of the medial soft tissue structures and contracture of the lateral ones. The extensor tendon axis, once midline, becomes a deforming force as the metatarsophalangeal joint is positioned medial to the tendon. The sesamoid sling (i.e. plantar plate and flexor hallucis brevis), which is anchored laterally by adductor hallucis, remains in place as the head moves medially and everts, giving the illusion on a radiograph of displacing the sesamoid bones from beneath the metatarsal head. In reality, the sesamoids stay locked in the sling, and it is the metatarsal head that is displaced and may play a role in the increased size of the medial eminence (the visible medial protuberance of a bunion deformity) as the deformity progresses into late stage changes (<a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793_split_a.xhtml#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Burns and Mecham 2014</a>). As this happens, the weakest point of the medial capsule fails, so that abductor hallucis slips under the metatarsal head. This leads to failure of the intrinsic muscles to stabilize the joint, and the pull of abductor hallucis leads to spinning of the proximal phalanx, which results in a varus deformity. Failure to intervene surgically inevitably results in a progressive deformity.</div></section></section></section></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s2000"/><section><a id="s2005"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle1080">Interphalangeal joints</h3><div class="textfl" id="p1260">Interphalangeal articulations are almost pure hinge joints in which the trochlear surfaces on the phalangeal heads articulate with reciprocally curved surfaces on adjacent phalangeal bases.

It is made up of the calcaneus, talar head, navicular, the three cuneiforms and the medial three metatarsals. The posterior and anterior pillars are the posterior part of the inferior calcaneal surface and the three metatarsal heads, respectively. The bones themselves contribute little to the stability of the arch, whereas the ligaments contribute significantly. The most important ligamentous structure is the plantar aponeurosis, which acts as a tie beam between the supporting pillars (<a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793_split_a.xhtml#bib53" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_53">Hicks 1954</a>). Dorsiflexion, especially of the great toe, draws the two pillars together, thus heightening the arch: the so-called ‘windlass’ mechanism. Next in importance is the spring ligament, which supports the head of the talus. If this ligament attenuates, the navicular and calcaneus separate, allowing the talar head, the highest point of the arch, to descend, leading to a flat-foot deformity. The talocalcaneal ligaments and the anterior fibres of the deltoid ligament, from the tibia to the navicular, also contribute to the stability of the arch. Muscles play a role in the maintenance of the medial longitudinal arch. Flexor hallucis longus acts as a bowstring. Flexor digitorum longus, abductor hallucis and the medial half of flexor digitorum brevis also contribute but to a lesser extent. Tibialis posterior and anterior invert and adduct the foot, and so help to raise its medial border. The importance of tibialis posterior is manifest by the collapse of the medial longitudinal arch that accompanies failure of its tendon (see below, pes planus).</div></section><section><a id="s2065"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle1115">Lateral longitudinal arch</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1295">The lateral longitudinal arch is a much less pronounced arch than the medial one. The bones making up the lateral longitudinal arch are the calcaneus, the cuboid and the fourth and fifth metatarsals; they contribute little to the arch in terms of stability (see <a href="#f0045">Fig. 79.9A</a>). The pillars are the calcaneus posteriorly and the lateral two metatarsal heads anteriorly. Ligaments play a more important role in stabilizing the arch, especially the lateral part of the plantar aponeurosis and the long and short plantar ligaments. However, the tendon of fibularis longus makes the most important contribution to the maintenance of the lateral arch. The lateral two tendons of flexor digitorum longus (and flexor accessorius), the muscles of the first layer (lateral half of flexor digitorum brevis and abductor digiti minimi), and fibularis brevis and tertius also contribute to the maintenance of the lateral longitudinal arch.</div></section><section><a id="s2070"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle1120">Transverse arch</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1300">The bones involved in the transverse arch are the bases of the five metatarsals, the cuboid and the cuneiforms (see <a href="#f0045">Fig. 79.9A</a>). The intermediate and lateral cuneiforms are wedge-shaped and thus adapted to maintenance of the transverse arch. The ligaments, which bind the cuneiforms and the metatarsal bases, mainly provide the stability of the arch, as does the tendon of fibularis longus, which tends to approximate the medial and lateral borders of the foot. A shallow arch is maintained at the metatarsal heads by the deep transverse ligaments, transverse fibres that tie together the digital slips of the plantar aponeurosis, and, to a lesser extent, by the transverse head of adductor hallucis.</div></section><section><a id="s2075"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle1125">Pes planus and pes cavus</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1305">The term pes planus denotes an excessively flat foot. There is no precise degree of flatness that defines pes planus but it may be either physiological or pathological. In physiological pes planus, the feet are flexible and rarely problematic. There is a high prevalence in children of preschool age. In the 2–6 years age group, normal arch volumes in the sitting and standing positions correlate with the height of the navicular (lowest palpable medial projection of the navicular to the floor) (<a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793_split_a.xhtml#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Chang et al 2012</a>). In marked contrast, pathological pes planus is often associated with stiffness and pain. The windlass (or ‘Jack’s great toe’) test involves passively dorsiflexing the great toe at the metatarsophalangeal joint. This tightens the plantar aponeurosis and, in flexible pes planus, results in accentuation of the medial longitudinal arch. In pathological pes planus, no accentuation of the arch is seen. Another test can also be carried out by asking the individual to stand with both feet plantar flexed while viewing the hindfoot from behind. In flexible flat feet, the calcaneus swings into a varus position; in pathological pes planus it does not. Abduction of the forefoot associated with pes planus causes most of the lesser digits to be visible from this view (‘too many toes sign’). Causes of pathological pes planus include tarsal coalition, disruption of the tendon of tibialis posterior, rupture of the spring ligament, tarsometatarsal arthritis (and subsequent collapse), and hindfoot (talocalcaneal or subtalar joint) degenerative or inflammatory arthritis.</div><div class="text" id="p1310">Pes cavus denotes an excessively high-arched foot. The majority of cases arise as a result of a neurological disorder (e.g. Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, tethered spinal cord, poliomyelitis). According to the anatomical location of the deformity, pes cavus may be classified into hindfoot, midfoot or forefoot cavus. When pes cavus involves all three parts of the foot, it is called ‘global’ cavus. In Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, an overactive fibularis longus leads <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1455" id="pagebreak_1455"/><a id="pg1455"/>to plantar hyperflexion of the first metatarsal. To keep the forefoot in contact with the ground, the patient develops a progressive compensatory hindfoot varus. If ignored, the hindfoot varus, which is initially flexible, becomes fixed. Charcot foot deformity, a relatively rare arthropathy that presents in conjunction with peripheral neuropathy, but separate from Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, often leads to a total collapse of the midfoot. This creates a pathological flatfoot that can progress to a ‘rocker-bottom deformity’ as the downward pressure from the leg acts in concert with the upward pull of the calcaneal (Achilles) tendon. As a corrective measure for this, the calcaneal tendon is often lengthened surgically (<a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793_split_a.xhtml#bib90" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_90">Ramanujam and Zgonis 2017</a>).</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s2080"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle1130">Muscles</h2><div class="textfl" id="p1315">The muscles acting on the foot may be divided into extrinsic and intrinsic groups.</div><section><a id="s2085"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle1135">Extrinsic muscles</h3><div class="textfl" id="p1320">The extrinsic muscles are described in <a href="../B9780702077050000781/B9780702077050000781.xhtml#c0078">Chapter 78</a>.

The vascularity of the skin overlying the calcaneal tendon varies according to location: the skin on the medial side of the tendon is supplied by the posterior tibial artery and on the lateral side by the fibular artery (<a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793_split_a.xhtml#bib110" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_110">Yepes et al 2010</a>).

As the gastrocnemius–soleus complex is squeezed, a lack of movement at the ankle indicates a complete rupture of the tendon (positive test result). However, this lack of motion is dependent upon the rupture of soleus compared to the aponeurosis of gastrocnemius, and can sometimes result in a false positive (<a href="../B9780702077050000793/B9780702077050000793_split_a.xhtml#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Douglas et al 2009</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s2130"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle1175">Relations</p><div class="textfl" id="p1365">The calcaneal tendon is subcutaneous.

Dorsiflexion of the ankle results in compression of the bursa. A prominent superolateral calcaneal tuberosity, often associated with a retrocalcaneal bursa, may impinge on the deep aspect of the calcaneal tendon where it is inserted onto the calcaneus (Haglund’s disease). Symptoms are exacerbated by dorsiflexion of the ankle because this movement increases the pressure within the bursa and causes impingement of the calcaneus against the insertion of the tendon.

Tarsal tunnel syndrome is much less common than carpal tunnel syndrome. The flexor retinaculum may compress the tibial nerve or either of its branches (medial and lateral plantar nerves); entrapment at this level is most commonly due to a space-occupying lesion, e.g. a ganglion, or to compression by either a leash of vessels or the deep fascia associated with abductor hallucis. Compression of the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve (Baxter’s nerve) by the deep fascia that covers abductor hallucis has been implicated as a possible cause of chronic heel pain and of plantar fasciopathy. (Plantar fasciopathy, often caused by repetitive high-impact injury to the foot, may be associated with pain, especially over the medial calcaneal process, which may be exacerbated by passive ankle or great toe flexion.) The medial plantar nerve can be compressed at the ‘knot of Henry’, which is the point where the tendon of flexor hallucis longus crosses deep to the tendon of flexor digitorum longus, to reach its medial side in the sole of the foot. The superficial fibular nerve can be damaged in severe inversion injuries of the ankle, and the deep fibular nerve is sometimes compressed by osteophytes in the region of the second tarsometatarsal joint. Sural nerve entrapment is usually not due to compression by fascial elements. Entrapment of the third common digital nerve as it passes deep to the intermetatarsal ligament of the third (or less commonly the second) web space can result in a Morton’s neuroma, which is probably the most common form of nerve entrapment in the foot.</div><div class="text" id="p1810">Patients with Morton’s neuroma usually present with a main complaint of pain in the area of the third and fourth metatarsal heads, and tingling, shooting pain, or numbness over the lateral aspect of the third <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1463" id="pagebreak_1463"/><a id="pg1463"/>and medial aspect of the fourth digits.

Plantar flexion and dorsiflexion refer to movement in the sagittal plane and occur principally, but not exclusively, at the ankle, metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. Motion along the frontal or coronal plane involves inversion, which is a tilting of the plantar surface of the foot towards the midline, and eversion, a tilting away from the midline. These movements take place principally in the talocalcaneal and transverse tarsal joints. Adduction is movement of the foot towards the midline in the transverse plane; abduction is movement away from the midline in the transverse plane. These movements occur in the transverse tarsal joints and, to a limited degree, in the first tarsometatarsal and metatarsophalangeal joints.</div><div class="text" id="p1820">Supination describes a tri-planar motion, and is a combination of adduction, inversion and plantar flexion. Pronation is the opposite tri-planar motion, i.e. a combination of abduction, eversion and dorsiflexion. Pronation and supination are usually better terms than eversion and inversion, because the latter rarely occur in isolation and the former describe the ‘compound’ motion that usually occurs.</div><div class="text" id="p1825">Active movements occur at the ankle, talocalcaneonavicular and subtalar joints. Movements at the ankle joint are almost entirely restricted to dorsiflexion and plantar flexion, but slight rotation may occur in plantar flexion.

To fulfil the first function, the pedal platform must be able to spread the stresses of standing and moving, and be pliable enough to accommodate walking or running over uneven and sloping surfaces. To fulfil the second function, the foot must be transformable into a strong, adjustable lever in order to resist inertia and powerful thrust; a segmented lever can best meet such stresses if it is arched.</div><div class="text" id="p1840">In infants and young children, fatty connective tissue on the plantar aspect may give the foot a flat appearance and soft tissues modify its appearance to varying degrees at all ages.

However, the skeleton of the human foot is normally arched, and the sole of the foot is usually visibly concave. These arches vary individually in their height, especially the medial part of the longitudinal arch. Since they are dynamic, their heights also differ in different phases of activity.</div><div class="text" id="p1845">The medial longitudinal arch contains the calcaneus, talus, navicular, cuneiform and medial three metatarsals. Its summit, at the superior talar articular surface, takes the full thrust from the tibia and passes it backwards to the calcaneus, and forwards through the navicular and cuneiforms to the metatarsals. When the foot is grounded, these forces are transmitted through the three metatarsal heads and calcaneus (especially its tuberosity). The medial arch is higher, and more mobile and resilient than the lateral arch, and its flattening progressively tightens the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament and plantar aponeurosis. The lateral arch is adapted to transmit weight and thrust rather than to absorb such forces; the long plantar and plantar calcaneocuboid ligaments tighten as it flattens.</div><div class="text" id="p1850">The lateral arch makes contact with the ground more extensively than the medial arch. As the foot flattens, an increasing fraction of load traverses the soft tissues that are inferior to the entire arch. The whole lateral border usually touches the ground, whereas the medial border does not. The medial border is visibly concave, usually even in standing, which explains the familiar outline of human footprints (although this varies with the position of the feet, the development of associated soft tissues and the nature of the surface) (<a href="#f0130"><span class="bold">Fig. 79.28</span></a>). In any activity, as soon as the heel rises, the toes are extended and muscular structures (including the plantar aponeurosis) tighten up in the sole, accentuating the longitudinal arches: it has been suggested that tension diminishes in the deeper plantar ligaments in this phase. The sole is transversely concave, both in skeletal form and usually in external appearance; serial transverse arches are most developed inferior to the metatarsus and adjoining tarsus. <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1464" id="pagebreak_1464"/><a id="pg1464"/>Transmission of force occurs at the metatarsal heads, to some degree along the lateral border of the foot, and through subjacent soft tissues.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0130"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000793/main.assets/f79-26-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0130"/><a id="fspara0130"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 79.28</span> The concept of the foot skeleton as a twisted plate that may be untwisted (supination) or further twisted (pronation) during the maintenance of a plantigrade stance in various positions of the foot. <span class="bold">A</span>, The foot skeleton in supination, as in standing with the feet widely separated.

If the longitudinal arches are allowed to sink as a result of muscular relaxation, the plantar ligaments support the bones in an arched form. The medial arch is more elevated when the feet are together than when they are apart, i.e. inversion with supination increases as the feet are separated. This medial sag can be countered by voluntary contraction of muscles such as tibialis anterior. Whatever the position of the feet, pronation and supination ensure that in standing, a maximal weight-bearing area is grounded from the metatarsal heads along the lateral border of the foot to the calcaneus. The twist of the ligamentous skeleton of the foot imparted by pronation (which is partly undone in supination) prompts the likening of the foot to a twisted but resilient plate (see <a href="#f0130">Fig. 79.28</a>), where adequate ground contact is ensured whatever the angle between the foot and leg, and adaptable resilience is imparted in standing and progression.</div></section></section></section>
