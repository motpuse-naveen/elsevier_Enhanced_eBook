These structures play critical roles in basic trunk motion, physiological processes (e.g. cough and Valsalva functions) and provide support and protection for the peritoneal and retroperitoneal organs of the abdomen. Operations on any of these organs, which are among the most common interventional procedures performed, generally require access through the layers of the abdominal wall. Despite these critical functions and the commonality of operations on the anterior abdominal wall, the normal, variant, abnormal and post-surgical anatomy are often misunderstood in form and function. Such misunderstandings can lead to incorrect diagnoses, defunctionalization as a result of trauma to the innervation or muscle layers and devascularization leading to necrosis. This chapter reviews the anatomy of the anterior abdominal wall and the inguinal canal with particular emphasis on myofascial anatomy and hernias that can arise as a result of anterior abdominal wall defects.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">abdominal wall; component separation; external oblique muscle; hernia; inguinal canal; internal oblique muscle; peritoneum; pyramidalis muscle; rectus muscle; transversus abdominis muscle</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The anterior abdominal wall constitutes a curved hexagonal area defined superiorly by the costal arches (margins) and xiphisternal junction, laterally by the mid-axillary line, and inferiorly by an imaginary line running along the iliac crests, inguinal ligament and pubic symphysis. It is continuous with the posterior abdominal wall and paravertebral tissues, forming a flexible sheet of skin, muscle and connective tissue across the anterior and lateral aspects of the abdomen. It is also contiguous with the respiratory diaphragm and with the bony and myofascial structures of the thorax. These tissues form the complex structures of the myopectineal orifice and the inguinal canal, which connect the peritoneal cavity to the scrotum in males or to the labia majora in females. The anterior abdominal wall maintains the shape of the abdomen and aids in numerous physiological functions. However, its dysfunction is equally notable, as hernia repair remains the single most common type of operation performed by general surgeons.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Skin and Soft Tissue</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0015">The integument of the anterior abdominal wall comprises skin, soft tissues, lymphatic and vascular structures, and segmental nerves. The outer layer is formed from the skin and subcutaneous fat. The skin is non-specialized and variably hirsute, depending on sex and ancestry. All postpubertal individuals have some extension of the pubic hair on to the skin of the anterior abdominal wall, though this is commonly most pronounced in males, where the hair can extend to the umbilicus in a triangular pattern. The subcutaneous fat of the abdominal wall is highly variable in thickness, depending in part on sex and caloric intake.</div><section><a id="s0015"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0025">Soft tissue</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0030">Superficial fascia</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0020"/><div class="textfl" id="p0020">The superficial fascia of the abdominal wall lies between the dermis and the muscles, and is conventionally divided into a superficial fatty layer (Camper’s fascia) and a membranous layer (Scarpa’s fascia) deeper to this. In reality there are three layers, with a further layer of adipose tissue deep to the membranous layer (i.e. deep fatty layer) (<a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_31">Lancerotto et al 2011</a>). These three layers are particularly well defined in the child; the membranous layer remains well defined in adults. Lying within the superficial fascial planes are adipose tissue, blood vessels, lymphatics, nerves and, in the inguinal region, superficial inguinal nodes.</div><section><a id="s0025"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0035">Superficial fatty layer</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0025">The superficial fatty layer contains a variable amount of fat that is partitioned by fibrous septa connecting the dermis with the deeper membranous layer. Inferiorly it is continuous with the superficial fascia of the thigh, and medially it is continuous over the linea alba. In males this layer continues over the external genitalia, where it becomes thin and pale red and contains very little adipose tissue. In the scrotum it also contains the smooth muscle fibres of dartos. In females it continues from the hypogastric region of the abdomen into the labia majora and perineum.</div></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0040">Membranous layer</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0030">The membranous layer is a variably developed entity composed of connective tissue and elastic fibres. In the adult its thickness varies over the anterior abdominal wall, becoming thinner in the proximal abdomen (<a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Lancerotto et al 2011</a>). Measured histologically, it is between 0.5 and 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm thick but it appears thicker on computed tomography (<a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Chopra et al 2011</a>, <a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Lancerotto et al 2011</a>). It is loosely connected to the underlying aponeurosis of external abdominal oblique and the rectus sheath by oblique fibrous septa. Superiorly, it is continuous with the superficial fascia over the remainder of the trunk. In the midline it is adherent to the linea alba and pubic symphysis. Inferiorly, it fuses with the iliac crest, and extends superficial to the inguinal ligament and fuses with the fascia lata at the inguinal crease. In males it extends onto the dorsum of the penis, forming the fundiform ligament of the penis, and onto the scrotum where it becomes continuous with the membranous layer of the superficial fascia of the perineum (Colles’ fascia). In females it continues into the labia majora and is continuous with the superficial fascia of the perineum.</div><div class="text" id="p0035">In boys the testis can frequently be retracted out of the scrotum into the loose areolar tissue between the membranous layer of superficial fascia over the inguinal canal and the aponeurosis of external abdominal oblique.</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0045">Deep fatty layer</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0040">The thickness of the deep fatty layer is more variable than the superficial fatty layer. It is thin or absent where the membranous layer fuses with bony prominences and the linea alba, and can become markedly thick in some morbidly obese individuals. Its adipocytes show different metabolic activities from those in the superficial fatty layer (<a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Chopra et al 2011</a>). Liposuction preferentially removes this layer of fat with relative preservation of the superficial fatty layer in order to avoid skin dimpling and other skin contour irregularities (<a href="#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_38">Markman and Barton 1987</a>).</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0040"/><section><a id="s0045"/><section><a id="s0050"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0050">Transversalis fascia</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0045">The transversalis fascia is a thin layer of connective tissue lying between the deep surface of transversus abdominis and the extraperitoneal fat. It is part of the general layer of thin fascia between the peritoneum and the abdominal wall. Posteriorly, it fuses with the anterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia; anteriorly, it forms a continuous sheet. Superiorly, it blends with the fascia covering the inferior surface of respiratory diaphragm. Inferiorly, it is continuous with the iliac and pelvic parietal fasciae. It is attached to the iliac crest between the origins of transversus abdominis and iliacus, and to the posterior margin of the inguinal ligament as a discrete thickening known as the iliopubic tract (<a href="#bib60" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_60">Teoh et al 1999</a>); it consists of transverse fibres that fan out laterally towards the anterior superior iliac spine to blend with the iliopsoas fascia and run medially to the pubic bone. The iliopubic tract is a landmark structure during laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, although it is often incorrectly described as the inguinal ligament. Medial to the femoral sheath the transveralis fascia is fused to the pubis behind the conjoint aponeurosis (conjoint ‘tendon’). An inferior extension of the fascia forms the anterior part of the femoral sheath. A further thickening of the transversalis fascia, the interfoveolar ligament, runs inferior to the inguinal ligament at the medial margin of the deep inguinal ring; it may contain muscle fibres.</div><div class="text" id="p0050">The transversalis fascia continues as the internal spermatic fascia over the structures that pass through the deep inguinal ring (the testicular vessels and ductus deferens in males and the round ligament of the uterus in females).</div></section><section><a id="s0055"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0055">Extraperitoneal connective tissue</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0055">The extraperitoneal connective tissue lying between the peritoneum and the fasciae lining the abdominal and pelvic cavities contains a variable amount of fat. This adipose tissue is the most common content of small congenital umbilical and epigastric hernias (see below). The fat is especially abundant on the posterior wall of the abdomen around the kidneys but scanty proximal to the iliac crest and in much of the pelvis. The inferior epigastric vessels themselves are contained within an envelope of fat as they travel from the external iliac vessels to rectus abdominis. This fat pad serves as an anatomical landmark during various types of abdominal hernia repairs. An abundance of fat in the extraperitoneal space also enables a peritoneal flap to be created easily: such a flap can be used to cover mesh during hernia surgery (a so-called extraperitoneal or ‘pre-peritoneal’ hernia repair). Areas with little fat, where the peritoneum and transversalis fascia are in direct contact with one another, are difficult to separate, commonly resulting in rents in the peritoneum that must be carefully repaired.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1123" id="pagebreak_1123"/><a id="pg1123"/></div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0060"/><section><a id="s0065"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0060">Vascular supply and lymphatic drainage</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0060">Understanding the blood supply of the anterior abdominal wall is critical when planning incisions, creating lipocutaneous or myofascial flaps or reconstructing the abdominal wall during ventral hernia repair (<a href="#f0080"><span class="bold">Fig. 60.1</span></a>).</div><div id="p0070"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0080"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000604/main.assets/on60-01a-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000604/main.assets/on60-01b-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0080"/><a id="cap0085"/><a id="fspara0085"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 60.1</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, The blood supply of the anterior abdominal wall.

Superiorly, it receives blood supply from the superior epigastric artery, a branch of the internal thoracic artery. Inferiorly it is supplied by the inferior epigastric artery, a branch of the external iliac artery. As the superior and inferior epigastric arteries run posterior to rectus abdominis they supply musculocutaneous perforating vessels (the so-called periumbilical perforator vessels) to the overlying tissues. The superior and inferior epigastric arteries converge in the proximal umbilical region. <span class="bold">Zone 2</span> encompasses the hypogastric region distal to the arcuate line (semicircular line of Douglas). The area is supplied medially by superficial and deep branches of the inferior epigastric artery.

It arises at the level of the sixth costal cartilage and descends between the costal and sternal parts of the diaphragm, accompanied by two or more veins that drain to the internal thoracic vein (see <a href="#f0080">Fig. 60.1</a>; <a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 60.2</span></a>). The vessels pass anterior to the distal fibres of transversus thoracis and the proximal fibres of transversus abdominis before entering the rectus sheath, where they run inferiorly behind rectus abdominis. They anastomose with the inferior epigastric arteries within rectus abdominis in one of several potential branching patterns (<a href="#bib52" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_52">Rozen et al 2008</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000604/main.assets/f60-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 60.2</span> The muscles and arterial supply of the anterolateral abdominal wall.

A branch given off in the proximal rectus sheath passes anterior to the xiphoid process of the sternum and anastomoses with a corresponding contralateral branch. This vessel can give rise to bleeding during surgical incisions that extend up to and alongside the xiphoid process. The superior epigastric artery also gives small branches to the anterior part of the diaphragm. On the right, small branches reach the falciform ligament, where they anastomose with branches from the hepatic artery.</div></section><section><a id="s0075"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0070">Inferior epigastric artery and veins</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0085">The inferior epigastric artery (often referred to as the deep inferior epigastric artery in clinical practice in order to distinguish it from the superficial (inferior) epigastric artery) originates from the medial aspect of the external iliac artery just proximal to where the vessels pass deep to the inguinal ligament (see <a href="#f0080">Figs 60.1</a>–<a href="#f0010">60.2</a>; <a href="#f0090"><span class="bold">Fig. 60.3</span></a>). Its accompanying veins, usually two, unite to form a single vein that drains into the external iliac vein (<a href="#bib53" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_53">Rozen et al 2009</a>). The vessel curves forwards in the extraperitoneal tissue and ascends obliquely along the medial margin of the deep inguinal ring. It lies posterior to the spermatic cord, separated from it by the transversalis fascia. It pierces the transversalis fascia and enters the posterior layer of the rectus sheath by passing anterior to the arcuate line. <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1124" id="pagebreak_1124"/>In this part of its course it is visible through the parietal peritoneum of the anterior abdominal wall and with this covering forms the lateral umbilical fold.

Branching into two vessels before anastomosing is the most common pattern, accounting for almost 60%, with a trifurcation in the remainder. The inferior epigastric arteries have an average diameter of approximately 3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm at their origin, compared to an average diameter of 1.6<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm at the origin of the superior epigastric arteries, presumably explaining why the inferior epigastric arteries provide the ‘dominant’ blood supply to rectus abdominis. Preliminary ligation of the inferior epigastric artery is often performed when preparing a myocutaneous flap from the mid or lower rectus abdominis based on the superior epigastric artery; this encourages augmentation of the superior epigastric arterial supply.</div><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1125" id="pagebreak_1125"/></div><div class="text" id="p0130">Branches of the inferior epigastric artery anastomose with branches of the superior epigastric artery within rectus abdominis at a variable level proximal to the umbilicus (<a href="#bib52" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Rozen et al 2008</a>).

Inferolaterally, branches anastomose with the deep circumflex iliac artery.</div><div class="text" id="p0135">The ductus (vas) deferens in males or the round ligament of the uterus in females pass medially after hooking around the inferior epigastric artery at the deep inguinal ring. The inferior epigastric vessels form the lateral border of the inguinal triangle (Hesselbach’s triangle). The boundaries of this anatomical region are seen during laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair: the inferior border of the triangle is formed by the iliopubic tract/inguinal ligament and the medial border by the lateral margin of rectus abdominis. Hernias occurring within the triangle are termed direct inguinal hernias.</div><div class="text" id="p0140">The inferior epigastric artery also gives off the cremasteric artery, a pubic branch and muscular and cutaneous branches. The cremasteric artery accompanies the spermatic cord in males, supplies cremaster and other coverings of the cord and anastomoses with the testicular artery. In females the artery is small and accompanies the round ligament of the uterus. A pubic branch, near the femoral ring, descends posterior to the pubis and anastomoses with the pubic branch of the obturator artery. The pubic branch of the inferior epigastric artery can be larger than the obturator artery and supply most of the territory of the obturator artery in the thigh, in which case it is referred to as the aberrant obturator artery (<a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_44">Pai et al 2009</a>). It lies close to the medial border of the femoral ring and can be injured during medial dissection of the ring in femoral hernia repair, laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, or with pelvic fractures. Muscular branches supply the abdominal muscles and peritoneum and anastomose with the circumflex iliac and lumbar arteries. Cutaneous branches arise within rectus abdominis, and perforate the aponeurosis of external abdominal oblique to supply the overlying skin. They anastomose with branches of the superficial epigastric artery, contributing to the ‘periumbilical perforator vessels’. These perforating vessels have been mapped in detail because they are particularly important in creating large lipocutaneous flaps on the abdominal wall: if this requires ligation of these vessels, the flap is at risk of necrosis (<a href="#bib52" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Rozen et al 2008</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0145">Occasionally, the inferior epigastric artery arises from the femoral artery. It then ascends anterior to the femoral vein, passing deep to the inguinal ligament and into the abdominal cavity before following its usual abdominal course. Rarely it arises from the external iliac artery in common with an aberrant obturator artery or from the obturator artery itself.</div><div class="text" id="p0150">The superior and inferior epigastric arteries are important sources of collateral blood flow between the internal thoracic artery, the external iliac artery and the lumbar vessels when aortic blood flow is compromised. Additionally, small tributaries of the inferior epigastric vein draining the skin around the umbilicus anastomose with terminal branches of the umbilical vein that drain into the liver via the falciform ligament. These portosystemic communications can dilate substantially in patients with portal hypertension, resulting in portal venous blood draining into the systemic circulation via the inferior epigastric veins. Back pressure to the level of the skin leads to a pattern of dilated, serpiginous superficial veins radiating out from the umbilicus, referred to as the ‘caput medusae’.</div></section><section><a id="s0080"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0075">Posterior intercostal, subcostal and lumbar arteries</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0155">In the paraspinal region, the tenth and eleventh posterior intercostal arteries, the subcostal artery and the lumbar arteries all pierce the posterior aponeurosis of transversus abdominis to enter the neurovascular plane of the abdominal wall running between transversus abdominis and internal abdominal oblique (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 60.4</span></a>). The arteries on either side run forwards, giving off muscular branches to the overlying internal and external abdominal obliques, before anastomosing with lateral branches of the superior and inferior epigastric arteries at the lateral border of the rectus sheath, just medial to the semilunar line (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 60.4</a>).

Division of these nerves can result in a segmental denervation of portions of rectus abdominis and/or the lateral anterior abdominal wall musculature.

They act together to perform a range of functions, some of which involve the generation of positive pressure within one or more body cavities. Although many of these activities can occur with no ‘forced assistance’, exhalation, defecation and micturition can be aided by the generation of positive intra-abdominal pressure. Parturition, coughing and vomiting always require such positive pressure. Under resting conditions, the tone developed within the muscles provides support for the abdominal viscera and retains the normal contour of the abdomen. The consequences of diminished muscular support can be seen in patients who have massive anterior abdominal wall hernias or congenital conditions such as ‘prune belly syndrome’ where there is deficiency or absence of these muscles.</div><div class="text" id="p0220">Active contraction of the muscles is important for maintaining abdominal wall tone. The compression of the abdominal cavity required to increase intra-abdominal pressure is mainly effected by contraction of the respiratory diaphragm. The pelvic girdle, lumbar vertebrae and distal thorax provide rigidity to parts of the abdominal wall. During the generation of positive intra-abdominal pressure, the abdominal muscles hold the abdominal wall in a relatively fixed position rather than generating pressure directly: because most of the abdominal wall is muscular, the anterolateral abdominal wall muscles must contract synchronously to prevent displacement of the viscera.</div><div class="text" id="p0225">The anterolateral abdominal muscles contribute little to the movements of the trunk during normal sitting and standing: these movements are controlled predominantly by the muscles of the back. However, movements of the trunk against resistance or when an individual is supine require the anterolateral abdominal muscles. Rectus abdominis is the most important in these situations, producing flexion of the trunk. If the pelvic girdle is fixed, the trunk is flexed. With a fixed thorax, contraction of rectus abdominis causes the pelvis to tilt and lift. Lateral flexion and rotation of the trunk against resistance is provided by unilateral contraction of external and internal abdominal obliques and transversus abdominis.</div><section><a id="s0110"/><section><a id="s0115"/><h4 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0100">Rectus abdominis</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0230">Rectus abdominis is a paired, long, strap-like muscle that extends along the entire length of the anterior abdominal wall on either side of the linea alba (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 60.8</span></a>). It varies widely in width and thickness from individual to individual but is generally widest in the proximal abdomen. The muscle fibres of rectus abdominis are usually interrupted by one to four fibrous bands (three being the most common) or tendinous intersections, which pass transversely or obliquely across the muscle. One is usually situated at the level of the umbilicus, another opposite the free end of the xiphoid process and the third about midway between the other two. They are rarely full-thickness and usually extend only half-way through the anterior thickness of the muscle, fusing with the fibres of the anterior layer of the rectus sheath. Occasionally, one or two incomplete intersections are present distal to the umbilicus. The intersections may represent the myosepta delineating the myotomes that form the muscle (<a href="#bib700" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_700">Rai et al 2018</a>).</div><section><a id="sf0025"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0025"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000604/main.assets/f60-06-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0025"/><a id="fspara0025"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 60.8</span> Muscles of the left side of the trunk.

The larger, lateral tendon is attached to the pubic crest and can extend beyond the pubic tubercle to the pecten pubis. The medial tendon interlaces with the contralateral muscle and blends with ligamentous fibres covering the front of the pubic symphysis. Additional fibres may arise from the distal part of the linea alba. The pubic attachment of the tendon of rectus abdominis and the anterior layer of the rectus sheath run over the anterior surface of the pubic symphysis and become continuous with the attachments of gracilis and adductor longus (<a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">Norton-Old et al 2013</a>). Superiorly, rectus abdominis is attached by three slips of muscle to the fifth, sixth and seventh costal cartilages.

Rectus abdominis provides a reliable and versatile myocutaneous flap, either pedicled or free, because of the excellent vascularity provided by the epigastric vessels and because the muscle belly can be separated from its surrounding sheath.</div><div class="text" id="p0110">Without vascular division (a pedicled flap), the proximal half of the muscle can be used for breast reconstruction; the distal half can be transposed to the inguinal region or proximal thigh or rotated on its distal attachments into the perineum for reconstruction after radical pelvic and perineal resections. Because the inferior epigastric vessels are sufficiently large, the distal portion of rectus abdominis can be harvested as a free flap. The vessels are ligated at their junction with the external iliac vessels and are taken together with the distal portion of rectus abdominis. The overlying fascia, adipose tissue and skin can be taken as part of the flap as necessary to manage the soft tissue defect. The free flap is then revascularized by creating anastomoses between the epigastric vessels and the vessels near the defect that is being managed by placement of the flap.</div></section><section><a id="s0140"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0115">Innervation</p><div class="textfl" id="p0250">Rectus abdominis is innervated segmentally by the terminal branches of the ventral rami of the distal six or seven thoracic spinal nerves (<a href="#bib59" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_59">Stecco et al 2017</a>).

These repairs are often reinforced with synthetic or bioprosthetic mesh applied in various ways: onlay (superficial to the superficial fascia), sublay (within the myofascial layers or placed in an extraperitoneal position) or underlay (deep to the peritoneum and exposed to intra-abdominal contents).</div><div class="text" id="p0490">Anterior component separation, originally described by Ramirez in 1990, refers to bilateral release of the external abdominal oblique muscles, which potentially can provide up to 10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm, 20<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm and 8<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm of medial mobilization at the proximal, mid and distal abdomen, respectively (<a href="#bib47" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_47">Ramirez et al 1990</a>). This mobilization permits midline approximation of rectus muscles and creates a large pocket for the onlay placement of mesh. A disadvantage of this technique is that in order to access and isolate external abdominal oblique lateral to the semilunar line from a midline incision, large subcutaneous flaps must be raised. This necessitates ligation of perforating vessels that supply the overlying subcutaneous tissue, rendering the flaps vulnerable to ischaemia, necrosis and infection. In an attempt to overcome this limitation, methods of external abdominal oblique release have been developed to preserve the periumbilical perforating vessels that traverse rectus abdominis and the anterior layer of the rectus sheath. Endoscopic techniques access the same myofascial layer through smaller, lateral incisions, while perforating-sparing open techniques create a subcutaneous tunnel proximal and distal to the umbilicus that is connected laterally (thus preserving all the blood supply that enters the abdominal wall near the umbilicus). While reducing the likelihood of wound necrosis and infection, these methods also reduce the maximum medial advancement by 1–2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm on each side and do not create the large pocket necessary for onlay placement of mesh.

A posterior layer of the rectus sheath release can also be added to create a pocket deep to rectus abdominis for the sublay placement of mesh, which for a variety of reasons could be preferable to onlay placement of mesh.</div><div class="text" id="p0495">The posterior layer of the rectus sheath can be incised independently of external abdominal oblique release, allowing access to the retromuscular space and providing several other options for medial advancement. The traditional Rives–Stoppa–Wantz technique, developed during the 1970s, involves incising the posterior layer of the rectus sheath just lateral to the linea alba, allowing a retromuscular dissection to the lateral edge of the rectus sheath. If this does not gain sufficient medial advancement, further extension can be obtained by release of transversus abdominis (<a href="#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_41">Novitsky et al 2012</a>). The posterior layer of the rectus sheath can again be incised 1–2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm medial to the semilunar line, safely preserving the laterally perforating neurovascular bundles. The division of the posterior lamella of internal abdominal oblique exposes the underlying transversus abdominis muscle belly. Delicate transection of this muscle at its most medial insertion allows access to a plane deep to transversus abdominis and superficial to the transversalis fascia, extraperitoneal fat and peritoneum. This plane of dissection can be extended laterally to psoas major, inferiorly to the retropubic space (of Retzius), and superiorly beneath the respiratory diaphragm.</div><div class="text" id="p0500">The same extraperitoneal plane can be entered directly at the linea alba. While this allows for lateral dissection, it does not provide the benefit of any fascial advancement/release. Moreover, the peritoneum is exceptionally thin and can be particularly adherent to the transversalis fascia. As a result, holes are created in predictable locations during an extraperitoneal hernia repair (such as at the costal arch and at the semilunar line at the level of the umbilicus).</div><div class="text" id="p0505">In addition to the medial mobilization of fascia aided by myofascial flap component separations, these myofascial planes allow for mesh reinforcement with extensive overlap of the hernia defect. They also prevent mesh exposure to intra-abdominal contents (<a href="#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">Heller et al 2012</a>). Multiple other component separation operations have been described, several of which necessitate division of the neurovascular bundles that enter rectus abdominis laterally. While affording medial tissue advancement and wide mesh overlap, these operations result in denervation of rectus abdominis and can lead to abdominal wall dysfunction.</div><div class="text" id="p0510">Incorrectly performed component separation procedures can result in unintended complete division of the semilunar line. This devastating complication results in iatrogenic hernias lateral to rectus that can extend from the costal arch to the inguinal ligament.

The inguinal ligament travels diagonally through the myopectineal orifice dividing it into two parts. Although the myofascial anatomy is arranged to support these areas of weakness (e.g. the deep inguinal ring, the superficial inguinal ring, the femoral canal and the inguinal triangle), the region is a common site of herniation, particularly in males. Such hernias are described by their origin within the pelvic cavity into inguinal hernias (direct and indirect) or femoral hernias (<a href="#f0115"><span class="bold">Fig. 60.19</span></a>).</div><div id="p0530"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0115"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000604/main.assets/on60-06-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0120"/><a id="fspara0130"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 60.19</span> CT of hernias of the myopectineal orifice. <span class="bold">A</span>, Indirect hernia occurring lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels containing part of the sigmoid colon. <span class="bold">B</span>, Direct inguinal hernia occurring medial to the inferior epigastric vessels containing extraperitoneal fat. <span class="bold">C</span>, Incarcerated femoral hernia occurring medial to the femoral vein and containing ischaemic omental fat.</figcaption></figure></div></div><section><a id="s0530"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0320">Indirect inguinal hernia</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0535">An indirect inguinal hernia arises through the deep inguinal ring lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels (see <a href="#f0115">Fig. 60.19A</a>). Many indirect hernias are related to the abnormal persistence of a patent processus vaginalis, a tube-like extension of peritoneum through the inguinal canal that is present during normal development and normally becomes occluded soon after birth. Others are acquired as a result of progressive weakening of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal in the region of the deep inguinal ring. The hernia can pass through the deep inguinal ring or expand the deep inguinal ring such that it is no longer a clear entity. Small indirect hernias lie distal and lateral to the fibres of the conjoint aponeurosis, but larger hernias often distort and thin the tendon superiorly. Small indirect hernias that do not protrude beyond the inguinal canal are covered by the same inner layers as the spermatic cord: namely, the internal spermatic fascia and cremaster. If the hernia extends through the superficial inguinal ring, it is also covered by the external spermatic fascia. In hernias related to a persistent fully patent processus vaginalis, the hernia contents can descend as far as the tunica vaginalis anterior to the testis. In many individuals with a partial or fully patent processus vaginalis, an indirect hernia manifests during childhood; but an actual hernia into the potential sac may not develop until adult life, often as a consequence of increased intra-abdominal pressure or sudden muscular strain.</div><div class="text" id="p0515">Indirect inguinal hernias are present in as many as 3–5% of full-term infants and upwards of 30% of premature babies.

The medial compartment of the sheath is the femoral canal, which typically contains lymphatics embedded in loose adipose connective tissue. The opening of this canal is the femoral ring, bounded anteriorly by the inguinal ligament, posteriorly by the pectineal ligament, medially by the crescentic lateral margin of the lacunar ligament and laterally by the femoral vein. A femoral hernia protrudes through the femoral ring, which is normally closed by a femoral septum of extraperitoneal tissue and is therefore a site of potential weakness: variations in the attachment of the lacunar ligament can also contribute to hernia formation.</div><div class="text" id="p0560">In females, the femoral ring is relatively wider and it changes during pregnancy, which helps to explain why femoral hernias account for about 20% of all inguinal hernias in females but less than 1% of inguinal hernias in males (<a href="#bib65" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_65">Whalen et al 2011</a>).

It is prevented from descending further by the configuration of the femoral sheath and by the attachment of fascia to the inferior horn of the saphenous opening. The hernia sac can turn anteriorly, stretching the cribriform fascia and curving upwards over the inguinal ligament within the subcutaneous tissues. While in the canal, the hernia is usually small because it is contained by the surrounding tissues, but it enlarges as it expands into the subcutaneous tissues.</div><div class="text" id="p0570">The small size and anatomical location of femoral hernias explains why they can easily be missed on physical examination, particularly in obese individuals. They are also much more prone to strangulation than inguinal hernias (<a href="#bib65" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Whalen et al 2011</a>). The site of strangulation varies: it can be at the neck of the hernia sac, at the saphenous opening, or at the junction of the falciform margin of the saphenous opening with the free edge of the lacunar ligament. If the lacunar ligament must be divided to widen the neck of the hernia and to permit reduction of the herniated contents, care must be taken to avoid or control an aberrant obturator artery (see above).</div><div class="text" id="p0575">The pubic tubercle can be a useful landmark during attempts to distinguish an inguinal from a femoral hernia: a femoral hernia lies distal and lateral to this landmark, whereas an inguinal hernia is proximal to it.
