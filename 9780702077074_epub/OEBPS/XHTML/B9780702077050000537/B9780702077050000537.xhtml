The thoracic wall includes the bony thoracic cage, extrinsic and intrinsic muscles, overlying skin and fasciae, breast tissue, numerous blood and lymphatic vessels, and nerves. It surrounds the thoracic cavity and provides an anchoring framework for muscles of respiration, muscles of the upper limb, abdomen, neck and back. The breast is a key structure related to the anterior thoracic wall, the lymphatic drainage of which passes to multiple regional node groups. Knowledge of the anatomy of the ribs, sternum, vertebrae, intercostal space, extrathoracic muscles and breast is therefore not only important in its relation to overall function, but also to the local environment of chest wall resection, reconstruction and cancer spread. Significant structural compromise can have life-threatening respiratory and circulatory consequences.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">breast; breast carcinoma; breathing; cancer; chest; intercostal; internal thoracic artery; rib; sentinel node; sternum; thoracocentesis; thorax</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The chest wall surrounds the thoracic cavity.

The thoraco-acromial artery supplies the skin primarily via musculocutaneous perforators from its pectoral branch that reach the skin through pectoralis major. Direct cutaneous branches also arise from the acromial and deltoid branches. The internal thoracic artery sends direct perforating branches to the skin covering the first (superior) six intercostal spaces and associated costal cartilages, accompanied by the cutaneous branches of the anterior intercostal nerves. The branches reach the skin after passing through pectoralis major and travelling laterally in the subcutaneous fat as direct cutaneous vessels. The right internal thoracic artery is normally larger than the left and the perforator in the second intercostal space is usually the largest. The lateral aspect of the thoracic skin is supplied by the lateral thoracic and superficial thoracic arteries, lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal arteries, and musculocutaneous branches of the thoracodorsal artery (via latissimus dorsi). The lateral thoracic artery gives off direct cutaneous branches to the lateral chest wall in addition to musculocutaneous branches that pass through pectoralis major. The posterior aspect of the thoracic skin is supplied by the medial and lateral dorsal cutaneous branches of the posterior intercostal arteries (via erector spinae and latissimus dorsi) (see <a href="#f0080">Fig. 53.18</a>); musculocutaneous perforating branches from the superficial cervical, transverse cervical and dorsal scapular arteries (via trapezius); musculocutaneous perforating branches from the thoracodorsal artery and the intercostal arteries (via latissimus dorsi); and direct cutaneous branches from the circumflex scapular artery.</div></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0040">Veins</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0030">The intercostal veins accompany the similarly named arteries in the intercostal spaces (see <a href="../B9780702077050000525/B9780702077050000525.xhtml#f0025">Fig. 52.4</a>). The small anterior intercostal veins are tributaries of the musculophrenic and internal thoracic veins, the latter draining into the ipsilateral brachiocephalic vein. The posterior intercostal veins drain directly or indirectly into the azygos vein on the right and the hemiazygos or accessory hemiazygos veins on the left. The azygos veins exhibit great variation in their origin, course, tributaries, anastomoses and termination (<a href="../B9780702077050000562/B9780702077050000562.xhtml">Ch. 56</a>).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0045">Lymphatic drainage</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0035">Superficial lymphatic vessels of the thoracic wall ramify subcutaneously and converge on the axillary nodes (see <a href="#f0165">Figs 53.22</a>, <a href="#f0095">53.24</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0030">46.5</a> and <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml">Ch. 49</a>).

The lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve (intercostobrachial nerve) supplies the skin of the axilla, lateral chest and medial arm. It courses as either a single trunk or in a bifurcating pattern (<a href="#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_21">Henry et al 2017</a>): its variability puts it at increased risk of injury during breast-related surgery, potentially resulting in postoperative pain and paraesthesia. The ventral rami of the seventh to eleventh thoracic spinal nerves supply the skin of the thoracic wall as they pass anteriorly and inferiorly; they continue beyond the costal cartilages to supply the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the abdominal wall (see <a href="../B9780702077050000604/B9780702077050000604.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 60.5</a>).

Viewed as a whole, and due to the angulation of the manubriosternal joint, the majority of the anterior surface of the sternum appears vertically convex and the posterior surface appears vertically concave. Inferiorly and proximal to the xiphoid process, the shape transitions to become vertically concave on both anterior and posterior surfaces. The geometry of the individual parts of the sternum vary with surface and region (<a href="#bib27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_27">Lindner et al 2017</a>, <a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Chakravarthi et al 2018</a>). The manubrium is the broadest part, at its joints (articulations) with the first costal cartilages. It narrows at the manubriosternal joint, gradually widens to its joints with the fifth costal cartilages, and then narrows to the xiphoid process. The sternum contains highly vascular trabecular bone enclosed by a compact layer that is thickest in the manubrium between the clavicular notches. Centrally, the bone is relatively lightly constructed; the trabeculae are thicker and wider laterally. The medullary cavity contains haematopoietic bone marrow. The sternum and its component parts may be variable in morphology, joint alignment and fusion, and can contain clefts or foramen (<a href="#bib66" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_66">Tubbs and Wantanabe 2016</a>).</div><section><a id="s0075"/><section><a id="s0080"/><h4 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0085">Manubrium of sternum</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0080">The jugular notch (superior border) of the manubrium of the sternum commonly aligns with the bodies of the second to third thoracic vertebrae, and the inferior border with the bodies of the fourth to fifth thoracic vertebrae at the manubriosternal joint.

The anterior surface is transversely convex and vertically concave in shape, whereas the posterior surface is both transversely and vertically concave. The superior border is thick in the sagittal plane and bears the jugular (suprasternal) notch in the midline between the left and right clavicular notches. The clavicular notches are directed superiorly, posteriorly and laterally for articulation with the sternal articular surface of the clavicles. Fibres of the interclavicular ligament attach to the jugular notch. The inferior border is oval and rough and carries a thin layer of hyaline cartilage for articulation with the sternal body. The lateral borders are marked at the widest part of the manubrium by a depression for the first costal cartilage (first costal notch), and, inferior to this depression, by a small articular demifacet that articulates with part of the second costal cartilage.

In some sterna, all centres are single and median; in others, the manubrial centre is single and the sternebral centres are paired, symmetric or asymmetric. Union between the sternebral centres begins at puberty and proceeds from inferior to superior; by 25 years of age, they are all united (<a href="#f0035"><span class="bold">Fig. 53.6B</span></a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0130">Suprasternal ossicles, paired or single, sometimes occur.

It is a depression of the sternum and costal cartilage that is sometimes referred to as cobbler’s chest, sunken chest, the crevasse or funnel chest. The lower (inferior) costal cartilages and the body of the sternum are depressed and there is some asymmetric curving of the ribs posteriorly. There is often an abnormal posture with dorsal lordosis, sometimes with developing scoliosis. The deformity is found either at birth (1 in 400 live births) or early in life; in the majority of cases, the condition is visible by 1 year of age but may not develop until puberty. The aetiology is unknown but some cases are associated with connective tissue diseases, such as Marfan syndrome.</div><div class="text" id="p0145">The clinical significance of pectus excavatum may vary considerably (<a href="#f0125"><span class="bold">Fig. 53.7</span></a>). Severe defects can lead to cardiopulmonary dysfunction, including changes in cardiac anatomy due to compression of the right ventricle and left atrium between the sternum and thoracic vertebral column. Almost all patients will have some degree of cosmetic concern, while back and chest pain may occur. Evaluation of the deformity demands careful symptom assessment in addition to baseline radiological investigations (chest radiograph and computed tomography (CT)). Where there are physiological restrictions, lung function tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms and MR-based strain imaging form part of the assessment before specialist clinicians can determine the safety of surgical intervention (<a href="#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">Lollert et al 2018</a>). A classification system based on morphology using CT scanning has been proposed (<a href="#bib46" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_46">Park et al 2004</a>) and is useful for standardizing the results of surgical correction of the different subtypes.</div><div id="p0150"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0125"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000537/main.assets/on53-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0125"/><a id="fspara0125"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 53.7</span> Pectus excavatum (axial CT image), showing displacement and compression of mediastinal structures.</figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="text" id="p0155">Mild defects causing aesthetic concerns may be improved with customized silicone implants (<a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_31">Masson et al 1970</a>) or with soft tissue reconstructive procedures (<a href="#bib49" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_49">Raab et al 2009</a>), to camouflage the concavity. More severe defects often require correction of the underlying skeletal deformity. Several techniques have been described. Open resection procedures were pioneered by Ravitch in the 1950s and subsequently minimally invasive techniques have gained in popularity (<a href="#bib51" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_51">Ravitch 1955</a>, <a href="#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_41">Nuss et al 1988</a>).

Additionally, 3D printing of titanium plate and polyethylene implants has allowed for advances in patient implant customization and an increase in optimal surgical outcomes (<a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_26">Lin et al 2018</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0160">Pectus carinatum, often called ‘pigeon chest’, is an overgrowth of cartilage that causes the sternum to protrude forwards. It is less common than pectus excavatum, accounting for 5–20% of anterior thoracic wall deformities: a quarter of cases are familial. The condition may occur as a solitary congenital anomaly or in association with other genetic disorders. Although present in early childhood, pectus carinatum usually progresses during adolescence and then remains unchanged throughout adulthood. In recent years treatment has gravitated towards minimally invasive or noninvasive methods of applying external pressure to the anterior chest wall to depress the sternum (<a href="#bib70" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_70">Wells and Coonar 2018</a>). Pectus carinatum occurs in three different ways, most commonly in pubertal males aged 11–14 years undergoing a growth spurt. Some parents report that their child’s pectus seemingly popped up ‘overnight’. The second most common occurrence is from birth, when it is evident in newborns as a rounded chest, becoming more prominent as the child reaches 2 or 3 years old. The least common occurrence is as an acquired condition after open heart surgery, when healing has been aberrant. Pectus carinatum may be associated with Turner, Marfan, Ehlers–Danlos, Morquio’s, Noonan’s, Sly’s or multiple lentigines syndromes, trisomies 18 or 21, homocystinuria, osteogenesis imperfecta or scoliosis.</div></section></section></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0130"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0125">Clavicle</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0165">The clavicle is described in <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml">Chapter 49</a>.</div></section><section><a id="s0135"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0130">Ribs</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0170">The ribs are 12 pairs of curved bony arches with elastic properties (as measured by their stress–strain relationship) (<a href="#f0040"><span class="bold">Fig. 53.8</span></a>).

The shaft has an external convexity and is grooved internally near its inferior border, which is sharp, whereas its superior border is rounded. The posterior vertebral end has a head, neck and tubercle. The head presents two articular facets, separated by a transversely oriented crest. The inferior and larger facet articulates with the body of the correspondingly numbered vertebra, its crest attaches to the superiorly located intervertebral disc and the smaller superior facet articulates with the body of the vertebra above.

The anterior surface of the head is related to costal parietal pleura and, in the more inferior ribs, to the sympathetic trunk and ganglia. The anterior surface of the neck of the rib is divided by a faint transverse ridge, for attachment of the internal intercostal membrane, and is continuous with the inner lip of the superior border of the shaft. The area superior to the ridge, which is more or less triangular, is separated from the membrane by fatty tissue and the area inferior to the ridge is smooth and covered by costal parietal pleura.

When a shaft is present, it is of variable length and extends anterolaterally into the posterior triangle of the neck, where it may end freely or join the first rib or its costal cartilage, or even the manubrium of the sternum. Long cervical ribs have relations similar to those of the first thoracic rib: the brachial plexus (usually lower trunk) and subclavian vessels are superior and may become compressed in the narrow angle between the rib and scalenus anterior. This anatomical relationship means that cervical ribs may first be revealed by neurovascular symptoms (thoracic outlet syndrome, see <a href="../B9780702077050000483/B9780702077050000483.xhtml">Ch. 48</a>) including ipsilateral limb pain, numbness, weakness or cold intolerance, particularly when the cervical rib puts pressure on the ventral rami of the eighth cervical and first thoracic spinal nerves. The symptoms resulting from a cervical rib are unrelated to the relative sizes of its constituent parts (specifically osseous vs fibrous).

The upper seven pairs articulate with the sternum; the eighth to tenth articulate with the inferior border of the costal cartilage above; and the lowest <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1004" id="pagebreak_1004"/><a id="pg1004"/>two have free, pointed ends located within the soft tissue of the abdominal wall (see <a href="#f0065">Figs 53.14</a>, <a href="#f0140">53.15B</a>). The costal cartilages increase in length from the first to the seventh, and then decrease to the twelfth. They diminish in breadth/height from first to last, as do the intercostal spaces. They are broad at their articulation with the ribs and taper as they pass anteriorly and toward the midline. The first and second are of even breadth and the sixth to eighth enlarge where their margins are in contact. The first descends a little, the second is horizontal and the third ascends slightly; the others are angulated and incline superomedially towards the sternum or cartilage above, in a plane slightly anterior to their ribs.</div><div class="text" id="p0280">Each costal cartilage has two surfaces, borders and ends. The external (anterior/anterosuperior) surface is convex. The sternoclavicular articular disc, costoclavicular ligament and subclavius are all attached to the external surface of the first costal cartilage, pectoralis major is attached to the medial ends of the first six costal cartilages, rectus abdominis to the fifth to seventh and others, including the costal cartilages forming the costal arch (margin) offer attachment sites for the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. The internal (posterior/posteroinferior) surface is concave. Sternothyroid is attached to the internal surface of the first costal cartilage, transversus thoracis is attached to the second to seventh costal cartilages, and transversus abdominis is attached to the seventh to twelfth costal cartilages. The internal intercostal muscles and external intercostal membranes are attached to the concave superior and convex inferior borders. At around the point (apex) of maximum convexity of the inferior border of the sixth (sometimes the fifth) to ninth costal cartilages an inferiorly facing oblong articular facet articulates with a superiorly facing articular facet on the superior border of the cartilage below via a synovial interchondral joint. The lateral end of each cartilage articulates with its corresponding rib. The medial end of the first cartilage articulates with the manubrium of the sternum; the medial ends of the six succeeding cartilages are round and articulate with shallow costal notches on the lateral margins of the body of the sternum (and the manubrium in the case of the second); those of the eighth to tenth are pointed and articulate with the costal cartilage above; and those of the eleventh and twelfth are pointed and free. With the exceptions of the fibrous synarthrosis between the first rib and sternum, and the costal cartilages of the ninth and tenth ribs, all the articulations are synovial. Costal cartilages may undergo calcification with age (<a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">Middleham et al 2015</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0330"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0205">Rib fractures</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0290">Despite their pliability, the ribs are much more frequently broken when compared to the sternum; the anterior and anterolateral portions of the middle to lower ribs are the most vulnerable. The elastic recoil of the ribs that articulate with and effectively suspend the sternum may explain the rarity of sternal fractures. Because traumatic stress is often the result of compression of the thorax, the usual site of fracture is just anterior to the angle of the rib, the weakest point of the bone, however direct impact may fracture a rib at any point. Nearly 10% of all patients admitted after blunt force thoracic trauma have one or more rib fractures. Morbidity and mortality increase as the number of fractured ribs increases (<a href="#bib65" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_65">Tomas et al 2017</a>): the ends of the broken bone may be driven inwards and potentially injure thoracic or upper abdominal viscera (<a href="#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_24">Kasotakis et al 2017</a>). The pain associated with rib fracture, particularly multiple rib fractures in older adults, can predispose to pneumonia by limiting normal airway protective mechanisms (e.g. cough).</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0335"/><hgroup><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0210">Joints</h2><h3 class="h2after1" id="cesectitle0215">Manubriosternal joint</h3></hgroup><section><a id="s0340"/><div class="textfl" id="p0295">The manubriosternal joint lies between the manubrium and the body of the sternum approximately 7<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm below (inferior to) the jugular (suprasternal) notch of the manubrium.

Occasionally, in individuals over the age of 30 years, the manubrium appears to be joined to the body of the sternum by bone. However, the intervening cartilage may be only superficially ossified because ossification is not completed until late adult life.

The facets on the tubercles of the first six ribs are oval and vertically convex, and fit corresponding concavities on the anterior surfaces of the transverse processes of the vertebrae; up and down movements of tubercles consequently involve rotation of the costal necks about their long axes. The facets on the tubercles of the seventh to tenth ribs are almost flat and face posteriorly, inferiorly and medially; the opposing articular surfaces are located on the superior aspects of the transverse processes, which means that when these tubercles move superiorly, they also move posteromedially.

The relationship of sternalis to pectoralis major may cause a diagnostic dilemma during breast surgery, mammography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans because its appearance mimics tumour pathology of the region. The mammographic appearance of sternalis is variable. Typically visible in the medial aspect of the breast on a craniocaudal (CC) mammogram, it appears as a small soft tissue density or mass abutting the thoracic wall. Its margins and shape are variable.

According to <a href="#bib52" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_52">Rehnke et al (2018)</a>, the glandular breast tissue is surrounded on its superficial and deep surfaces by anterior and posterior laminae, respectively, of superficial fascia and fat (see <a href="#f0090">Fig. 53.23B</a>). The fascial laminae and deep fascial system of the trunk interconnect around the perimeter of the breast via the circummammary ligament, a circular zone of adhesion traversed by nerves, blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. The breast lies on the deep pectoral fascia covering pectoralis major and serratus anterior superiorly, external abdominal oblique and its aponeurosis inferiorly as the latter forms the anterior wall of the rectus sheath, and the clavipectoral fascia laterally. Fibrous strands or sheets consisting of condensations of connective tissue extend between the posterior lamina of the superficial fascia and the dermis. These suspensory ligaments (retinacula or Cooper’s ligaments) are often well developed in the superior parts of the breast and support the breast tissue, helping to minimize drooping. Loose connective tissue in the submammary space (between the posterior lamina of superficial fascia and the deep fascia of the trunk) allows the breast some degree of independent movement across the deep pectoral fascia. Advanced mammary carcinoma may cause tethering or fixation of the breast and its skin to the underlying musculature, resulting in indentation of the skin or breast movement upon contraction of pectoralis major. Occasionally, small projections of glandular tissue may pass through the deep fascia into the underlying muscle in normal subjects.</div></section><section><a id="s1165"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0665">Nipple and areola</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0830">The nipple projects from the breast anteriorly (see <a href="#f0090">Fig. 53.23</a>). It may be cylindrical and rounded, hemispherical or flattened, depending on the effects of developmental, nervous or hormonal factors and external temperature on the erectile properties of the subareolar muscle of the nipple. The level of the nipple varies widely. In females, its site is dependent on the size and shape of the breasts; it often overlies the fourth intercostal space in prepubescent females. In the male, the nipple is usually sited in the fourth intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line, although this should not be relied upon when landmarking. In the young adult of either sex, the nipples are usually positioned 20–23<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm from the suprasternal notch in the mid-clavicular line and 19–23<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm apart in the horizontal plane. With increasing age, parity and weight, female breasts adopt an increasingly drooped shape and the position of the nipple descends to the level of the inframammary crease or below. In the nulliparous, the nipple is pink, light brown or darker, depending on the general melanization of the body. Occasionally, one or both nipples may not evert during prenatal development and remain permanently retracted (see below).</div><div class="text" id="p0835">The skin covering the nipple and the surrounding areola (the disc of skin that circles the base of the nipple) has a convoluted surface. It contains numerous sweat and areolar (Montgomery’s) glands that open directly onto the skin surface. The oily secretion of these specialized sebaceous glands acts as a protective lubricant and facilitates latching of the neonate during lactation; the glands are often visible in parous women, arranged circumferentially as small elevations, areolar (Montgomery’s) tubercles, around the areola close to the margin. Other areolar glands, intermediate in structure between mammary and sweat glands, become enlarged in pregnancy and lactation as subcutaneous tubercles. The <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1014" id="pagebreak_1014"/><a id="pg1014"/>sebaceous glands of the areola are not usually associated with hair follicles although scattered hairs may be present at the areolar margin. The skin of the nipple and areola is rich in melanocytes and is therefore typically darker than the skin covering the remainder of the breast; the areola increases in size and further darkening occurs during the second month of pregnancy and subsequently persists to a variable degree.</div></section><section><a id="s1170"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0670">Soft tissue</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0840">The breasts are normally composed of up to 20 discrete lobes that contain ductal-glandular tissue consisting of branching ducts and terminal secretory lobules in a connective tissue stroma (see <a href="#f0090">Fig. 53.23</a>). Each lobe is derived by branching from one central lactiferous duct in the nipple. The terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU or lobule) is the functional milk secretory component of the breast. Histological evidence suggests premalignant epithelial proliferations originate from the TDLU; alternatively, a predisposition to malignant transformation may be present throughout an individual lobe (‘sick lobe’ hypothesis), creating an impression of multifocality. Although lobes are usually described as discrete territories, they intertwine in three dimensions, merge at their edges and cannot be distinguished during surgery. The interlobular connective tissue stroma is dense and fibrocollagenous, whereas intralobular connective tissue has a loose texture that allows the rapid expansion of secretory tissue during pregnancy (see <a href="#f0090">Figs 53.23B</a>, <a href="#f0120">53.29B</a>). Elsewhere in the normal breast, fibrous tissue surrounds the ductal glandular components and extends to the skin and nipple, assisting the mechanical coherence of the breast. The interlobular stroma contains variable amounts of adipose tissue, which is responsible for much of the increase in breast size at puberty.</div></section><section><a id="s1175"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0675">Vascular supply and lymphatic drainage</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0680">Arteries</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s1180"/><div class="textfl" id="p0845">The breasts are supplied by branches of the axillary, internal thoracic and some anterior intercostal arteries.

The dominant lymphatic drainage of the breast is derived from the dermal network (<a href="#f0095"><span class="bold">Fig. 53.24</span></a>). Breast lymphatics branch extensively; the smallest valveless superficial lymph capillaries (20–70μm diameter) drain into larger lymph pre-collecting vessels (∼300<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm diameter) that contain valves and smooth muscle.

Lymphatic blockage through tumour occlusion may therefore result in reverse flow through the lymphatic channels, resulting in oedema. The direction of lymphatic flow within the breast parallels the major venous tributaries and enters the regional lymph nodes via an extensive periductal and perilobular network of lymphatic channels. Most of these lymphatics drain into the axillary group of regional lymph nodes either directly or through the subareolar lymphatic plexus (see <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495_split_a.xhtml#f0205">Fig. 49.48</a>).

There may be one or two interpectoral (Rotter’s) nodes lying between pectoralis minor and major. Efferent vessels may pass directly from the breast around the anterior axillary border and through the axillary fascia to the anterior axillary (pectoral) lymph nodes; some may pass directly to the posterior axillary (subscapular) nodes. A few vessels pass from the superior part of the breast to the apical axillary nodes, sometimes interrupted by the infraclavicular nodes or by small, inconstant, interpectoral nodes.

The majority of pectoral (Pecs) blocks are performed under general anaesthetic and ultrasound guidance. The Pecs I block targets the medial and lateral pectoral nerves located in the fascial plane between pectoralis major and minor. The Pecs II block can be used in addition to Pecs I to extend coverage to the axilla and serratus anterior area by blocking the intercostobrachial nerve, the third to the sixth intercostal nerves (including their lateral cutaneous branches) and the long thoracic nerve. The anaesthetic agent is directed between pectoralis minor and serratus anterior, in the plane deep to the fascia covering serratus anterior. These blocks provide consistent effective regional analgesia, reducing postoperative pain and the need for opioid pain relief. Serratus blocks were developed to extend analgesia to the lateral thorax from the second to ninth intercostal nerves and have been used for both postsurgical breast and thoracotomy pain.

The bases of these cells are in close contact with numerous myoepithelial cells of ectodermal origin, similar to those of certain other glandular epithelia (see <a href="#f0120">Figs 53.29A</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000021/B9780702077050000021.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 2.3</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000021/B9780702077050000021.xhtml#f0025">Fig. 2.4</a>). Myoepithelial cells are so numerous that they form a distinct layer surrounding the ducts and presumptive alveoli, and give the epithelium a bilayer appearance.</div><div class="text" id="p0920">Lactiferous ducts draining each lobe of the breast pass through the nipple and open on to its tip as up to 20 orifices. Close to their openings on the nipple, the stratified cuboidal epithelial lining of the lactiferous ducts is replaced by keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, continuous with the epidermis. Shed squames may <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1016" id="pagebreak_1016"/><a id="pg1016"/>sometimes block the duct apertures in the non-pregnant breast. The ducts are slightly expanded at the base of the nipple, and there is considerable variation in duct diameter throughout the breast (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Cooper 1840</a>). The ductal system expands as it fills with milk during lactation, dilating even further to accommodate milk flow at milk ejection (<a href="#bib50" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_50">Ramsay et al 2005</a>). Each lactiferous duct is connected to a complex system of ducts and lobules, surrounded by connective tissue stroma, collectively forming a lobe of the breast (see <a href="#f0090">Fig. 53.23B</a>). Lobes vary in size, shape and depth. A single lobe may comprise from as little as 1% to as much as a 25% of the entire breast. Vestigial lobes have been identified and are composed of long ducts running deep into the breast with very few or no branches or glandular tissue. The presence of these lobes suggests a competitive process of ductal expansion and in part explains the observation of fewer functional lobes during lactation (<a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Going and Moffat 2004</a>).

They are surrounded by somatopleuric mesenchyme that forms the connective tissue, fat and vasculature that is invaded by the nerves to the breast.

Nipple formation begins during stage 23, primitive ducts (mammary sprouts) develop from postmenstrual week 15, and canalization occurs at about postmenstrual week 24. During postmenstrual weeks 33–40, the ducts become canalized and the epidermis at the point of original development of the gland forms a small mammary pit, into which the lactiferous ducts open. Perinatally, the nipple is formed by mesenchymal proliferation. Should this process fail, the ducts open into shallow pits.

The female breast is a unique organ in that it remains in a rudimentary (i.e. fetal) form until puberty, at which time its development continues under the influence of sex hormones. The adult form is reached in late adolescence, after which the breast is able to progress to a fully functioning milk-producing organ following pregnancy and childbirth.

Alveoli develop at their termini and expand as their cells and lumina fill with newly synthesized and secreted milk. The myoepithelial cells, which are initially spindle-shaped, become highly branched stellate cells, especially around the alveoli. Adjacent myoepithelial cells intermesh to form a basket-like network around the alveoli and ducts, interposed between the basal lamina and the luminal cells (see <a href="../B9780702077050000021/B9780702077050000021.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 2.3</a>).

Typically there is a concomitant reduction in adipose tissue in the stroma. The numbers of lymphocytes, including plasma cells, and eosinophils increase greatly. Blood flow through the breast increases to approximately double that of the non-pregnant state. Secretory activity in the alveolar cells rises progressively in the latter half of pregnancy. In late pregnancy, and for a few days after parturition, their product is different from later milk and is known as colostrum, characteristically low in lipid but rich in protein and immunoglobulins. Proliferation of the glandular breast parenchyma results in an overall increase in breast size through gestation.</div></section><section><a id="s1295"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0770">Lactation</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0995">True milk secretion begins a few days after parturition as a result of a reduction in circulating oestrogen and progesterone, a change that appears to stimulate production of prolactin by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Milk distends the alveoli so that the cells flatten as secretion increases (see <a href="#f0090">Fig. 53.23B</a>; <a href="#f0120"><span class="bold">Fig. 53.29</span></a>). The alveolar cell cytoplasm accumulates membrane-bound granules of casein and other milk proteins and these are released from the apical plasma membrane by membrane fusion (merocrine secretion; see <a href="../B9780702077050000021/B9780702077050000021.xhtml#f0035">Fig. 2.6</a>). Lipid vacuoles are formed directly in the apical cytoplasm as small lipid droplets that fuse with each other to create large ‘milk vacuoles’ up to 10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm across.

Hormonal stimulation by oxytocin causes myoepithelial cells to contract and expel alveolar secretions into the ductal system in readiness for suckling. After the onset of lactation there is a gradual reduction in the numbers of lymphocytes and eosinophils in the stroma, although plasma cells continue to synthesize immunoglobulin A (IgA) for secretion into the milk. Alveolar cells take up IgA synthesized by adjacent plasma cells by endocytosis at their basal surfaces and secrete it apically, as dimers complexed to the epithelial secretory component.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0120"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000537/main.assets/f53-25-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0115"/><a id="fspara0115"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 53.29</span> The microstructure of breast epithelium. <span class="bold">A</span>, Note that the myoepithelial cell process is actually about half the relative size of that shown in the lower diagram. <span class="bold">B</span>, The peripheral part of a lactating breast lobule.

Whenever it finishes, the secretory tissue undergoes some involution but the ducts and alveoli never return completely to the pre-pregnant state. Two major processes are responsible for the regression of the alveolar–ductal system: a reduction in epithelial cell size and a reduction in cell numbers mediated via apoptosis. Gradually, the breast tissue reverts to its resting state. If another pregnancy occurs, the resting glandular tissue is reactivated and the process outlined above recurs. Up to the age of about 50 years, increasing amounts of elastic tissue tend to be laid down around vessels and ducts (elastosis), and in the stroma: elastosis does not normally continue into later life.</div><section><a id="s1305"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0780">Mammary stem cells</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1010">Postpartum mammary stem cells (MaSC) differ from other adult stem cells because they are likely to be involved in organ homeostasis and in postnatal development of the gland through each menstrual and reproductive cycle.

Rapid and extensive bleeds often clot and therefore limit the success of this procedure.</div><div class="text" id="p1090">Pericardiocentesis is performed in either the fifth or sixth left intercostal space near the sternum (to avoid the more laterally located internal thoracic vessels) or 1–2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm to the left of the angle between the junction of the xiphoid process and left costal arch.

The patient is placed in a lateral decubitus position with adequate support of the elbow, axilla and knee with padding. The standard approach is via an incision from the anterior axillary line, which curves about 4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm inferior to the inferior angle (tip) of the scapula and then vertically between the posterior midline and medial border of the scapula. The incision is usually extended to the level of the spine of the scapula. Overall, the incision forms an S-shape following the fifth intercostal space. The sixth or seventh intercostal space is used in oesophageal surgery.</div><div class="text" id="p1110">The inferior portions of trapezius and latissimus dorsi are divided. Serratus anterior is retracted, and may be divided in a high (superior) thoracotomy. The costal muscle and pleura are dissected along the inferior margin of the intercostal space to avoid damaging the neurovascular bundle. The intercostal space should be spread slowly to avoid rib fracture: a small section of the posterior part of the rib may be removed to reduce the risk of fracture, particularly in patients older than 40 years. This technique provides good access to the thoracic contents; the main complication is postoperative pain as a consequence of intraoperative musculoskeletal traction, rib fracture and damage to the intercostal nerves.</div></section><section><a id="s1385"/><p class="h8hd" id="cesectitle0830">Anterolateral incision</p><div class="textfl" id="p1115">The patient is placed in the supine position, with their arms by their sides. A roll is placed vertically under the back and hips in order to raise the operative side by approximately 45°. The incision is from the mid-axillary line over the fifth intercostal space along the inframammary skin fold, and curves superiorly parasternally. The pectoral muscles are divided, and subsequent access to the thorax is similar to that used in the posterolateral approach: access is limited, and may be improved by dividing costal cartilages.</div></section><section><a id="s1390"/><p class="h8hd" id="cesectitle0835">‘Clam shell’</p><div class="textfl" id="p1120">The transverse thoracosternotomy (‘clam shell’ incision) provides excellent exposure to both sides of the thoracic cavity and is therefore used in bilateral lung transplantation and in lung volume reduction surgery with bilateral lung resections. The patient is placed in the supine position with a roll vertically along the upper thoracic spine. Bilateral anterolateral incisions are made along the fifth intercostal space (or inframammary fold), and the sternum is transected. This allows the part of the thorax superior to the incision to be displaced upwards with a rib-spreader, hence the name ‘clam shell’. The main disadvantage of the clam shell procedure is the need to transect the sternum; even after careful repair with sternal wires, there is a risk of sternal instability. This incision (in the fourth or fifth intercostal space) is also used for emergency access to the thorax in cases of loss of cardiac output from cardiac tamponade often resulting from penetrating trauma; spontaneous return of cardiac output may result from the rapid resolution of a tamponade and haemostasis.</div></section></section></section></section></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s14125"/><section><a id="s14225"/><section><a id="s14325"/><section><a id="s14425"/><section><a id="s14525"/><section><a id="s14625"/><section><a id="s14725"/><p class="h7hd" id="s8425">Sternotomy</p><div class="textfl" id="p1130">Sternotomy is commonly needed in cardiac surgery. The patient is placed in the supine position with both arms extended by their side. A vertical incision is made in the midline (median plane) from the jugular (suprasternal) notch to a point just inferior to the xiphoid process, the tissues around the manubrium of the sternum and the xiphoid process are mobilized, and the pectoral fascia in the midline is incised. The sternum is divided equally and its two left and right halves retracted; it is subsequently closed using interosseous wire sutures.</div></section><section><a id="s1430"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0845">Axillary thoracotomy</p><div class="textfl" id="p1140">The patient is placed in the lateral decubitus position, with arms abducted at 90° and supported on an arm rest. The incision is based along the desired intercostal space: for upper thoracic access, this is the second or third intercostal space. Latissimus dorsi is elevated and retracted, whereas serratus anterior is divided in the direction of its fibres. The anterior aspect of serratus anterior is divided to expose the intercostal muscles, which are divided in turn. Although the overall size of the incision is limited, it provides good access to the upper thorax. Postoperative pain is less than with some other approaches, but the long thoracic nerve may be damaged if serratus anterior is divided too posteriorly. The nerve is commonly located in the region between the mid and posterior axillary lines (<a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_14">Ebraheim et al 1998</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s1435"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0850">Thoracoscopic access</p><div class="textfl" id="p1150">Occasionally, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is required to assess the mediastinum. The thoracoscope is usually introduced via the fifth intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line, with additional ports at the third and sixth intercostal spaces to assess the anterior mediastinum. To assess the posterior mediastinum, the thoracoscope is inserted into the seventh intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line.</div></section><section><a id="s1440"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0855">Placement of electrocardiograph (ECG) leads</p><div class="textfl" id="p1160">The 12-lead ECG provides three-dimensional information on the electrical activity of the heart.
