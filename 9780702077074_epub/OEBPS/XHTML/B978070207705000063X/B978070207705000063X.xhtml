It runs obliquely to the left and slightly posteriorly and ends at the gastro-oesophageal junction, where it is continuous with the cardiac orifice of the stomach. Its anterior wall is effectively longer than its posterior wall because of the obliquity of the diaphragmatic crura. The abdominal part of the oesophagus lies posterior to the left lobe of the liver and anterior to the left crus of the respiratory diaphragm, the left inferior phrenic vessels and the left greater and lesser thoracic splanchnic nerves. Its surface is covered by a thin layer of connective tissue and visceral peritoneum that contains the anterior and posterior vagus nerves and the oesophageal branches of the left gastric vessels. The anterior and posterior vagal trunks can be single or composed of multiple trunks (<a href="#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_19">Jackson 1949</a>); the anterior vagal trunk is closely applied to the anterior outer surface of the longitudinal muscle coat of the oesophagus lying in the 2 o’clock position. It is often a thread-like nerve and difficult to visualize. It is imperative that the surgeon appreciates the position of the anterior vagal trunk to avoid injury leading to gastroparesis during a cardiomyotomy or fundoplication. The posterior vagal trunk is a more substantial structure that usually lies within loose connective tissue immediately posterior and to the right of the oesophagus, making its identification during surgery somewhat easier. However, the position of the trunk can vary; it can lie anywhere on the right side of the oeosphagus. Again it is imperative that the surgeon identify the nerve at fundoplication to avoid injury or incorporation into the wrap. Unlike the more proximal parts of the oesophagus, the muscular wall of the abdominal part of the oesophagus is composed entirely of smooth muscle.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">The abdominal part of the oesophagus is effectively tethered to the margins of the oesophageal hiatus by the phrenico-oesophageal ligament and probably acts to limit upward and downward mobility of the oesophagus within the oesophageal hiatus (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Kwok et al 1999</a>, <a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_10">Apaydin et al 2008</a>). The importance of this anchor function has been recognized in more recent times by surgeons performing fundoplications, many of whom now reconstruct the ligament with sutures between the left lateral oesophagus and the left crus (<a href="#f0090"><span class="bold">Fig. 63.1</span></a>). The ligament is formed by two circumferential layers of elastin- and collagen-rich connective tissue containing smooth muscle fibres. The distal layer is an extension of the transversalis fascia inferior to the respiratory diaphragm; it is thin and only loosely attached to the oesophagus. The proximal layer is continuous with the endothoracic fascia superior to the respiratory diaphragm; it is thicker, contains more elastin than its inferior counterpart, and runs cranially and obliquely to fuse firmly with the wall of the oesophagus. A variable amount of adipose tissue lies in the triangular interval between the two layers of the ligament. In the elderly, the ligament tends to become attenuated: it loses collagen fibres and contains more adipose tissue. The phrenico-oesophageal ligament is denser anteriorly where it bridges between the outer layer of the oesophageal wall and the arching fibres of the crura of the diaphragm. Identification of the phrenico-oesophageal ligament on the thinner portion of the left crus is the gateway to safe mobilization of the oesophagus during surgery: once it is breached, the oesophagus can be easily mobilized and the aorta viewed posteriorly.</div><div id="p0025"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0090"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000063X/main.assets/on63-01ac-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000063X/main.assets/on63-01de-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0090"/><a id="fspara0095"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 63.1</span> <span class="bold">A–E</span>, The anatomical structures around the abdominal part of the oesophagus. <span class="bold">B</span>–<span class="bold">C</span>, Coronal CT.<span class="bold">D–E</span>, Axial CT. <br/><span class="figcredit">A, Reprinted from Netter Anatomy Illustration Collection, © Elsevier Inc.

It encloses the oesophageal branches of the left gastric vessels and the coeliac branches of the posterior vagal trunk and can thus be considered to form an extremely short, wide mesentery to the abdominal part of the oesophagus. In adults, a fat pad is sometimes visible beneath the peritoneum over the anterior surface of the gastro-oesophageal junction and can be a useful surgical marker of the gastro-oesophageal junction.</div><section><a id="s0030"/><section><a id="s0035"/><section><a id="s0040"/><h3 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0025">Hiatal hernia</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0040">Hiatal hernia is a relatively common condition involving expansion of the oesophageal hiatus and herniation of the stomach through the respiratory diaphragm into the thorax. It is more common in elderly and obese individuals. There are two types of hiatal hernia: the sliding type accounts for at least 90%, and the para-oesophageal or mixed type makes up the remainder (<a href="#bib51" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_51">Roman and Kahrilas 2014</a>). In a sliding hiatal hernia the abdominal part of the oesophagus and cardia of the stomach traverse the oesophageal hiatus. In contrast, with a para-oesophageal hiatal hernia the abdominal part of the oesophagus and pylorus lie beneath the diaphragm and a varying portion of the stomach passes through the hiatus. On occasion, the entire stomach can rotate, forming an ‘upside-down stomach’ with the stomach twisted around its axis. It is important that endoscopists appreciate the anatomical differences between the two herniae in order to distinguish correctly between them. A hiatal hernia can be asymptomatic or associated with symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Para-oesophageal hiatal hernias can cause obstruction and/or ischaemia of the herniated part of the stomach. Treatment of a symptomatic sliding hiatal hernia is directed at managing associated gastro-oesophageal reflux. If suppression of acid production by medication fails, the patient may require anti-reflux surgery. This has traditionally consisted of a fundoplication, but a small flexible band of interlinked titanium beads with magnetic cores applied around the lower oesophageal sphincter is increasingly becoming the first line in the surgical management of medically recalcitrant gastro-oesophageal reflux.</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0045"/><section><a id="s0050"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0030">Vascular supply and lymphatic drainage</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0035">Arteries</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0055"/><div class="textfl" id="p0045">The abdominal part of the oesophagus is supplied by numerous oesophageal branches of the left gastric artery that ascend beneath the visceral peritoneum to supply perforating branches to the intramural and submucosal plexuses. The posterior surface usually receives an additional blood supply via branches of the upper short gastric arteries, reinforced by terminal arteries from the oesophageal branches of the descending thoracic aorta and occasionally an ascending branch of the posterior gastric artery (<a href="#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_24">Liebermann-Meffert et al 1987</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0060"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0040">Veins</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0050">Mucosal and submucosal veins drain via plexuses to the left gastric and upper short gastric veins in the abdomen and to the azygos/hemiazygos system of veins in the thorax. The distal oesophagus is an important site of porto-systemic anastomosis where oesophageal varices develop in portal hypertension (see below).</div></section><section><a id="s0065"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0045">Lymphatic drainage</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0055">The lymphatics of the oesophagus are concentrated into submucosal and intermuscular plexuses. Both of these plexuses receive lymph from all layers of the oesophageal wall (<a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_22">Kuge et al 2003</a>, <a href="#bib49" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_49">Rice et at 2016</a>). Terminology is not straightforward. In general, lymphatic drainage from the oesophagus communicates with nodes in the adventitia, para-oesophageal nodes or the thoracic duct directly (<a href="#bib64" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_64">Wang et al 2018</a>). However, the lymphatics of the distal third of the oesophagus do not <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1161" id="pagebreak_1161"/>drain to para-oesophageal nodes of the same level but distally to the left gastric nodes and nodes around the cardia, and then to coeliac nodes (<a href="#bib60" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_60">Tachimori 2017</a>). Therefore, cancer of the lower thoracic oesophagus tends to metastasize to nodes of the upper abdominal area (<a href="#bib61" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_61">Tamaki et al 2012</a>).</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0070"/><section><a id="s0075"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0050">Innervation</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0060">The oesophagus has a well-developed intrinsic nervous system consisting of a ganglionated myenteric plexus and a sparsely ganglionated submucosal plexus, modulated by extrinsic autonomic nerves. Parasympathetic innervation of the abdominal part of the oesophagus is derived directly from the oesophageal plexus and, to a lesser extent, from the anterior and posterior vagal trunks. These nerves are motor to the distal oesophagus and both stimulatory and inhibitory to the lower oesophageal sphincter, maintaining basal tone and coordinating distal oesophageal peristalsis with relaxation of the sphincter during swallowing (the latter being mediated by intrinsic nitrergic inhibitory neurones under vagus nerve control). Sympathetic supply to the distal oesophagus originates from the fifth to twelfth thoracic spinal segments mainly via the greater and lesser thoracic splanchnic nerves and the coeliac plexus. Nociceptive signals are conveyed by afferent nerves accompanying sympathetic nerves and by vagus nerve afferents, which are also involved in mechanosensory signalling (<a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Neuhuber et al 2006</a>).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0080"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0055">Stomach</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0065">The stomach is the widest part of the alimentary tract and lies between the oesophagus and the duodenum. It performs numerous functions, including the temporary storage of ingested nutrients, mechanical breakdown of solid food, chemical digestion of proteins, regulation of the passage of chyme into the duodenum, secretion of intrinsic factor for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption, secretion of gut hormones and secretion of acid to aid digestion (including the absorption of iron). It is also important in microbial defence.</div><div class="text" id="p0070">The stomach is situated in the upper abdomen, extending from the left upper quadrant downwards, forwards and to the right, lying in the left hypochondriac, epigastric and umbilical regions. It occupies a recess beneath the respiratory diaphragm and anterior abdominal wall bounded by the upper abdominal viscera on either side. Its mean capacity increases from approximately 20–30<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>ml at birth to approximately 1000–1500<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>ml in adults.

The internal appearance and microstructure of these regions vary. The fundus is dome-shaped and projects above and to the left of the oesophageal opening (cardiac orifice) to lie in contact with the left side of the respiratory diaphragm; it lies above a horizontal line drawn from the cardiac notch to the greater curvature. The body extends from the fundus to the angular incisure, a constant external notch at the lower end of the lesser curvature. The cardia is the region of the stomach adjacent to the oesophageal opening. A line drawn from the angular incisure to an inconstant indentation on the greater curvature defines the lower boundary of the body. The pyloric antrum extends from this line to where the stomach narrows to become the pyloric canal (1–2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm long), which terminates at the pyloric orifice (<a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_14">Didio and Anderson 1968</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000063X/main.assets/f63-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 63.2</span> The parts of the stomach.</figcaption></figure></div></section><section><a id="s0090"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0065">Gastric relations</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0070">Gastric curvatures</h4><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0075">Lesser curvature</h5></hgroup><section><a id="s0095"/><section><a id="s0100"/><div class="textfl" id="p0080">The lesser curvature extends between the cardiac and pyloric orifices and forms the medial border of the stomach.

It ends at the pylorus, just to the right of the midline.

It starts from the cardiac notch, formed between the lateral border of the abdominal part of the oesophagus and the fundus of the stomach, and arches upwards, posterolaterally and to the left. Its highest convexity, the apex of the fundus, is approximately level with the left sixth rib anteriorly but varies among individuals and during respiration (<a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Mirjalili et al 2012</a>). From this point, it sweeps inferiorly and anteriorly, slightly convex to the left, almost as far as the tenth costal cartilage in the supine position, where it turns medially to end at the pylorus in the transpyloric plane at the lower border of the first lumbar vertebra. There is frequently a groove, the intermediate sulcus, in the curvature close to the pyloric canal. The start of the greater curvature is covered by peritoneum, which continues over the anterior surface of the stomach. Laterally, the greater curvature gives attachment to the gastrosplenic ligament and, below this, to the greater omentum, which contains the gastro-omental (gastro-epiploic) vessels. The gastrosplenic ligament and the greater omentum, together with the gastrophrenic and splenorenal ligaments, are continuous derivatives of the original dorsal mesogastrium; their names merely indicate regions of the same continuous sheet of peritoneum and its associated connective tissue.</div></section><section><a id="s0110"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0085">Gastric volvulus</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0095">Gastric volvulus is much less common than volvulus of either the sigmoid colon or the caecum. It occurs when the stomach rotates abnormally and may be organo-axial or mesentero-axial. In organo-axial volvulus, the axis of rotation runs from below the cardiac orifice to the pylorus: the pyloric antrum, body and fundus rotate upwards such that the greater curvature comes to lie above the lesser curvature. In mesentero-axial volvulus, rotation occurs about an axis drawn ‘across’ the body of the stomach, usually just above the angular incisure. This type of volvulus is perpendicular to the axis of organo-axial volvulus. The distal body and pyloric antrum rotate anteriorly, superiorly and laterally while the upper body and fundus rotate posteriorly, medially and inferiorly. Although it is relatively mobile within the upper abdomen, the stomach is normally tethered at the gastro-oesophageal junction and the pylorus; to the spleen by the gastrosplenic ligament; and to the liver by the hepatogastric ligament. The attachment to the transverse colon via the gastrocolic ligament also restrains the stomach but this is the most mobile attachment. For either type of gastric volvulus to occur, some or all of these points of tethering must be loosened either by previous surgical division or by chronic lengthening and laxity of their connective tissue. Organo-axial volvulus is more common because the lesser omentum, and gastrosplenic and gastrocolic ligaments are more likely to undergo chronic lengthening by traction than the other attachments of the stomach. Mesentero-axial volvulus requires the gastro-oesophageal junction and pylorus to be sufficiently mobile so as to come into close approximation, which is much less common. Despite the rich arterial supply to the stomach, either type of volvulus can cause a strangulating obstruction.</div><div class="text" id="p0100">Provided the detorted stomach is viable, gastric volvulus is typically managed by fixation of the anterior surface of the stomach to the anterior abdominal wall (‘gastropexy’) (<a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">García et al 2013</a>): the recurrence rate is very high. An alternative is to insert one or more percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes to fix the stomach to the anterior abdominal wall, a manoeuvre that is particularly useful in the unfit patient when a lengthy surgical procedure is contraindicated. Gastric volvulus of the organo-axial type is frequently associated with a para-oesophageal hiatal hernia that must also be repaired. This surgery can usually be carried out laparoscopically and most surgeons would advocate performing a combination of a hiatal repair, fundoplication with or without a gastropexy.</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0115"/><section><a id="s0120"/><section><a id="s0125"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0090">Gastric surfaces</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0105">When the stomach is empty and contracted, the anterior and posterior surfaces tend to face superiorly and inferiorly; but as the stomach distends, they face progressively more anteriorly and posteriorly (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 63.4</span></a>).</div><section><a id="sf0020"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0020"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000063X/main.assets/f63-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0020"/><a id="fspara0020"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 63.4</span> Axes of the empty and full stomach.

The two major antireflux mechanisms are the tonically contracted, specialized, thickened intrinsic circular smooth muscle of the distal oesophagus, which is reinforced by the extrinsic encircling fibres of the right crus of the respiratory diaphragm. Together, these exert a radial pressure on the lower 2–4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm of oesophagus, creating an effective high-pressure zone (HPZ) that can be measured by electromyography or manometry (<a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Paterson 2001</a>, <a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_26">Mittal and Goyal 2006</a>, <a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Hershcovici et al 2011</a>). The description of the intrinsic muscles of the lower oesophageal sphincter can be refined further to include clasp-like semicircular smooth muscle fibres on the right side of the oesophagus and sling-like oblique gastric muscle fibres on the left side (<a href="#bib59" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_59">Stein et al 1995</a>, <a href="#bib46" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_46">Preiksaitis and Diamant 1997</a>). The distribution of these muscle fibres corresponds to the anatomical and functional asymmetry of the HPZ.</div><div class="text" id="p0140">At and just below the level of entry of the abdominal part of the oesophagus into the stomach, the circular fibres of the intermediate layer of the muscularis externa lying over the upper lesser curvature are particularly pronounced; they are sometimes referred to as ‘clasp’ fibres and exert fairly constant myogenic tone (<a href="#f0030"><span class="bold">Fig. 63.6</span></a>). Since the oesophagus passes obliquely into the stomach, the tone in the clasp fibres rises with increasing gastric distension and these fibres can act to draw the anterior and posterior surfaces together, increasing the tone at the gastro-oesophageal junction and contributing to the HPZ. There are also several minor antireflux factors: the folds of gastric mucosa present at the gastro-oesophageal junction form a mucosal rosette that helps to create a fluid- and gas-tight seal from the basal tonic contraction of the muscular wall of the distal oesophagus; the angle of the cardiac orifice (angle of His), formed in part by the pull of the oblique fibres of the innermost layer of gastric smooth muscle, thereby constituting a type of ‘flap valve’; and the length of the abdominal part of the oesophagus, which is buttressed externally by pads of adipose tissue at and distal to the level of the oesophageal hiatus. These anatomical and physiological features are collectively referred to as the lower oesophageal sphincter. The oesophageal part of the lower oesophageal sphincter is controlled by the intramural plexuses of the enteric nervous system; activation of inhibitory neurones releasing nitric oxide leads to relaxation of the sphincter. Muscle tone is reduced in advance of the oesophageal peristaltic wave during swallowing and raised again after the food bolus has passed. During inspiration, the greater negative intrathoracic pressure increases the gastro-oesophageal pressure gradient, but this is offset by increased pressure in the HPZ from contraction of the peri-oesophageal fibres of the right crus of the respiratory diaphragm. Activation of the crura slightly before the rest of the respiratory diaphragm facilitates this antireflux mechanism.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0030"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000063X/main.assets/f63-06-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0030"/><a id="fspara0030"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 63.6</span> Detail of the arrangements of the muscle layers of the oesophageal and gastric walls. <br/><span class="figcredit">Reproduced and modified from Netter Anatomy Illustration Collection, © Elsevier Inc.

Prolonged episodes of acid reflux as a result of a weak lower oesophageal sphincter or sliding hiatal hernia can cause oesophagitis and its associated complications. Surgical procedures to prevent abnormal reflux are aimed at restoring a normal length of intra-abdominal oesophagus, repairing any hiatal hernia and increasing the pressure surrounding the intra-abdominal part of the oesophagus. This last is usually achieved by wrapping the fundus of the stomach around the intra-abdominal part of the oesophagus (fundoplication).</div><div class="text" id="p0150">The converse type of lower oesophageal sphincter dysfunction occurs in achalasia, which is characterized by reduced or absent ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus of the distal oesophagus and gastro-oesophageal junction. The loss of inhibitory neurones at this site leads to impaired relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter on swallowing, causing dysphagia: oesophageal contraction becomes disorganized, resulting in proximal oesophageal dilatation. Classically, achalasia is characterized by a ‘bird’s beak’ appearance on a barium swallow examination. The dilated oesophagus tapers sharply distally, there is poor oesophageal emptying and a non-relaxing lower oesophageal sphincter. Oesophageal manometry reveals aperistalsis of the oesophagus and a high pressure non-relaxing lower oesophageal sphincter. The main treatment options include surgical myotomy (Heller’s cardiomyotomy), balloon dilatation or botulinum toxin injection, all of which address the hypertonic muscle fibres at the distal end of the oesophagus. Per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has been described as an alternative intervention (<a href="#bib53" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_53">Schlottmann and Patti 2018</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0160"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0120">Barrett’s oesophagus</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0160">Barrett’s oesophagus can be defined as a change in the epithelium of the oesophagus in which any portion of the normal squamous epithelium lining has been pathologically replaced by a metaplastic ‘intestinalized’ columnar epithelium (see <a href="../B9780702077050000847/B9780702077050000847.xhtml#B9780702077050000847">Commentary 1.3</a><span class="icon1"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000021/main.assets/icon03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="icon"/></span>). There is a strong association between gastro-oesophageal reflux and the development of Barrett’s oesophagus, which is also seen more commonly in Caucasian males and obese patients. The abnormal intestinal metaplasia can extend for a variable length proximally from the gastro-oesophageal junction, and associated macroscopic mucosal changes can be seen on endoscopy. The Prague classification is used to document the nature of the Barrett’s oesophagus accurately in terms of its circumferential and maximal extents above the gastro-oesophageal junction.

The pyloric sphincter is formed by a circumferential thickening of circular muscle interlaced with connective tissue septa and some longitudinal muscle fibres, and is palpably thicker than the adjacent stomach and duodenum. The circular pyloric constriction on the surface of the stomach usually indicates the location of the pyloric sphincter, and may be marked by a prepyloric vein (of Mayo) that crosses the anterior surface in a caudal direction.</div><div class="text" id="p0170">Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is due to idiopathic hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the pylorus and causes gastric outlet obstruction in early infancy. It is readily treated by dividing the thickened pyloric muscle (pyloromyotomy) without dividing the pyloric gastric mucosa. Division of the vagal innervation to the pylorus can result in a functional gastric outlet obstruction or delayed gastric emptying; both common sequelae of gastric mobilization and oesophagectomy. To counter this possibility, a pyloroplasty can be fashioned involving full division of the anterior pyloric wall and reconstruction in the counter direction to promote drainage. Historically, pyloroplasty was performed to promote gastric drainage when vagotomy was used to treat peptic ulceration.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0180"/><section><a id="s0185"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0130">Gastric form and internal appearances</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0175">Numerous factors influence both the form and the position of the stomach, including the posture and build of the individual, the extent to which the stomach is filled, the position of the surrounding viscera, and the tone of the abdominal wall and gastric musculature. The empty stomach is most commonly J-shaped; the fundus usually contains air; and in the erect posture, the pylorus descends to the level of the second or third lumbar vertebra. The lowest part of the pyloric antrum can lie distal to the level of the umbilicus, and the overall axis of the organ is slightly inclined from the vertical (<a href="#f0035"><span class="bold">Fig. 63.7</span></a>).

In the abdominal part of the oesophagus, the perforating veins drain into tributaries of the left gastric vein, whereas in the distal thoracic part of the oesophagus, they drain into tributaries of the azygos and hemiazygos venous systems. Bidirectional flow is possible in this region and accommodates pressure changes during breathing and Valsalva manoeuvres.</div><div class="text" id="p0325">Oesophageal and gastric varices are abnormally dilated veins that occur in the submucosal plexus of the distal oesophagus and fundus of the stomach when portal venous pressure is chronically elevated (typically greater than 15<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mmHg). This can arise as a consequence of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, or hepatic portal vein thrombosis, or from a variety of other causes. Portal hypertension leads to the recanalization of occluded embryonic venous channels connecting tributaries of the portal system and the systemic venous circulation (e.g. the round ligament of the liver), and progressive dilation of small, naturally occurring venous anastomoses between portal and systemic venous tributaries (<a href="#bib37" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_37">Paquet 2000</a>). The raised pressure causes the valves within these veins to become incompetent, permitting retrograde flow and the development of varices. Varices in the distal oesophagus are readily visible at endoscopy because they are situated superficially and protrude into the lumen of the oesophagus (<a href="#f0105"><span class="bold">Fig. 63.13</span></a>); they are vulnerable to rupture and are a source of major gastro-intestinal bleeding. Gastric varices can also be present on the inferior aspect of the cardiac orifice. Isolated gastric varices can also develop as a result of splenic vein thrombosis. The close anatomical relationship between the splenic vein and the pancreas means that inflammation or cancers of the pancreas can result in the formation of a thrombus in the splenic vein.

The walls of the gland contain at least five distinct cell types: chief, parietal, mucous neck, stem and neuroendocrine.</div><div class="text" id="p0415">Chief (peptic) cells (see <a href="#f0070">Fig. 63.16</a>) are the source of the digestive enzymes pepsin and lipase. They are usually basal in position and cuboidal in shape, and their nuclei are rounded and euchromatic. They contain secretory zymogen granules and their abundant cytoplasmic RNA renders them strongly basophilic. Parietal (oxyntic) cells are the source of gastric acid and of intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein necessary for the absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. They are large, oval and strongly eosinophilic and have centrally placed nuclei.</div><div class="text" id="p0420">Parietal cells occur intermittently along the walls of the more apical half of the gland but can reach as far as the isthmus; they bulge laterally into the surrounding connective tissue. They have a unique ultrastructure related to their ability to secrete hydrochloric acid. The luminal side of the cell is deeply invaginated to form a series of blind-ended channels (canaliculi) that bear numerous irregular microvilli covered by a plasma membrane rich in H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase antiporter channels. The latter actively secrete hydrogen ions into the lumen; chloride ions <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1170" id="pagebreak_1170"/><a id="pg1170"/>follow along the electrochemical gradient. The mitochondria-rich cytoplasm facing these channels contains a tubulo-vesicular system of abundant fine membranous tubules directed towards the canalicular surface. The precise structure of the cell varies with its secretory phase: when stimulated, the number and surface area of microvilli increases up to five-fold, probably as a result of the rapid fusion of the tubulo-vesicular system with the plasma membrane. This process is reversed at the end of stimulated secretion, when the excess membrane retreats back into the tubulo-alveolar system and microvilli are lost.</div><div class="text" id="p0425">Mucous neck cells are numerous at the necks of the glands and are scattered along the walls of the more basal regions. They are typical mucus-secreting cells, displaying apical secretory vesicles containing mucins and basally displaced nuclei; their products are distinct histochemically from those of the superficial mucous cells.</div><div class="text" id="p0430">Stem cells are relatively undifferentiated mitotic cells from which the other types of gland cell are derived. They are relatively few in number and are situated in the isthmus of the gland and the bases of the gastric pits. Stem cells are columnar and possess a few short apical microvilli. They periodically undergo mitosis; their progeny migrate either apically, to differentiate into new surface mucous cells, or basally, to form mucous neck, parietal, chief or neuroendocrine cells. All of these cells have a limited lifespan, especially the mucus-secreting types, so they are continually replaced. The typical replacement period for surface mucous cells is three days, and that for mucous neck cells is oneweek. Other cell types appear to live much longer.</div><div class="text" id="p0435">Neuroendocrine (enteroendocrine) cells occur in all types of gastric gland but more frequently in the body and fundus of the stomach.

They can also appear in the duodenal mucosa, proximally near the pylorus, in adult tissue.</div></section></section></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0415"/><section><a id="s0420"/><section><a id="s0425"/><section><a id="s0430"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0300">Lamina propria</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0450">The lamina propria forms a connective tissue framework between the glands. It contains small masses of lymphoid tissue, gastric lymphatic follicles, which resemble solitary intestinal follicles (especially in early life). It also contains a complex periglandular vascular plexus involved in maintaining the mucosal environment, e.g. the removal of bicarbonate produced in the tissues as a counterpart to acid secretion, and neural plexuses rich in both sensory and motor terminals.</div></section><section><a id="s0435"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0305">Muscularis mucosae</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0455">The muscularis mucosae is a thin layer of smooth muscle fibres lying external to the layer of glands, arranged as continuous inner circular and outer longitudinal layers and a discontinuous external circular layer.

From innermost outwards it contains oblique, circular and longitudinal layers of smooth muscle fibres (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 63.6</a>). The layers are variably developed in different regions of the stomach and not easily separated. Clasp-like semicircular smooth muscle fibres are present on the right side of the oesophagus and sling-like oblique gastric muscle fibres on the left side; the latter radiate horizontally towards the greater curvature and maintain the angle between the oesophagus and stomach. The circular muscle layer is thicker in the distal pyloric antrum, where it forms the pyloric sphincter. The outer longitudinal layer is most pronounced in the proximal two-thirds of the stomach.</div><div class="text" id="p0470">The muscularis externa enables the stomach to produce churning movements that mix food with the gastric secretions. When the muscles contract they reduce the volume of the stomach and throw the mucosa into longitudinal folds, i.e. gastric folds (see above). Muscle activity is controlled by a network of unmyelinated autonomic nerve fibres and their ganglia, which lie between the muscle layers in the myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus.</div></section><section><a id="s0460"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0320">Interstitial cells of Cajal</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0475">As in smooth muscle elsewhere in the gut, interstitial cells of Cajal are present within the submucosa and muscular layers of the stomach. These spindle-shaped cells contact nerve fibres and form gap junctions with smooth muscle cells, consistent with their role in modulating motor neurotransmission. Interstitial cells of Cajal are involved in generating rhythmic gastric slow-wave contractions and are important in gastric motility. They have been implicated in the pathogenesis of gastric motility disorders such as diabetic gastric paresis (<a href="#bib33" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_33">Negreanu et al 2008</a>) and in the development of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) (<a href="#bib50" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_50">Roggin and Posner 2012</a>). These are uncommon mesenchymal tumours that usually develop in a submucosal location and exhibit a spectrum of clinical behaviour from benign to malignant based upon size and mitotic rate.

This is a safe and effective technique for removing superficial lesions within the upper gastrointestinal tract. The resected specimen can then be assessed histologically. This is important for early oesophageal adenocarcinoma since EMR can be curative for a T1a cancer (which is confined to the mucosa) as the risk of lymph node metastasis is very low, in contrast to a T1b cancer invading the submucosa, when the risk of lymph node metastasis is much greater (various studies show 10–40%) so alternative treatment is required, such as formal surgical resection (oesophagectomy or gastrectomy) and lymphadenectomy (<a href="#bib98" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_98">Ancona 2008</a>, <a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Dubecz et al 2015</a>).

Proximal gastric tone decreases with swallowing (receptive relaxation) and in response to gastric distension (gastric accommodation). Its activity is modulated by enterogastric reflexes (e.g. acid, protein or fat in the duodenum inhibits proximal gastric muscle contraction) and gut hormones (e.g. cholecystokinin, gastrin, glucagon and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide). The vagus nerve plays a key role in these reflexes. In contrast to this activity, the muscle of the distal region of the stomach exhibits strong phasic contractions that increase in amplitude towards the pylorus; these occur about three times per minute and act to grind the food mechanically and propel it towards the pylorus. Solid material lags behind liquids, and when the contents of the pyloric antrum reach the contracted pylorus, only the liquid and small particulate solids can be expelled into the duodenum; larger solid matter is retropulsed back into the stomach for further breakdown (<a href="#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_41">Patrick and Epstein 2008</a>).</div></section></section><footer><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1172.e1" id="pagebreak_1172.e1"/><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebib0010"/><h2 class="reftitle" id="s0485">References</h2><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebibsec0010"/><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib98"><!--<a hreef="#bib_98">98</a>. --><a id="ref0050"/><a href="#bib_98">Ancona</a> E, Rampado S, Cassaro M, et al. <cite>Prediction of lymph node status in superficial esophageal carcinoma</cite>. <cite><i>Ann Surg Oncol</i></cite>. 2008;15:3278–3288.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib88"><!--<a hreef="#bib_88">88</a>. --><a id="nspara1100"/><span class="italic">A study reporting that intramucosal cancers and those invading the upper third of the submucosa are associated with significantly fewer nodal metastases than tumours invading deeper into the submucosa.
