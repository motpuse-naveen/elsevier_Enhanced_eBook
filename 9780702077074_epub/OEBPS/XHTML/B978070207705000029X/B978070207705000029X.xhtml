It has three lobes, anterior, posterior and flocculonodular, 10 lobules (I to X) and a paracrystalline trilaminar histological architecture arranged in parasagittal zones of reciprocal connections with the deep cerebellar nuclei and the inferior olivary nuclei. It is linked with the spinal cord, brainstem and cerebral hemispheres in highly precise topographical relationships, conveyed through the inferior, middle and superior cerebellar peduncles. Mossy fibre afferents from all areas except the inferior olive are conveyed via granule cells and parallel fibres and produce rapid simple spikes in thousands of Purkinje neurones. Climbing fibres arising exclusively from the inferior olivary nuclei arranged in one-to-one relationships with Purkinje neurones produce slow complex spikes; the relationship between these two systems is relevant to cerebellar learning. Monoaminergic afferents arise from the brainstem. This chapter describes the critical anatomy of the essentially uniform architecture of the cerebellar cortex, and its heterogeneous and precisely arranged extracerebellar connections. The anatomical substrates of the cerebellar contribution to motor control, oculomotor and vestibular function, and to intellect and emotion are fundamental to the rapidly advancing fields of cerebellar neurobiology, clinical ataxiology and neuropsychiatry.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">ataxia; cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome; cerebellum; cerebrocerebellar circuitry; deep cerebellar nuclei; olive; peduncles; pons; spinocerebellar tracts; vestibulocerebellum</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0015">The cerebellum is the largest part of the hindbrain, recognized as a distinct division of the brain from the time of Herophilus (335–280 BC) and Galen (AD 131–200).

The cortex is characteristically highly convoluted by numerous transverse furrows of varying depths that separate its surface into lobes, lobules and folia (leaflets). Aggregations of neuronal cell bodies embedded within the white matter form the fastigial (medial), globose (posterior interposed), emboliform (anterior interposed) and dentate (lateral) nuclei, collectively known as the deep cerebellar nuclei.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">An earlier schema of the cerebellum regarded the cerebellum as being divided into three zones of connectional and functional organization (<a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib89" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_89">Jansen and Brodal 1940</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib35" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_35">Chambers and Sprague 1955a</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">1955b</a>). In this approach, the archicerebellum (vestibulocerebellum/flocculonodular lobe) has reciprocal links to vestibular nuclei either directly or indirectly and is concerned with eye movements and equilibrium. The paleocerebellum (spinocerebellum) in the vermis and paravermal regions receive cutaneous and kinaesthetic afferents from the spinal cord. The vermis is linked with the fastigial nucleus and influences the medial motor system through brainstem vestibular and reticular nuclei that send descending projections to the spinal cord, and is important for balance and equilibrium; the paravermal area is linked with the interpositus nuclei that project to the red nucleus and primary motor cortex and influences the lateral motor system which is important for the control of distal limb movements. The neocerebellum (pontocerebellum) is regarded as the lateral part of the cerebellum, receiving descending input from the cerebral cortex, projecting through the dentate nucleus back to thalamic areas that mostly project to motor and premotor cortices, and is important for fine motor control and perhaps motor planning and motor learning. These concepts retain some overall validity, but they have limitations in the light of evolving knowledge. The most salient are that the parasagittal organization of the cerebellum is exponentially more complex than this tripartite division; the anterior lobe–posterior lobe dichotomy of cerebellar function is a major organizing feature; pontine projections are not confined to the cerebellar hemispheres; the cerebellar incorporation into brainstem, diencephalic and cerebrocerebellar circuits extends considerably beyond the sensorimotor domains into the association areas and paralimbic cortices; and there are multiple representations of unimodal, multimodal and transmodal forms of sensorimotor, cognitive and affective systems within the human cerebellum.</div><div class="text" id="p0030">The cerebellum is subdivided into modules, each consisting of a longitudinal cortical zone, a cerebellar or vestibular target nucleus, and a supporting olivocerebellar climbing fibre system. The longitudinal cortical zones are characterized by their connections as well as their immunohistochemical properties. The cerebellum receives topographically highly arranged input from peripheral receptors, spinal cord and brainstem, and from most of the cerebral cortex through two different afferent systems: mossy fibres and climbing fibres. It now appears that a fundamental role of the cerebellum is to enhance function in almost all domains, modulating behaviour, both motor and nonmotor, to optimize performance in a context-dependent manner.</div><div class="text" id="p0035">Ideas on the involvement of the cerebellum in motor functions were derived mainly from movement disorders seen in experimental studies dating back to Rolando and <a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib61" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_61">Flourens (1824)</a> (summarized by <a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib108" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_108">Luciani 1891</a>), and in observations of patients with acquired cerebellar lesions or degeneration (<a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_31">Brown 1892</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib119" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_119">Marie 1893</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Babinski 1899</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib81" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_81">Holmes 1939</a>), who displayed characteristic gait ataxia (unstable balance and walking), dysmetria (disordered control) of the limbs, dysarthria (impaired articulatory clarity), and abnormal oculomotor control.

It is a multiply folded structure; when viewed from the external surface, the fissures (the cerebellar equivalent of cerebral sulci) run horizontally and follow the curve of the cerebellar external surface. The cerebellum has three surfaces. The superior surface adjoins the tentorium cerebelli and projects beyond its free edge: the distinction between the vermis and hemispheres on the superior surface is indistinct, with shallow paramedian kinks in the transverse fissures likely reflecting indentations of the superior cerebellar <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="466" id="pagebreak_466"/><a id="pg466"/>artery. The superior surface slopes gently laterally and posteriorly as it reaches its margins. The transverse sinus borders the cerebellum at the point where the superior and inferior surfaces meet. The inferior surface of the cerebellum is characterized by a massive enlargement of the cerebellar hemispheres, separated from each other medially by a deep groove, or vallecula, which contains the dural falx cerebelli. The posterior vermis is a well-defined anatomical structure when viewed from posterior and inferior, named for its worm-like appearance by Vincenzo Malacarne (1744–1816) (<a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib113" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_113">Malacarne 1776</a>), who also named the uvula and tonsils because of their resemblance to structures in the oral cavity. The posterior vermis is demarcated from the cerebellar hemispheres by deep paramedian sulci, although the hemispheres may extend medially and overlie the vermis. The inferior cerebellar surface lies against the occipital squama. The shape of the anterior cerebellar surface facing the brainstem is irregular, forming the roof of the fourth ventricle and the lateral recesses on each side. The cerebellar peduncles define the diamond shape of the ventricle when viewed from behind.

The lobules are continuous across the midline from one hemisphere to the other. They are distinguished from each other by named fissures, and they are grouped into three lobes: the anterior lobe (lobules I–V), posterior lobe (lobules VI to IX) and the flocculonodular lobe (lobule X) (<a href="#f0130"><span class="bold">Fig. 29.4</span></a>; see <a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 29.3</span></a>).

Lobule I is distinct from lobule II in some human cerebella and in lower primates. The vermal and hemispheric components of lobule I/II together were termed the lingula. The precentral fissure separates lobules I/II from lobule III (centralis) both in the vermis and the hemispheres. Lobule III is partially obscured by lobule IV when viewed from the superior aspect, but it is sizeable, and has a semilunar form with its wing (ala, in prior terminology) extending into the hemispheres on each side. Lobule III is the first distinct folium that is not attached to the anterior medullary velum. The preculminate fissure separates lobule III from lobule IV. The use of the term culmen (including both the vermis and the hemisphere) obscures the fact of the division of the culmen into lobules IV and V by the intraculminate fissure. This fissure is readily discernible on the hemisphere, but at the midline is continuous with a small fissure situated between the branches of a folium. Lobule IV usually contains one folium, and lobule V contains two. The deepest fissure in the vermis that is visible in mid-sagittal section is the primary fissure, which curves ventrolaterally around the superior surface of the cerebellum. It appears early in embryological development and marks the boundary between the anterior lobe (lobules I to V) and the posterior lobe (lobules VI to IX). Specifically, it separates lobule V from lobule VI in the vermis and in the hemisphere. The primary fissure, like other fissures within the anterior lobe, is progressively more difficult to discern on parasagittal sections as one moves laterally, becoming continuous with an undistinguished small fissure in the intermediate sectors of the hemispheres.</div><div class="text" id="p0070">Lobule VI is sizeable and contains two large folia with medullary rays that take their origin off the medullary core. The vermal and hemispheric components of lobule VI have previously received different names: in the vermis, lobule VI was called the declive, and in the hemisphere it was called the lobulus simplex, among others.</div><div class="text" id="p0075">The superior posterior fissure appears early in development and is visible on the superior surface of the cerebellum separating lobule VI from lobule VII. Vermal lobule VII is complex; its lateral extension in the hemispheres into what Lodewjck Bolk (1866–1930) called the ansiform lobule, forms a large part of the hemisphere in the human cerebellum. The massive expansion through evolution of the human cerebellum is a reflection in large part of the expansions of lobules VI and VII. The terms folium and tuber have been used to denote vermis lobule VII, but this fails to convey the complexity of their equivalent hemispheric extensions, as below.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">The horizontal fissure appears relatively late in embryological development. It is prominent in the hemisphere, extending around the dorsolateral border of each hemisphere from the middle cerebellar peduncle to the vallecula, separating the superior and inferior surfaces. The horizontal fissure divides lobule VII into two sectors, with important differences in their hemispheric extensions. Vermal lobule VIIAf (identical to the folium) expands laterally to form crus I (of Bolk’s ansiform lobule, formerly known as the superior semilunar lobule). Vermal lobule VIIAt (formerly called the rostral half of the tuber of the vermis) is continuous in the hemispheres with crus II (of Bolk’s ansiform lobule, formerly known as the inferior semilunar lobule). The horizontal fissure therefore separates lobule VIIAf from VIIAt in the vermis, and crus I from crus II in the hemisphere. In some brains, lobule VIIAf may not be discernible at the midline, in which case the superior posterior fissure is bounded caudally by the ansoparamedian and not the horizontal fissure.</div><div class="text" id="p0085">The ansoparamedian fissure can be traced across the midline separating lobule VIIAt and crus II from vermal and hemispheric lobule VIIB (previously termed the paramedian, or gracile lobule). The ansoparamedian fissure is not symmetrical in the hemispheres in all brains. The horizontal and ansoparamedian fissures sometimes meet on the posterior inferior cerebellar surface, so that crus II appears as a triangular lobe situated on the superior and posterior aspects of the posterior lobe, and on lateral parasagittal sections, crus I is adjacent to lobule VIIB. When the horizontal and ansoparamedian fissures do not meet, crus II continues laterally and forward onto the anterior surface of the cerebellum, and on lateral parasagittal sections crus II is adjacent to VIIB. These details are relevant for precise mapping of the human brain and can affect intra-and inter-individual functional mapping studies. Even when the folia at the lateral inferior cerebellar surface are asymmetric across the two hemispheres, they can be seen to be derived from medullary rays that are morphologically similar.</div><div class="text" id="p0090">Lobule VIIIA and VIIIB in the vermis were formerly known as the pyramis, and in the hemispheres as the biventer. Thus, the prepyramidal/prebiventer fissure separates lobule VIIB from VIIIA and is named according to whether the lobule VIIB/VIIIA distinction is in the vermis (prepyramidal fissure) or hemisphere (prebiventer fissure). The intrapyramidal/intrabiventer fissure separates lobule VIIIA from VIIIB. The secondary fissure is interposed both at the vermis and in the hemispheres between lobules VIIIB and IX. In earlier terminology, vermal lobule IX is referred to as the uvula, and hemisphere lobule IX as the tonsil, and subsequently as the ventral paraflocculus (equivalent to the dorsal paraflocculus in monkeys). In the human, the folial loop of lobule IX is directed medially, contrary to the situation in most mammals, where the paraflocculus arches laterally. Note that the term cerebellar tonsil refers to a grossly visible anatomical structure at the inferior and medial cerebellum which is of great relevance in clinical neurology and neurosurgery (tonsillar herniation, Chiari malformation). Although the tonsil was previously equated with lobule IX, it also incorporates folia within lobule VIIIB, which means that the term is anatomically imprecise.</div><div class="text" id="p0095">The posterolateral fissure separates lobules IX from X, and forms the boundary between the posterior lobe of the cerebellum and the flocculonodular lobe. Vermal lobule X (nodulus) is the last of the vermis divisions. Where its cortex ends it forms the attachment (taenia) of the ependymal roof of the fourth ventricle. Hemispheric lobule X (flocculus) is a small cerebellar lobule adjacent to the caudal surface of the middle cerebellar peduncle. It is located in the roof of the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle, and dorsal to the cochlear nuclei and the vestibulocochlear nerve which are ventral to the recess. Hemispheric lobule X appears as a double folial rosette; its dorsal leaf is known as the accessory paraflocculus of Henle (the ventral paraflocculus in monkeys), its ventral leaf represents the true flocculus. Between vermal lobule X (nodulus) and hemispheric lobule X (flocculus and accessory paraflocculus), the cortex is absent and the tissue is stretched out as the posterior medullary velum (inferior medullary velum) which forms the infero-posterior part of the fourth ventricle. The internal surface of the posterior medullary velum is the ventricular ependyma; its outer surface is covered by pia mater.</div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0035">Cerebellar peduncles</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0100">Three pairs of peduncles connect the cerebellum with the brainstem (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 29.7</span></a>).

The juxtarestiform body is mainly an efferent system, made up almost entirely of Purkinje cell axons destined for the vestibular nuclei and uncrossed fibres from the fastigial nucleus.

It passes obliquely from the basal pons to the cerebellum and contains the massive pontocerebellar mossy fibre pathway, composed almost entirely of fibres that arise from the contralateral basal pontine nuclei, with a small addition from nuclei in the pontine tegmentum.</div><div class="text" id="p0110">The superior cerebellar peduncle (brachium conjunctivum) contains all the efferent fibres from the dentate, emboliform and globose nuclei, and a small fascicle from the fastigial nucleus. Fibres from the globose nucleus occupy a medial position; those from the emboliform and dentate nucleus are successively more lateral. Axons in the extreme ventrolateral portion of the peduncle arise from the superior vestibular nucleus and relay excitation from the anterior semicircular canal to the oculomotor nucleus (the excitatory vestibulo-ocular relay). Nucleo-olivary fibres of the interposed and dentate nuclei are located in a separate bundle, ventral to the peduncle. The superior cerebellar peduncle, including its nucleo-olivary component, decussates in the caudal mesencephalon (the decussation of the brachium conjunctivum). The decussation consists of dorsal and ventral portions. The dorsal portion contains fibres that occupy the medial two-thirds of the peduncle and start to cross the midline at the level of the inferior colliculus, ventral to the medial longitudinal fasciculus. The ventral portion contains fibres that occupy the lateral third of the peduncle, and decussate in the ventral tegmentum, immediately dorsal to the interpeduncular nucleus. Rostrally, at the level of the caudal red nucleus, the ventral and dorsal portions of the decussation merge and the entire decussation is displaced ventrally by the dorsal tegmental (tectospinal) decussation. After its decussation the peduncle divides into descending and ascending branches. The descending branch terminates in the medial reticular formation of the pons and the medulla and in the reticulotegmental nucleus (nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, NRTP). The nucleo-olivary fibres join the descending branch to terminate in the inferior olive in a strict orderly manner (see below). The much larger ascending branch distributes to the mesencephalon and the diencephalon; the red nucleus and the thalamus are its main targets. The fibres of the superior cerebellar peduncle always decussate to the opposite hemisphere, except in rare developmental disorders of axonal guidance (<a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib179" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_179">Spampinato et al 2008</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0115">The superior cerebellar peduncle also conveys afferents to the cerebellum that arise in the spinal cord and course in the ventral spinocerebellar tract.

It is an irregularly folded sheet of neurones, resembling a crumpled leather purse with a medially directed opening. The convolutions of the dentate nucleus are narrow rostromedially (microgyric) and contain large neurones, whereas the much wider ventrocaudal (macrogyric) part contains smaller neurones. This is important from the perspective of anthropology as well as cognitive neuroscience and behavioural neurology (see below). The dentate nucleus surrounds the hilum, a mass of efferent fibres arising from dentate neurones that forms the bulk of the superior cerebellar peduncle.</div><div class="text" id="p0140">The cerebellar nuclei contain three types of neurones. Multipolar neurones have different sizes, with long ramifying dendrites and an axon that leaves the cerebellum through the superior cerebellar peduncle, the uncinate tract or the juxtarestiform body. These provide glutamatergic, excitatory input to the brainstem, thalamus and spinal cord. Some collaterals of these efferent axons enter the cerebellar cortex, where they terminate sparsely as mossy fibres. A population of small, inhibitory neurones gives rise to the pathway terminating in the contralateral inferior olive, the nucleo-olivary projection (<a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib133" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_133">Nelson et al 1989</a>), travelling mostly in the superior cerebellar peduncle.

Local inhibitory interneurones in the cerebellar nuclei contain glycine, often colocalized with GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid). Purkinje cell axons are the main input to the neurones of the cerebellar nuclei: there are GABAergic inhibitory synapses on both dendrites and somata.

In contrast to the cerebral cortex, obvious local differences and architectonic heterogeneity do not occur and, with a few exceptions, different areas of the cerebellar cortex are largely indistinguishable. The same homogeneity is present throughout all mammals and, with only minor differences, throughout the vertebrates. The cerebellar cortex has three main layers, a Purkinje cell layer interleaved between the overlying molecular layer and the granule cell layer beneath. The three layers are interconnected by a complex circuitry with an architecture that is essentially invariant throughout. Cerebellar functional topography is entirely explained by the arrangement of the fibres that connect the cerebellum to other regions of the central nervous system.

Approximately 90% of the Purkinje cell dendritic tree consists of terminal branches containing about 180,000 spines (<a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib62" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_62">Fox and Barnard 1957</a>). They are not uniformly distributed: proximal first and second order dendrites have smooth surfaces with short, stubby spines which are contacted by climbing fibres, whereas distal branches have a dense array of short-necked dendritic spines on which the terminals of parallel fibres synapse. This differential proximal vs distal Purkinje cell spine density is under dual control: an intrinsic mechanism that promotes spine growth over the entire dendritic tree, and activity-dependent spine pruning by the climbing fibre at the proximal dendrite.</div><div class="text" id="p0165">The subcellular structure of a Purkinje cell is essentially similar to that of other neurones. A distinguishing feature is the presence of subsurface cisterns below the plasmalemma of the soma and dendrites; these may penetrate into the spines and are often associated with a mitochondrion. The cisterns represent intracellular calcium stores which are important links in the second messenger systems of the cell. Excitatory (asymmetrical) synapses of the climbing fibres contact the proximal spines of the spiny branchlets; parallel fibres contact the distal spines of the spiny branchlets. Excitatory synapses are rare on the soma of a Purkinje cell. Inhibitory (symmetrical) synapses from basket cell axons and stellate cells and recurrent collaterals of the Purkinje cell axon contact the shafts of the proximal dendrites. The non-synaptic area of the surface of the soma and dendrites of a Purkinje cell is covered by lamellar protrusions of the Bergmann glial fibres.</div><div class="text" id="p0170">The Purkinje cell axon arises from the pole opposite the dendrites and traverses the granular layer into the subjacent white matter.

The main axon descends into the white matter and forms a plexus in the deep cerebellar nuclei and, in the case of lobule X, the vestibular nuclei. Recurrent collateral branches of Purkinje axons form plexuses above and below their somata. These collaterals are orientated in the same plane as the Purkinje cell dendritic tree and the inhibitory synapses from basket and stellate cells. Purkinje cell axon recurrent collaterals terminate on neighbouring Purkinje neurones and on basket and Golgi neurones. Purkinje cells are inhibitory and use GABA as their main neurotransmitter, as well as the neuropeptides motilin, cerebellin and CGRP. They are the only efferent neurone of the cerebellar cortex and project to the deep cerebellar or vestibular nuclei.</div></section><section><a id="s0050"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0065">Molecular layer</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0175">The molecular layer is about 300–400<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm thick.

The Golgi dendritic tree is unlike that of the Purkinje, basket or stellate cell, which is flattened and confined to a single plane, but instead has a three-dimensional configuration, appearing much the same in transverse and longitudinal foliar sections. In both planes, the Golgi dendritic tree overlaps the territories of several Purkinje cells and neighbouring Golgi cells.

Eight or nine of the modules can be recognized in the cerebellum of nonhuman primates and lower mammals (see <a href="#f0100">Fig. 29.36</a>).

Posterior parietal projections arise from both gyral and sulcal cortices, including the multimodal caudal regions. Inferior parietal lobule projections to the pons are predominantly rostral, whereas those from the superior parietal lobule are seen throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the pons. These parietal projections are mostly in the intermediate and lateral sectors of the pons, with a degree of topographical organization determined by their site of origin. Temporal lobe projections arise from the multimodal regions of the cortex of the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus, as well as from the superior temporal gyrus and supratemporal plane, and terminate in the lateral and dorsolateral pontine regions. Parastriate cortices at the dorsomedial and dorsolateral convexity, as well as the posterior parahippocampal gyrus, project to the lateral and dorsolateral pontine regions in a pattern that interdigitates with the other terminations in this area. The rostral cingulate cortex projects to medial pontine nuclei and the caudal cingulate cortex projects to more lateral regions. Pontine projections have also been shown in experimental retrograde studies to arise from the anterior insular cortex.</div><div class="text" id="p0520">These connections provide the cerebellum with access to higher order information, enabling it to modulate cognitive and emotional processing.</div><div class="text" id="p0525">There is a dichotomy in the pattern of corticopontine projections according to the dorsal (‘where’ pathway) versus ventral streams (‘what’ pathway) of cognitive processing. Dorsal stream areas concerned with visual motion and the peripheral visual field (the dorsal part of the prelunate gyrus, caudal lower bank of the cortex in the superior temporal sulcus, polymodal convergence zones in the lower bank of the cortex in the intraparietal sulcus, and paralimbic parts of the caudal inferior parietal lobule, as well as dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices concerned with spatial features of working memory) have projections to the pons. In contrast, in anatomical studies in monkeys, ventral stream cortices concerned with visual feature discrimination and the central visual field (ventral prelunate gyrus, rostral lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus, middle and inferior temporal gyri, lateral aspects of the posterior parahippocampal gyrus, and ventral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices with which these areas are interconnected) do not send projections into the basis pontis. These connections in monkeys suggested that the cerebellum plays a role in spatial awareness, and in attentional, auditory and linguistic functions subserved by the dorsal stream of cognitive processing.

The F2 and F4 zones connect with oculomotor neurones that subserve the horizontal canal vestibulo-ocular reflex. The flocculus and ventral paraflocculus receive vestibular mossy fibre input, relaying an efferent copy of the output of the vestibulo-oculomotor neurones. They also receive climbing fibre input, signalling retinal slip that occurs when the stabilization of the retina by the vestibulo-ocular reflex is incomplete. Retinal slip is perceived by two groups of neurones in the mesencephalon. In the horizontal plane, it is relayed by the nucleus of the optic tract. This nucleus, located in the pretectum, receives fibres of the contralateral optic nerve via the optic tract and projects to the dorsal cap of the inferior olive, located dorsomedial to the caudal medial accessory olive (see <a href="#f0095">Fig. 29.35</a>). The dorsal cap provides the F2 and F4 zones with climbing fibres. Retinal slip in the plane of the anterior canal is conveyed by the lateral and medial nuclei of the accessory system, part of a group of nuclei located on the periphery of the rostral mesencephalon that receive optic nerve fibres from the accessory optic tract (an offshoot of the optic nerve). These nuclei project to the ventrolateral outgrowth of the inferior olive, located immediately rostral to the dorsal cap (see <a href="#f0095">Fig. 29.35</a>). The ventrolateral outgrowth innervates the F1 and F3 zones. Repeated simultaneous activation of the vestibular mossy fibre-parallel fibre input and the climbing fibres, relaying retinal slip, induces plastic changes in the Purkinje cell output that compensates for the retinal slip. Combinations of the horizontal and anterior canal systems ensure compensation of retinal slip in all possible planes. Knowledge of this system has been instrumental in the concept that climbing fibres are carriers of error signals used in cerebellar learning (<a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib121" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_121">Marr 1969</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib85" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_85">Ito 1982</a>).</div><div id="p0595"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0215"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000029X/main.assets/on29-18-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0215"/><a id="fspara0215"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 29.40</span> The circuitry used by the flocculus in long-term adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR).

Pcn nucleus projections include the parahippocampal gyrus. These thalamic projections to higher order association areas originate not only in the dentate nucleus but also from parts of the interposed and fastigial nuclei (see <a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib152" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Schmahmann 1996</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0725">Trans-synaptic tract tracing studies using attenuated viral tracers further defined the feedback limb, showing that the morphological distinction between the phylogenetically older, dorsal magnocellular part of the dentate nucleus, and the more recently evolved ventral small-celled region have connectional and functional relevance.

Cerebellar lesions do not produce weakness but resting motor tone in pure cerebellar disease is decreased (hypotonic).</div><div class="text" id="p0805">The somatotopy identified in experimental animal models and in functional imaging studies in healthy humans is reflected in structure–function correlation studies using voxel-based morphometry and lesion symptom mapping in patients with focal cerebellar lesions. Patients with lesions to the anterior cerebellar lobe and vermis often present with ataxia that may affect speech and deglutition, core muscles of the trunk and movement of their upper and lower limbs.</div><div class="text" id="p0810">Speech is slurred, syllables are poorly articulated, cadence is slow and irregular, and rapid alternating buccal, palatal and lingual consonants are degraded. Dysarthria is compounded by impaired volume control, which is inconstant and not well modulated. Scanning speech was an older term to describe cerebellar dysarthria, but it does not fully capture the range of the characteristic deficits. Dysarthria in cerebellar developmental disorders differs in quality from that of the acquired and neurodegenerative ataxias, with a persistent childlike quality, as well as impaired prosody (the use of vocal intonation, stress and cadence). Cerebellar disorders affect the control of breathing, and ataxic respiration further degrades the quality of speech. Impaired control of the muscles of deglutition predisposes to dysphagia (impaired swallowing), causing choking on liquids and solids and the risk of aspiration pneumonia.</div><div class="text" id="p0815">Truncal ataxia occurs with midline lesions, including titubation, or oscillation of the head and trunk. The patient with cerebellar ataxia has a widened stance and difficulty standing. In mild instances there is inability to stand in the tandem position, and in progressively more severe ataxia, inability to stand with the feet in parallel, or in the natural position, eventually needing to hold on to stationary objects or another person in order to stand. The cerebellar ataxic gait is staggering, uneven, irregular, and veers from side to side. Unilateral lesions cause stumbling towards the affected side.</div><div class="text" id="p0820">Dysmetria (Greek, disordered timing or measurement) refers to the impaired ability to judge, regulate and control behaviour. It applies to both the motor and cognitive domains. Upper limb dysmetria is identified with tests such as the finger to nose test, or rapid finger following/mirror test, rapid alternating movements, and tests of finger dexterity such as tapping the index finger on the crease of the thumb. These reveal inaccurate and clumsy movements, jerking trajectory, overshooting (hypermetria) and undershooting the target (hypometria), oscillation at the fingers and wrists as well as more proximally at the elbows and shoulders when more severe, as well as overshoot, rebound and dysdiadochokinesis (dysrhythmic attempts at rapid alternating movements). Finger and hand dexterity for compound movements involving more than one joint are particularly affected. Lower limb dysmetria tested with the heel-to-shin test, reveals proximal overshoot as the heel is placed on the opposite knee, tremor of the heel on the knee, and slowing, jerking, or side-to-side movements as the heel moves down the shin. The attempt to draw a circle in the air with the legs is degraded by decomposition manifested as irregular or chaotic motions.</div><div class="text" id="p0825">Postural tremor may be present in the arms, usually with activation.

It stabilizes the position of the retina in space during movements of the head by rotating the eyeball in the opposite direction. It is an open reflex, meaning that there is no time for a feedback connection that would compensate for inaccuracies in the execution of the reflex. This function is undertaken by the long-term adaptation of the reflex by the flocculus. The circuitry of the flocculus, similar to the vestibuloocular reflex, is organized on the coordinate system of the semicircular canals (<a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib178" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_178">Simpson and Graf 1981</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Barmack and Yakhnitsa 2013</a>). The vestibulo-ocular reflex consists of different components. One component connects the lateral (horizontal) semicircular canal, via oculomotor neurones in the vestibular nuclei, with the oculogyric muscles that move the eyes in a plane colinear with the plane of the lateral canal (see <a href="#f0215">Fig. 29.40</a>). The anterior semicircular canal influences the ipsilateral superior oblique and the contralateral inferior oblique muscles that move the eye in the plane of this canal.</div><div class="text" id="p0855">Stroke in the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery results in infarction of the vestibulocerebellum–flocculonodular region and lobule IX, producing abrupt-onset severe vertigo (sensation of movement in the absence of stimulus), almost always with nausea and vomiting. The vertigo makes it impossible to walk at the time of the acute event, but if the cerebellar motor areas are not damaged, there is no dysmetria of the limbs or dysarthria. Oculomotor abnormalities from cerebellar lesions produce visual disturbances including diplopia, oscillopsia and a sense of dysequilibrium. The range, complexity and varying combinations of oculomotor abnormalities on examination include deficits in gaze holding, reflex pursuit eye movements, voluntary initiation and direction of saccadic eye movements, and spontaneous or gaze-evoked nystagmus. The condition of isolated downbeat nystagmus, linked to a potassium channelopathy of the flocculonodular system, produces a cautious and unstable gait, likely a result of mismatched visual–vestibular interaction. Opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome is a dramatic impairment of oculomotor control with chaotic eye movements in horizontal and vertical directions in primary position, a heralding sign of a paraneoplastic syndrome that may be observed in neoplasms such as hypernephroma of the kidney in children, and the anti-Yo antibody syndrome directed at Purkinje cells in Hodgkin’s lymphoma and breast, ovarian and lung carcinomas.</div></section><section><a id="s0210"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0200">Cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0865">The cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) is characterized by impairments in executive function (planning, set-shifting, abstract reasoning, verbal fluency, working memory), often with perseveration, distractibility or inattention; visual–spatial disorganization and impaired visual–spatial memory; difficulties with language production including dysprosodia, agrammatism and mild anomia (<a href="../B978070207705000029X/B978070207705000029X_split_a.xhtml#bib167" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Schmahmann and Sherman 1998</a>).
