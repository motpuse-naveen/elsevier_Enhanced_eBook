Except at the sites of the uncovertebral (neurocentral) joints of Luschka, disc outlines correspond with the adjacent bodies. Their thickness varies in different regions and within individual discs. Each disc consists of an outer lamellated anulus fibrosus and an inner nucleus pulposus (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0165">Fig. 46.54A</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0895">In cervical and lumbar regions the discs are thicker anteriorly, contributing to the anterior convexity of the vertebral column. In the thoracic region they are nearly uniform, and the anterior concavity is largely due to the vertebral bodies. Discs are thinnest in the upper thoracic region and thickest in the lumbar region. They adhere to thin layers of cartilage on the superior and inferior vertebral surfaces, the vertebral end-plates. The latter do not reach the periphery of the vertebral bodies but are encircled by ring apophyses. The end-plates contain both hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage. The fibrocartilaginous component lies nearer to the disc and is sometimes considered not to be part of the end-plate itself. The fibrocartilaginous components of the end-plates above and below the nucleus pulposus, together with the innermost lamellae of the anulus fibrosus, form a flattened sphere of collagen that surrounds and encloses the nucleus (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_split_a.xhtml#f0340"><span class="bold">Fig. 46.60</span></a>). The overall proportion of fibrocartilage in the end-plate increases with age. While all discs are attached to the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments, discs in the thoracic region are additionally tied laterally, by intra-articular ligaments, to the heads of ribs articulating with adjacent vertebrae. Intervertebral discs form about one-quarter of the length of the postaxial vertebral column; cervical and lumbar regions make a greater contribution than the thoracic and are thus more pliant.</div><div id="p0910"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0340"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000046X/main.assets/on46-23-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0435"/><a id="fspara0450"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 46.60</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, The structure of the vertebral end-plate: the collagen fibres of the inner two-thirds of the anulus fibrosus sweep around into the vertebral end-plate and form its fibrocartilaginous component.

Its lamellae, which are convex peripherally when seen in vertical section, are incomplete collars. The internal vertical concavity of the lamellae conforms to the surface profile of the nucleus pulposus. In all quadrants of the anulus, about half the lamellae are incomplete; the proportion increases in the posterolateral region. The exact nature of the interlamellar substance remains in some doubt. Posteriorly, lamellae join in a complex manner. Fibres in the rest of each lamella are parallel and run obliquely between vertebrae at about 65° to the vertical (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0165">Fig. 46.54A</a>). Fibres in successive lamellae cross each other obliquely in opposite directions, thus limiting rotation. The obliquity of fibres in deeper zones varies in different lamellae. Posterior fibres may sometimes be predominantly vertical, which possibly predisposes them to herniation.</div><div class="text" id="p0915">This standard description of the anulus may not apply at all spinal levels; a cadaveric study indicates that the anulus is usually incomplete posteriorly in adult cervical discs (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_41">Mercer and Bogduk 1999</a>) (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0165">Fig. 46.54A</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0630"/><p class="h8hd" id="cesectitle0455">Nucleus pulposus</p><div class="textfl" id="p0920">The nucleus pulposus is better developed in cervical and lumbar regions and lies between the centre of the disc and its posterior surface. At birth it is large, soft and gelatinous, and is composed of mucoid material. It contains a few multinucleated notochordal cells and is invaded by cells and collagen fibres from the inner zone of the adjacent anulus fibrosus. Notochordal cells disappear in the first decade, and the mucoid material is gradually replaced by fibrocartilage, <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="838" id="pagebreak_838"/><a id="pg837.e1"/>derived mainly from the anulus fibrosus and the plates of hyaline cartilage adjoining the vertebral bodies. The nucleus pulposus becomes less differentiated from the remainder of the disc as age progresses, and gradually becomes less hydrated and increasingly fibrous. The type II collagen of the nucleus becomes more like the type I of the anulus as its fibril diameter increases. The quantity of aggregated proteoglycans in the nucleus decreases, while the keratan sulphate/chondroitin sulphate ratio increases. As increased cross-linking occurs between collagen and the proteoglycans, the discs lose their water-binding capacity and become stiffer and more liable to injury. Contrary to what was previously thought, it has now been shown that lumbar discs do not decrease in overall height as a part of normal ageing. The anulus gradually loses height as its radial bulge increases, but the nucleus retains height and may increase in convexity as it increasingly indents the end-plate. Loss of trunk height with age results from a decrease in vertebral body height (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Bogduk 2012</a>).

Normal discs are otherwise avascular and are dependent for their nutrition on diffusion from vertebral bone beneath adjacent end-plates and from the peripheral anulus. Vascular and avascular parts differ in their reaction to injury. Venous drainage is via the external and internal vertebral venous plexuses to the intervertebral veins and thence to the larger named veins that drain the vertebral column. Lymphatic drainage of the vertebral column is briefly considered above.

The outer third of the anulus is innervated by the sinuvertebral nerves; each sinuvertebral nerve supplies both the disc at the level of its spinal nerve of origin and the disc one level above. The anterior part of the anulus is supplied by the sympathetic (preganglionic, grey ramus communicans) rather than by the mixed nerve. In damaged and degenerate discs, the nerves may penetrate more centrally into the disc substance. The sinuvertebral nerves are condensations within extensive nerve plexuses that lie on the posterior longitudinal ligament. Similar plexuses have been demonstrated anteriorly, covering the anterior longitudinal ligament, and laterally in the fetus.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0345"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000046X/main.assets/f46-41-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0185"/><a id="fspara0185"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 46.61</span> Innervation of a lumbar intervertebral disc.

The posterolateral surface of the disc forms the anterior boundary of the intervertebral foramen on each side, and so is closely related to the spinal nerve and its accompanying vessels. More centrally, the disc is related posteriorly to the dura mater covering the spinal cord and the cauda equina. Anterior relations of the discs vary considerably with vertebral level, but important ‘at risk’ structures include the pharynx and oesophagus, the descending aorta and <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="839" id="pagebreak_839"/><a id="pg838.e1"/>the inferior vena cava. Laterally, relations change with level, but the parietal pleura in the thorax, and the sympathetic trunk and psoas muscles in the lumbar region, are important examples.</div></section><section><a id="s0655"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0480">Prolapsed intervertebral disc</p><div class="textfl" id="p0950">A prolapsed intervertebral disc most commonly affects the 20–55-year age group and is most often seen at the L4/L5 and lumbosacral levels. It may also affect the cervical discs, particularly at C5/C6 and C6/C7. The thoracic discs are rarely affected. Acute tearing or chronic degeneration of the posterior lamellae of the anulus fibrosus allows deformation and herniation of the disc contents. The disc most often prolapses just lateral to the posterior longitudinal ligament and can compress one or two spinal nerves unilaterally (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_split_a.xhtml#f0350"><span class="bold">Fig. 46.62</span></a>). Much less commonly, the prolapse is central, in the midline posteriorly. The compression of neural structures may then be bilateral, affecting the cord itself or the whole cauda equina. If the damaged anulus ruptures completely, some of the nuclear tissue may escape into the vertebral and ‘root’ canals. This sequestrated material may migrate within the canals and cause nerve compression at spinal levels distant from that of the disc rupture. The disc material itself may have an irritative effect on the spinal nerve.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0350"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000046X/main.assets/f46-42-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0190"/><a id="fspara0190"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 46.62</span> Left posterolateral disc extrusion. <span class="bold">A</span>, Axial view. <span class="bold">B</span>, Sagittal view.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0955">Regarding the anatomy of the vertebral canal and intervertebral foramen in relation to disc prolapse, it is important to understand that one or both of two spinal nerves and their roots may be affected by a single prolapse, depending on the exact site of the prolapse in the horizontal plane. At the level of each disc and foramen, there are two spinal nerves (and their roots) to consider: these are the exiting nerve and the traversing nerve (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_split_a.xhtml#f0420"><span class="bold">Fig. 46.63</span></a>) (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">MacNab and McCulloch 1990</a>). The nerve usually affected at lumbar levels is the traversing nerve, which crosses the back of the disc on its way to become the exiting nerve at the level below. Thus a lumbosacral (i.e. L5/S1) disc prolapse usually compresses the S1 nerve. However, a prolapse may affect the exiting nerve at its own level. This is especially likely if the prolapse is in the extraforaminal zone of the ‘root’ canal, the so-called ‘far lateral’ prolapse. At cervical levels, because the roots and nerve leave the vertebral canal almost horizontally, the prolapse usually affects the exiting nerve. This nerve will still bear the number of the vertebra below the affected disc because cervical nerves exit the canal above the pedicle of their numerically corresponding vertebra. Neurological presentation will include signs and symptoms of spinal nerve damage at the affected level. Thus pain and sensory loss will be dermatomal in distribution. Sensory changes usually precede motor loss.</div><div id="p0970"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0360"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000046X/main.assets/on46-24-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0445"/><a id="fspara0465"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 46.63</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, Exiting and traversing nerve roots.

The dorsal raphe lies superficially <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="844" id="pagebreak_844"/><a id="pg844"/>along the posterior midline of the neck.

The fascicles pass inferiorly and slightly laterally. Those from the first four lumbar vertebrae converge on to a common flat tendon that covers the lateral surface of the muscle and separates it from the lumbar fibres of iliocostalis, for which reason it is called the lumbar intermuscular aponeurosis. The aponeurosis commences in the mid-lumbar region, with a broad irregular base, and inferiorly it tapers to a truncated point that inserts into the medial surface of the ilium just dorsal to the ala of the sacrum. The fascicle from the first lumbar vertebra attaches rostrally and dorsally to the aponeurosis. Successive fascicles attach to it more ventrally and caudally. The fascicle from the fifth lumbar vertebra inserts separately, deep to the intermuscular aponeurosis, into the ventromedial aspect of the ilium and the upper fibres of the dorsal sacroiliac ligament. Medially, the lumbar fibres of longissimus are separated from the multifidus by a wide cleavage plane filled with fat and veins.</div><div class="text" id="p1415">The thoracic part consists of fascicles with small, fusiform muscle bellies that have short rostral tendons and long caudal tendons. The muscle bellies are arranged in a tiered fashion across the length of the posterior thoracic wall, with the highest lying medially and the lowest lying laterally. The upper four fascicles arise from the tips of the first four thoracic transverse processes. The succeeding fascicles have bifid tendons that arise from the transverse process and the adjacent rib at each of the lower eight thoracic segments. The long caudal tendons of the thoracic fascicles of longissimus are aggregated in parallel to form a wide aponeurosis, which allows them to assume a variety of caudal insertions. The tendons of the uppermost fascicles insert into the lumbar spinous processes and their supraspinous ligament. Those from the first thoracic segment reach the L1–L2 level, and those from the sixth thoracic segment reach the L5 level. The fascicles from the seventh to ninth thoracic segments reach the median sacral crest, and those from the tenth and eleventh thoracic segments attach transversely across the posterior surface of the third segment of the sacrum. The fascicle from the twelfth thoracic segment reaches the sacrum and dorsal segment of the iliac crest just below where the intermuscular aponeurosis of the lumbar fibres of longissimus inserts into the ilium.

They insert into the medial end of the iliac crest and the dorsal segment of the iliac crest, with the fascicle from L4 assuming the most ventral and lateral attachment, and the fascicle from L1 assuming the most dorsal and medial attachment. The attachment to the ilium is largely by fleshy fibres but the more superficial fibres are aponeurotic. The thoracic part consists of eight or nine small fascicles that respectively arise from the lower eight or nine ribs at their angles, lateral to the iliocostalis thoracis. Each fascicle arises from its rib by a ribbon-like tendon. The tendons are longer at high levels but become progressively shorter at lower levels. The muscle bellies of the fascicles are uniform in length, and each gives rise to a caudal tendon. These tendons are aggregated to form a dorsal aponeurosis that covers the lumbar part of iliocostalis lumborum and inserts in a linear fashion into the medial end of the iliac crest and its dorsal segment.

This movement is initiated by flexor muscles, such as rectus abdominis, in order to bring the centre of gravity of the trunk forwards. Thereafter, erectores spinae control the descent of the thorax under gravity. When the trunk is fully flexed, many parts of erector spinae cease to contract and become electromyographically silent. In this position, flexion is limited by passive tension in the back muscles, and tension in the thoracolumbar fascia, the posterior spinal ligaments and the intervertebral discs. Similarly, lateral flexion under gravity is controlled by the contralateral erector spinae, with input from the oblique abdominal muscles.</div><div class="text" id="p1470">The function of the cervical and capital components of erector spinae has not been determined. These are small muscles with very little force capacity, and are poorly orientated to exercise extension or to control flexion of the head or cervical spine.

There are seven pairs of these muscles, the highest between the atlas and axis, and the lowest between the seventh cervical vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra; the anterior muscles between atlas and axis are often absent. In the thoracic region, intertransversarii consist of single muscles that span between the transverse processes of the last three thoracic and the first lumbar vertebrae.

Movements of the entire lumbar spine can be measured using skin-surface techniques, but the results are of limited clinical use because there is high inter- and intra-observer variation (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib52" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_52">Pearcy et al 1984</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib53" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_53">Pearcy and Tibrewal 1984</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1625">The intervertebral discs are the principal sites of vertebral column movement. Conversely, at most levels, the extent to which the discs may be deformed is also the limiting factor for motion. Bony deformation in the subchondral bone and articular cartilage may contribute to movement. Regional variations in mobility of the spine depend on the geometry, orientation and properties of the facet joints and related ligamentous complexes. Physiological intervertebral movements usually combine tilting (bending) and gliding (shear), so the instantaneous centre of rotation moves continually during the movement. During flexion and extension of the lumbar vertebrae, the centre of rotation usually lies near the centre of the intervertebral disc when viewed in the transverse plane, close to the superior end-plate of the vertebra below.</div><div class="text" id="p1630">The oblique and ovoid articular surfaces of the facet joints ensure that spinal movements in different planes are usually ‘coupled’ to a certain extent. For example, lateral flexion would cause impingement of the articular surfaces on that side, leading to a posteriorly directed force on the upper vertebra that would act to rotate it about its long axis. Physiologically, coupled movements are variable. Although movements between individual vertebrae are small, their summation gives a large total range to the vertebral column in flexion, extension, lateral flexion and axial rotation. Each pair of vertebrae with its interposed disc and ligaments is termed a motion segment or functional spinal unit.</div><div class="text" id="p1635">In flexion, the anterior longitudinal ligament becomes relaxed as the anterior parts of the intervertebral discs are compressed. At its limit, the posterior longitudinal ligament, ligamenta flava, interspinous and supraspinous ligaments, and the posterior fibres of the intervertebral discs are all tensed, the interlaminar intervals widen, the inferior articular processes glide on the superior processes of subjacent vertebrae, and their capsules become taut. Tension of extensor muscles is also important in limiting flexion, e.g. when carrying a load on the shoulders. Flexion is effectively absent in the thoracic region. In forward flexion of the lumbar spine, the muscles normally protect the osteoligamentous spine from injury. However, the margin of safety can be compromised during repetitive or sustained bending by a failure of the spinal reflexes. Once the muscle protection is lost, flexion injury affects first the interspinous ligaments and then the capsules of the facet joints. The ligamentum flavum has such a high content of elastin that it is always under tension, and can be stretched by 80% without damage. This ligament probably functions to provide a constant smooth lining to the vertebral canal, which is never overstretched in flexion and which never goes slack in extension.</div><div class="text" id="p1640">In extension, the opposite events occur and there is compression of posterior discal fibres. Extension is limited by tension of the anterior longitudinal ligament, anterior discal fibres and impaction of spines or articular processes. It is marked in cervical and lumbar regions, and much less at thoracic levels, partly because the discs are thinner, but also because of the presence of the ribs and chest musculature. In full extension, the axis of movement passes posterior to the disc, moves forwards as the column straightens and passes into flexion, and reaches the centre of the intervertebral disc in full flexion.</div><div class="text" id="p1645">In lateral flexion, which is always combined with ‘coupled’ axial rotation, intervertebral discs are laterally compressed and contralaterally tensed and lengthened, and motion is limited by tension of antagonist muscles and ligaments. Lateral movements occur in all parts of the column but are greatest in cervical and lumbar regions.</div><div class="text" id="p1650">Axial rotation involves twisting of vertebrae relative to each other with accompanying torsional deformation of intervening discs. About 50% of cervical rotation occurs at the atlanto-axial joint. Elsewhere in the column, although movement is slight between individual vertebrae, the range summates to become considerable for the column as a whole. In the postcervical column, the effective range of rotation is greatest at the thoracolumbar junction. There is very little rotation in the remainder of the lumbar region.</div><div class="text" id="p1655">In the cervical region, the upward inclination of the superior articular facets allows free flexion and extension. The latter is usually greater, and is checked above by locking of the posterior edges of the superior facets of C1 in the occipital condylar fossae, and below by slipping of the inferior processes of C7 into grooves inferoposterior to the first thoracic superior articular processes. Flexion stops where the cervical convexity is straightened, checked by apposition of the projecting lower lips of vertebral bodies on subjacent bodies. Cervical lateral flexion and rotation are always coupled, and the superomedial inclination of the superior articular facets imparts rotation during lateral flexion.</div><div class="text" id="p1660">Cervical motion can be considered to involve the upper (i.e. the atlanto-occipital and atlanto-axial complexes) and the lower cervical spine (C3–C7). Two physiological movements take place at the atlanto-occipital joints: those of flexion–extension and lateral flexion. The atlanto-axial joints allow flexion–extension and rotation. Some studies have suggested that maximum flexion–extension occurs between the occiput and C1; however, <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Frobin et al (2002)</a> noted between 12.6° and 14.5° at this level, which is less than at some of the other cervical levels.

Lack of upward inclination of the superior articular facets prohibits much flexion, and extension is checked by contact of the inferior articular margins with the laminae and of adjacent spines. Thoracic rotation is freer, though limited by the ribs at upper levels. Its axis is in the vertebral bodies in the mid-thoracic region, and in front of them elsewhere, so that rotation involves some lateral displacement. The direction of articular facets would allow free lateral flexion but this is limited in the upper thoracic region by the resistance of the ribs and sternum. Rotation is usually combined with slight lateral flexion to the same side.</div><div class="text" id="p1670">Movement in the thoracic spine is frequently regionalized to upper, mid- and lower thoracic. In the upper thoracic, flexion ranges from 7.8° to 9.5°, increasing to 10–11.4° in the mid-thoracic and 12.5–12.8° in the lower thoracic (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib71" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_71">Willems et al 1996</a>).

Lateral flexion is greater in the lower thoracic spine, ranging from 5.6° to 6.2° in the upper thoracic, 7.9° to 8.1° in the mid-thoracic and 11.9° to 13.2° in the lower thoracic. However, rotation is greatest in the mid-thoracic region, being 11.8–15.9° in the upper thoracic, 21.5–25.3° in the mid-thoracic, and 8.3–11.8° in the lower thoracic.</div><div class="text" id="p1675">Flexion movements are generally greater than extension or lateral flexion in the lumbar region. Axial rotation occurs about a centre of rotation in the posterior anulus, and is limited by bony contact in the facet joints after only 1–2° of movement. Functional transition between thoracic and lumbar regions is usually between the eleventh and twelfth thoracic vertebrae, where the facet joints usually fit so tightly that slight compression locks them, and prevents all movements but flexion.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="850" id="pagebreak_850"/><a id="pg850"/></div><div class="text" id="p1680">During flexion of the lumbar spine there is an unfolding or straightening of the lumbar lordosis. Thus in full flexion the lumbar spine assumes a straight alignment or is curved slightly forwards. Normal ranges of global lumbar flexion are 58° to 72° in those under 40 years old and 40° to 60° in the over-forties; females exhibit a reduced range compared with males (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Dvorak et al 1995</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">McGregor et al 1995</a>). At an intersegmental level, the L3/L4 junction and L4/L5 junction exhibit the greatest mobility – approximately 12° and 13° respectively, while at the lowest level (L5/S1) there is only 9°, and at the upper lumbar levels only 8° and 10°, respectively (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib52" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Pearcy et al 1984</a>).

At an intersegmental level, L5/S1 and L1/L2 exhibit the greatest mobility at approximately 5°, while the remaining levels exhibit less than 5° of extension. Ranges of lateral flexion and rotation in the lumbar spine are reduced compared to other regions of the spine. Global lateral flexion ranges from 20° to 35°, and rotation ranges from 25° to 40°; the ranges of both movements are reduced with age. Assessment of intersegmental rotation and lateral flexion has proven difficult because of the limitations of measurement techniques.</div><section><a id="s1320"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0975">Role of musculature</h3><div class="textfl" id="p1685">Although muscles will move the spinal column, the majority of muscular activity is involved in providing stability to maintain posture and to provide a firm platform for limb function. Hence the concept of ‘core stability’ in modern rehabilitation programmes, especially in sports-related problems.</div><div class="text" id="p1690">It is important to recognize the way in which the muscles of the back work in conjunction with those of the abdominal wall, particularly the oblique and transversus muscles, and with those of the lower limbs. The erector spinae group and internal abdominal oblique and transversus abdominis are anatomically and functionally connected by the thoracolumbar fascia (which encloses the former, and into which the latter are inserted). This fascia, together with collagenous tissue within the back muscles, plays an important role in resisting forward bending of the trunk, and during manual handling. The fascia is tensioned primarily by flexing the trunk, although this tension may be enhanced slightly by the lateral pull of the abdominal muscles. It is functionally advantageous to generate tension in the fascia and muscle sheaths because the elastic strain energy stored in these stretched tissues can be used to help bring the trunk to an upright position and so reduce the metabolic cost of the movement (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_1">Adams et al 2006</a>). The thoracolumbar fascia may also have an important function in transferring load between the trunk and the lower limbs; tension in the fascia can be increased by the actions of gluteus maximus and the hamstrings as well as by trunk flexion.</div><section><a id="s1325"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0980">Muscles producing vertebral movements</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1695">The spinal column is moved both directly by muscles attached to it, and indirectly by muscles attached to other bones.

Much of the stability of the vertebral column depends on dynamic muscular control but there are also bony and ligamentous ‘static’ stabilizers. There is considerable variation between segments of the column in terms of stability and mobility; the most mobile levels are the least stable. The latter are those in which the ratio of intervertebral disc height to vertebral body height is highest. Stability may be compromised by damage to any of these structures.</div><div class="text" id="p1705">Trauma may affect any vertebral region. Levels of specialized mobility (e.g. atlanto-axial joint) and the junctions of mobile and relatively fixed regions (e.g. cervicothoracic, thoracolumbar) are particularly vulnerable to severe structural damage, often accompanied by spinal cord and nerve injury. Injuries of the vertebral column may affect purely soft tissue (ligaments, joint capsules and muscles) or may affect bony structures (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_split_a.xhtml#f0405">Fig. 46.58</a>). Pure ligamentous/capsular injuries leading to instability may be particularly difficult to diagnose in the absence of gross radiological signs. In the cervical spine, subluxation and dislocation of the facet joints commonly occur without or with minimal bony injury because of the orientation of the articular facets (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_split_a.xhtml#f0370">Fig. 46.65</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1710">Chronic infections of many types (e.g. tuberculosis) may involve the vertebrae and lead to their deformity and collapse, affect their mechanical properties and compromise their neuroprotective function. Acute infections, spreading locally or via the blood stream, may lead to the collection of pus within the vertebral canal, causing spinal cord compression (epidural abscess).</div><div class="text" id="p1715">The integrity of the vertebrae may also be affected by malignant disease, most commonly metastatic. Vertebrae have a copious blood supply throughout life, and many of the common cancers (e.g. breast, bronchus) spread via the arterial system. Cancers of the haemopoietic system (e.g. multiple myeloma) also commonly affect the vertebrae. Prostatic carcinoma has a predilection to metastasize to the vertebral column, often using the venous (Batson’s plexus) rather than the arterial route (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_6">Batson 1957</a>). Metastatic deposits may occur within the epidural space, compressing the contents of the dural sac at multiple levels.</div><div class="text" id="p1720">Systemic inflammatory diseases may cause both deformity and instability of the vertebral column. Rheumatoid arthritis inflames facet joints and weakens ligaments, leading to instability, especially in the cervical spine (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0320">Fig. 46.57</a>). Ankylosing spondylitis and other seronegative arthritides affect joints and ligamentous attachments (entheses), leading to ectopic ossification of collagenous structures, fusion (ankylosis) of interbody and facet joints, and loss of the normal spinal curvatures. Widespread new bone formation at and around the joints of the column occurs in DISH (diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis). Such conditions would seem to increase stability of the column, at the expense of its mobility and function, but an ankylosed spine is very liable to fracture, with an associated risk of neural damage <span class="bold">(</span><a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_split_a.xhtml#f0455"><span class="bold">Fig. 46.79</span></a> <span class="bold">).</span></div><div id="p5850"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0445"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000046X/main.assets/on46-29-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0475"/><a id="fspara0500"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 46.79</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, A sagittal CT reconstruction showing a T8–T9 distraction extension injury in the setting of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.

Earlier views regarding the relative importance of the disc-body complex and the posterior elements have proved somewhat simplistic. Clinical observation led to the ‘three-column concept’ of spinal stability, in which the column is divided into three longitudinal parts rather than two (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Denis 1983</a>). The anterior column is formed by the anterior longitudinal ligament, the anterior half of the vertebral body and the anterior anulus fibrosus. The middle column is made up of the posterior longitudinal ligament, the posterior half of the vertebral body and pedicles, and the posterior anulus fibrosus. The posterior column consists of the vertebral arch and facet joints and the posterior ligamentous complex. The more columns that are affected, the worse is the instability; an injury to two columns is usually unstable.</div><div class="text" id="p1735">Although regarded as the most influential system for classifying thoracolumbar spinal injuries, the concept was criticized for oversimplifying the biomechanics of injury. A more recent classification system, aided by improved computed tomographic imaging and magnetic resonance imaging, stresses the importance of the posterior ligamentous complex in determining the stability of the injured spine in addition to the morphology of the injury (compression, translational/rotational or distraction injuries) and the neurological status of the patient (intact, nerve root injury, complete or incomplete spinal cord injury, cauda equina syndrome) (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib30" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_30">Lee et al 2005</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1740">The elastic deformability of intervertebral discs permits tilting and axial rotation between vertebral bodies, and also helps to reduce vertical accelerations of the head. The main shock-absorbing mechanism of the column stems from the spinal curves, which increase and decrease slightly during locomotion against the restraining tension of the trunk muscles. The elastic strain energy in the stretched tendons of the muscle is responsible for shock absorption.</div><div class="text" id="p1745">Both body height and spinal stability are subject to a marked diurnal variation. Body height is affected by changes from recumbency to the upright posture. These diurnal variations appear to be due to changes that occur within the cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions of the spine. Investigations using stereophotogrammetry have demonstrated that 40% of diurnal changes occur in the thoracic spine and affect the degree of kyphosis, and a further 40% in the lumbar spine, but do not affect the lordosis (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib72" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_72">Wing et al 1992</a>). The greatest change in vertebral column length is found in adolescents and young adults. The height loss occurs within 3 hours of rising in the morning, with an overall loss of about 15<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm.</div><div class="text" id="p1750">Although the curvatures within the vertebral column contribute to the changes in height, changes within the intervertebral disc contribute both to observed height loss and to variation in stability. Magnetic resonance imaging investigations reveal a dynamic movement of fluid into and out of an intervertebral disc and adjacent vertebral body over a 24-hour period. Body position affects the movement of fluid. In the early morning, the discs are swollen with water, the intervertebral ligaments and the anulus fibrosus are taut, and the intrinsic bending stiffness and stability of the osteoligamentous spine are relatively high. After several hours of normal activity, the discs lose approximately 20% of their water and height. This change makes the ligaments slack and greatly reduces the bending stiffness of the spine, so that relatively more of the stability of the spine must then be provided by the musculature. The diurnal expulsion of water from intervertebral discs also affects the distribution of compressive loading in the spine. As the day progresses, the hydrostatic pressure in the nucleus pulposus falls, and stress concentrations arise in the anulus fibrosus and facet joints.</div><div class="text" id="p1755">All ligaments of the column, as well as the facet joint capsules, are important in the maintenance of stability. The anterior longitudinal ligament is very strong, and resists translational displacement (shear) of the vertebrae as well as extension. All the ligaments of the posterior complex resist flexion and rotation, and their integrity determines the range of movements allowed. These ligaments can support the whole column when the muscles are inactive, e.g. in quiet standing. At the limit of lumbar flexion, the column is supported mainly by the thoracolumbar fascia and by collagenous tissue within the electrically silent muscles of the back.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="851" id="pagebreak_851"/><a id="pg850.e1"/></div><div class="text" id="p1760">Movements are both determined and constrained by the shape and orientation of the facet joints, whose articular surfaces stabilize the column primarily by resisting horizontal gliding (shear) movements and axial rotation. In the most mobile regions, the joint surfaces are flatter and more horizontally placed, as will become apparent if a typical cervical facet joint is compared with a typical lumbar joint.</div><div class="text" id="p1765">Certain regions of the vertebral column are further stabilized by additional extraspinal factors. The thoracic spine is stabilized by its position as an integral part of the thoracic cage and by its strong ligamentous linkages with the ribs. The sacrum is effectively a virtually fixed integral element of the bony pelvis.</div><div class="text" id="p1770">The contribution to stability conferred by the musculature has been grossly underrated. The whole vertebral column is stabilized by the ‘guy-rope’ or staying effect of the long muscles that attach it to the girdles, the head and the appendicular skeleton. This effect is particularly marked for erector spinae, which controls global posture and movement. The small and deep muscles of the back are best able to resist shear movements between vertebrae because only they have sufficient angulation to the long axis of the vertebral column to do this effectively. The deep muscles can also fine-tune intervertebral movements.</div><div class="text" id="p1775">For most back problems in clinical practice, especially chronic low back pain, enhancing muscle strength, stamina and coordination with the many other muscle groups that contribute to stability, e.g. pelvic girdle muscles, is the most appropriate and effective therapeutic avenue. Only a minority of cases benefit from surgery. Furthermore, iatrogenically damaging the neurovascular supply and neglecting the musculature may explain the relatively high failure rates from surgery. Minimally invasive spine surgery with emphasis on the preservation of soft tissue and muscle envelope may be a useful adjunct in maintaining spinal stability.</div><div class="text" id="p1780">Mechanical injury to the vertebral column may be produced by flexion, extension, distraction, rotation, shear or compression; movements that cause damage are commonly combined, e.g. flexion, axial rotation and compression.</div></section><a id="s1335"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0990">Posture and Ergonomics</h2><div class="textfl" id="p1785">Posture is a descriptive term for the relative position of the body segments during rest or activity.

The position of the line of gravity may move anteriorly with locomotion and may vary between individuals.</div><div class="text" id="p1795">The normal curvature of the cervical spine is a lordosis.

However, this curve or kyphosis can become exaggerated to give the impression of a rounded back. Poor posture and ergonomics can lead to this exaggerated curvature but other important causes include tuberculosis, a wedge or compression fracture of a vertebral body, Scheuermann’s osteochondritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoporosis and metastatic carcinoma.</div><div class="text" id="p1805">The lumbar spine is held in a lordosis. The degree of this lordosis is determined by the lumbosacral angle and is normally 30–45°. The muscles responsible for this posture include erector spinae, rectus abdominus, the internal and external abdominal obliques, psoas major, iliacus, the gluteal and hamstring muscles. The lordosis can be increased (as a result of weak abdominal muscles and tight hamstring muscles), decreased, flattened (common in people with either acute or chronic low back pain) or reversed.</div><div class="text" id="p1810">A common postural deviation seen throughout the spine is scoliosis or lateral curvature of the spine. It can be structural, compensatory or protective. In structural scoliosis, the lateral curvature is associated with vertebral rotation, and both the curve and the rotation become more accentuated on forward flexion. Such a scoliosis is common in adolescent girls and its cause is unknown. Various factors have been proposed as common causes including various genetic and hereditary factors (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">Latalski et al. 2017</a>). It may also be secondary to an underlying disorder, e.g. muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy or spina bifida. A compensatory scoliosis occurs when the pelvis is tilted laterally, e.g. as a result of unequal leg length or a fixed abduction or adduction deformity at the hip joint. Usually there is no intrinsic abnormality of the spine itself and the scoliosis disappears when the pelvic tilt is corrected. A sciatic or antalgic scoliosis is a temporary deformity produced by the protective action of muscles in certain painful conditions of the spine.</div><div class="text" id="p1815">Spinopelvic balance refers to an ideal spinal alignment that would allow an individual to maintain a standing posture with minimal expenditure of energy (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib58" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_58">Schwab et al. 2009</a>).

Pelvic tilt is defined as the angle between the vertical and a line through the midpoint of the sacral plate to femoral heads axis. It often reflects a compensatory mechanism: when the spine tilts forward (age- related change, loss of lordosis, increase of kyphosis) an individual will try his/her best to maintain an economic posture and to keep the spine as vertical as possible (i.e. bring the spine over the pelvis). By increasing the pelvic tilt through pelvic retroversion, spinopelvic balance may be maintained, but eventually this may lead to increased fatigue and pain. If decompensation occurs, standing with a forward stooped posture is likely.</div><div id="p5815"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0450"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000046X/main.assets/on46-30-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0480"/><a id="fspara0505"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 46.80</span> Analysis of the pelvis in the sagittal plane is commonly assessed with three angular measurements: pelvic tilt, sacral slope and pelvic incidence.

If too little lordosis is created, there may be continued pain or decompensation because appropriate spinopelvic balance has not been achieved.</div><section><a id="st0020"/><div class="pageavoid"><p class="tnum">TABLE 46.3</p><div class="big_device"><table id="t0020" class="tbody"><caption class="ttitle"><a id="tspara0020"/>Normative values of pelvic parameters on adult population (mean ± SD)</caption><thead><tr><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">Age group (years)</th><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">Pelvic incidence (°)</th><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">Pelvic tilt (°)</th><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">Sacral slope (°)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope="row" class="tb">21–40</th><td class="tb">52 ± 10</td><td class="tb">13 ± 7</td><td class="tb">39 ± 9</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="tb">41–60</th><td class="tb">53 ± 8</td><td class="tb">14 ± 6</td><td class="tb">40 ± 7</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="tb">&gt;60</th><td class="tb">51 ± 9</td><td class="tb">16 ± 9</td><td class="tb">36 ± 9</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="small_device"><p class="table_fig"><img src="B978070207705000046X_t0020_0.png" alt="image"/></p></div><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="8521" id="pagebreak_8521"/></div><p class="b1source">With permission from Schwab F, Lafage V, Patel A et al 2009 Sagittal plane considerations and the pelvis in the adult patient.

When sitting with the hips and knees flexed to 90°, the pelvis rotates posteriorly, flattening the lumbar lordosis and consequently increasing the load on the intervertebral discs. Thus it is now advised that, in sitting, the angle between trunk and thigh should be between 105° and 135°, with the sacrum tilted at 16° and the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae supported.</div><div class="text" id="p1840">In lifting heavy weights, there is considerable initial compression of lumbar intervertebral discs, and large increases in thoracic and intra-abdominal pressure. The compressive force acting on the spine is shared between the vertebral bodies and the vertebral arch. In the lumbar spine, the vertebral arch typically resists 20% of this force once the disc height has been reduced by diurnal fluid expulsion, and when the spine is positioned upright. However, age-related narrowing of the disc can cause more than 50% of the compressive force to be resisted by the vertebral arch, which may explain why osteoarthritis of the facet joints commonly follows disc degeneration.</div><div class="text" id="p1845">When lifting, manual handling advisers emphasize the importance of leg lifting as opposed to back lifting. Loads should also be kept close to the body to reduce the lever arm of the load. The use of deep inspiration to raise intra-abdominal pressure while lifting has also been advised, as this is believed to offer further support to the lumbar spine. The spine is at risk when lifting is combined with twisting, lateral bending and asymmetric postures. However, heavy lifting remains one of the key work-related risk factors for the spine together with whole-body vibration, prolonged sitting, twisting and bending.</div><a id="s1340"/><hgroup><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0995">Surface Anatomy</h2><h3 class="h2after1" id="cesectitle1000">Skeletal landmarks</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle1005">Vertebral spines</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s1345"/><section><a id="s1350"/><div class="textfl" id="p1850">A furrow runs along the posterior median line from the external occipital protuberance above to the intergluteal cleft (anal cleft, natal cleft) below (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0250"><span class="bold">Figs 46.81</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0255"><span class="bold">46.82</span></a>). The furrow is bordered laterally by muscles attaching to, and acting upon, the vertebral column; it is deepest in the mid-lumbar region and shallowest in the distal cervical region. Inferiorly, it widens out into a flattened, triangular area, with an inferior apex that lies at the start of the intergluteal cleft and corresponds approximately to the spinous process of S3. Palpation of the median furrow reveals the sagittal curves of the vertebral column (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0255">Fig. 46.82</a>): the cervical curve is convex anteriorly (lordosis) and extends from the C1 to the T2 vertebra; the thoracic curvature is concave anteriorly (kyphosis) and extends from the T2 to the T12 vertebra; and the lumbar curvature is convex anteriorly and extends from the T12 vertebra to the lumbosacral prominence. The external occipital protuberance is subcutaneous and is palpable on the postero-inferior aspect of the cranium in the midline, especially when it is approached from below. The inion is the most prominent part of this protuberance. The tubercle on the posterior arch of C1 (atlas) is impalpable, whereas the transverse process of C1 is palpable as an indistinct mass through sternocleidomastoid just inferior to the apex of the mastoid process. The spinous process of C2 is the first palpable feature in the median furrow, located several centimetres inferior to the inion (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0250">Fig. 46.81B</a>). The tips of the spinous processes of C3 to C6 are more difficult to palpate because the overlying ligamentum nuchae forms a palpable raised midline ridge, especially when the neck is flexed. The ligamentum nuchae terminates inferiorly at the spinous process of C7 (vertebra prominens), which is the most <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="852" id="pagebreak_852"/><a id="pg852"/>superior visible projection in this region. The spinous process of T1 is palpable immediately inferior to that of C7 and is usually more prominent. Identification of the remaining spinous processes of the thoracic vertebrae is not easy, even in a thin subject when the trunk is fully flexed, because they overlap one another in the mid-thoracic region. In the upper and mid-thoracic regions, the tips of the spinous processes lie level with the superior part of the bodies of the vertebrae immediately below, whereas in the lower thoracic region, they lie either opposite the inferior part of their own vertebral body, or the intervertebral disc articulating with the vertebra immediately below (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_split_a.xhtml#t0025">Table 46.4</a>). The tips of the spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrae can usually be palpated without difficulty, especially if the trunk is flexed. Each lies opposite the inferior part of its own vertebral body and the intervertebral disc articulating with the vertebra below.

Careful palpation may be necessary to identify the vertebral spinous processes in this position. The spinous processes of the sacral vertebrae are smaller and less well defined than those of the other vertebrae.

The ascending (lower) fibres are best seen when an erect individual pushes both hands against a wall with their elbows extended.</div><div class="text" id="p1885">Latissimus dorsi occupies the lower half of the back. It passes from the spinous processes of the lower six thoracic vertebrae, the thoracolumbar fascia and the posterior iliac crest, to the posterior axillary fold. In lean individuals, with the arm adducted against resistance, the inferolateral border can easily be traced to the iliac crest. The upper border passes horizontally from the spinous process of T7 to the inferior angle of the scapula and then on to the posterior axillary fold.</div><div class="text" id="p1890">The triangle of auscultation (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0215">Figs 46.71</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0255">46.82</a>) lies between the upper border of latissimus dorsi, the lower inferolateral border of trapezius and the inferomedial border of rhomboid major, although for simplicity the medial border of the scapula is often substituted for the latter muscle.</div><div class="text" id="p1895">The inferior lumbar (Petit’s) triangle (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0215">Figs 46.71</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0255">46.82</a>), one of the sites of a rare primary lumbar hernia, lies inferiorly just lateral to the highest point of the iliac crest, between the inferolateral border of latissimus dorsi, the posterior free border of external abdominal oblique and the iliac crest. The corridor bordered by the triangle is used to enter the retroperitoneal space: the fascia covering the triangle is detached from the iliac crest and the retroperitoneal space can be entered.</div></section><section><a id="s1375"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle1030">Clinical Examination</h2><div class="textfl" id="p1900">Clinical examination of the back of the trunk and neck best follows the order of inspection, palpation and movement. The examination will be determined by the circumstances of presentation and by the history, and may include musculoskeletal, neurological and vascular observations. Information relevant to the neurological and vascular examination of the skin and material relating to spinal movements and deeper innervation are found above. Palpation of the region involves careful assessment of the bony and musculotendinous landmarks described above, looking in particular for asymmetry, deformity and tenderness. Note that, apart from the spinous processes, most of the bony elements of the vertebrae and almost all of the intervertebral joints are not palpable from behind. In regions of lordosis (sagittal plane curves of the spine with anterior convexity, i.e. mid-cervical and mid- and lower <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="854" id="pagebreak_854"/><a id="pg854"/>lumbar), parts of the vertebral column can often be palpated anteriorly with care in well-relaxed, thin subjects. .Examination of the spine requires a careful neurological exam, and may also involve manoeuvres that assess neurology in relation to potential anatomical derangements. For example, the straight leg raise stretches caudal lumbar spinal nerve roots and exacerbates pain in the presence of caudal lumbar pathology such as an L4–L5 or L5–S1 intervertebral disc herniation. Examination of other joints such as the hip or shoulder is also important when examining the spine because pain related to these structures may present similar to radiculopathy and other spinal problems. A careful history and examination of the spine along with neurological and orthopaedic examination should allow the clinician to be fairly certain of the spinal localization of pathological processes.</div></section></body></html>
