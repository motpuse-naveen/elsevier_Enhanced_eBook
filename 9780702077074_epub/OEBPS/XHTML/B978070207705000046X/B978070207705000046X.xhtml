In the thoracic region, the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="815" id="pagebreak_815"/><a id="pg815"/>thoracolumbar fascia provides a thin fibrous covering for the extensor muscles of the vertebral column and separates them from the muscles connecting the vertebral column to the upper extremity. Medially, it is attached to the spines of the thoracic vertebrae, and laterally to the angles of the ribs. In the lumbar region, the thoracolumbar fascia is in three layers (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0035"><span class="bold">Fig. 46.6</span></a>; see <a href="../B9780702077050000616/B9780702077050000616.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 61.1</a>). The posterior layer is attached to the spines of the lumbar and sacral vertebrae and to the supraspinous ligaments. The middle layer is attached medially to the tips of the lumbar transverse processes and the intertransverse ligaments, below to the iliac crest, and above to the lower border of the twelfth rib and the lumbocostal ligament. The anterior layer covers quadratus lumborum and is attached medially to the anterior surfaces of the lumbar transverse processes behind the lateral part of psoas major; below, it is attached to the iliolumbar ligament and the adjoining part of the iliac crest; above, it forms the lateral arcuate ligament. The posterior and middle layers unite to form a tough raphe at the lateral margin of erector spinae, and at the lateral border of quadratus lumborum they are joined by the anterior layer to form the aponeurotic origin of transversus abdominis. At sacral levels, the posterior layer is attached to the posterior superior iliac spine and posterior iliac crest, and fuses with the underlying erector spinae aponeurosis. <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Bogduk (2012)</a> describes two laminae in the posterior layer at lumbar levels, with varying orientation of the constituent collagen fibres relating to the biomechanical function of the fascia.

The fascia may also play an important role in load transfer between the trunk and the limbs: its tension is affected by the actions of latissimus dorsi, gluteus maximus and the hamstrings. Additionally, the thoracolumbar fascia contains nociceptive nerve endings that may be responsible for some forms of back pain. Other mechanisms related to the thoracolumbar fasciae that have been implicated as a possible source of back pain include tissue deformation due to injury or immobility, resulting in impaired proprioceptive signalling and possibly an increase in pain sensitivity, and increased sensitivity of the thoracolumbar fascia in conditions involving other tissues innervated by the same spinal nerve (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib69" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_69">Willard et al 2012</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0045">Deep cervical fascia</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0075">The investing layer of the deep cervical fascia forms the deep fascia of the posterior aspect of the neck (see <a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355.xhtml#f0025">Fig. 35.4A</a>).

The upper one, faintly marked and often almost imperceptible, is the highest nuchal line, and the lower one is the superior nuchal line. The epicranial aponeurosis is attached to the medial part of the highest nuchal line.

A wide groove with raised banks, the superior sagittal sulcus, ascends from the protuberance to the superior angle of the squamous part. The posterior part of the falx cerebri is attached to the margins of the sulcus. A prominent internal occipital crest descends from the protuberance and bifurcates near the foramen magnum, and provides an attachment for the falx cerebelli. The occipital sinus, sometimes double, lies in this attachment. A small vermian fossa may exist at the lower end of the internal occipital crest; when present, it is occupied by part of the inferior cerebellar vermis. On each side, a wide sulcus for the transverse sinus extends laterally from the internal occipital protuberance; the tentorium cerebelli is attached to the margins of these sulci. The right sulcus is usually larger than the left, and passes into the sulcus for the superior sagittal sinus, whereas the left usually receives the straight sinus.

A condylar fossa, behind each condyle, fits the posterior margin of the superior facet of the atlas vertebra in full extension of the skull. Its floor is sometimes perforated by a posterior condylar canal for a sigmoid emissary vein. A quadrilateral plate, the jugular process, projects laterally from the posterior half of each condyle, and contributes the posterior part of the jugular foramen. The jugular process is indented in front by a jugular notch, which may be partly divided by a small intrajugular process projecting anterolaterally. A paramastoid process sometimes projects downwards and may even articulate with the transverse process of the atlas vertebra. Laterally, the jugular process has a rough quadrilateral or triangular area that is joined to the jugular surface of the temporal bone by cartilage; it begins to ossify at around 25 years.</div><div class="text" id="p0135">An oval jugular tubercle overlies the hypoglossal canal on the superior surface of the occipital condyle.

Each presacral segment (except the first two cervical) is separated from its neighbour by a fibrocartilaginous intervertebral disc. The functions of the column are to support the trunk, to protect the spinal cord and nerves, and to provide attachments for muscles. It is also an important site of haemopoiesis throughout life. Its total length in males is about 70<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm and in females about 60<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm. The intervertebral discs contribute about one-quarter of this length in young adults, though there is some diurnal variation in this contribution. Approximately 8% of overall body length is accounted for by the cervical spine, 20% by the thoracic, 12% by the lumbar and 8% by the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="819" id="pagebreak_819"/><a id="pg819"/>sacrococcygeal regions. Although the usual number of vertebrae is 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and 4 coccygeal, this total is subject to frequent variability, and there have been reports of variation between 32 and 35 bones. The demarcation of groups by their morphological characteristics may be blurred: thus there may be thoracic costal facets on the seventh cervical vertebra, giving it the appearance of an extra thoracic vertebra; lumbar-like articular processes may be found on the lowest thoracic vertebra; or the fifth lumbar vertebra may be wholly or partially incorporated into the sacrum. As a result of these changes in transition between vertebral types, there may be 23–25 mobile presacral vertebrae.</div><section><a id="s0135"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0100">Anterior aspect</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0170">The anterior aspect of the column is formed by the anterior surfaces of the vertebral bodies and of the intervertebral discs (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0055">Fig. 46.9A</a>).

It is particularly flexible and, if dissected free from the body, it can easily be bent (flexed or extended) into a perfect half-circle. A slight sacral curvature can be seen, which develops as the sacral vertebrae ossify and fuse. The thoracic part of the column is the first to develop a relatively fixed curvature, which is concave anteriorly. An infant can usually support its head at 3 or 4 months, sit upright at around 9 months, and will commence walking between 12 and 15 months. These functional changes exert a major influence on the development of the secondary curvatures in the vertebral column and changes in the proportional size of the vertebrae, in particular in the lumbar region. The secondary lumbar curvature becomes important in maintaining the centre of gravity of the trunk over the legs when walking starts, and thus changes in body proportions exert a major influence on the subsequent shape of curvatures in the vertebral column.</div></section><section><a id="s0170"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0135">Adult curvatures</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0215">In adults, the cervical curve is a lordosis (convex forwards), and the least marked.

It extends from the lumbosacral junction to the apex of the coccyx.</div><div class="text" id="p0220">The presence of these curvatures means that the cross-sectional profile of the trunk changes with spinal level.

Compensatory lateral curvature may also develop to cope with pelvic obliquity, such as that imposed by inequality of leg length. The sagittal curvatures are present in the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and pelvic regions (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0055">Fig. 46.9</a>).

This leads to progressive decline in vertebral column mobility, particularly in the lumbar spine. The development of a ‘dowager’s hump’ in the mid-thoracic region in females, caused by age-related osteoporosis, increases the thoracic kyphosis and cervical lordosis. Overall, these changes in the vertebral column lead directly to loss of total height in the individual.</div><div class="text" id="p0230">As discs desiccate, there is often a straightening of the cervical spine and development of subsequent cervical kyphosis.

The spinal branch (SB) sends prominent posterior central branches (PCB) to the dorsum of the body, whereas the dorsal branch (DB) supplies the anterior (ALB) and posterior (PLB) laminar branches. Neural branches (NB) follow the nerve roots to the cord. In this section, the arteria radicularis magna is seen as a neural branch on the right side. Other abbreviations: IA, intercostal arteries; IB, intercostal branches. <br/><span class="figcredit">With permission from Parke WW, Bono CM, Garfin SR 2011 Applied anatomy of the spine.

On each side, the main trunk of the artery (posterior intercostal or lumbar) passes around the vertebral body, giving off primary periosteal and equatorial branches to the body, and then a major dorsal branch. The latter gives off a spinal branch that enters the intervertebral foramen, before itself supplying the facet joints, the posterior surfaces of the laminae and the overlying muscles and skin. There is free anastomosis between these dorsal articular and soft tissue branches, extending over several segments (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_14">Crock and Yoshizawa 1976</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_8">Boelderl et al 2002</a>). At cervical and sacral levels, the longitudinally running arteries described above have direct spinal branches. The spinal branches are the main arteries of supply to all bony elements of the vertebrae and to the dura and epidural tissues, and also contribute to the supply of the spinal cord and nerve roots via radicular branches. As they enter the vertebral canal, the spinal arteries divide into postcentral, prelaminar and radicular branches. The postcentral branches, which are the main nutrient arteries to the vertebral bodies and to the periphery of the intervertebral discs, anastomose beneath the posterior longitudinal ligament with their fellows above and below, as well as across the midline (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0115"><span class="bold">Fig. 46.20B</span></a>). This anastomosis also supplies the anterior epidural tissues and dura. The majority of the vertebral arch, the posterior epidural tissues and dura, and the ligamentum flavum are supplied by the prelaminar branches and their anastomotic plexus on the posterior wall of the vertebral canal.

Upper posterior intercostal veins may drain into the caval system via brachiocephalic veins, whereas the lower intercostals drain into the azygos system. Lumbar veins are joined longitudinally in front of the transverse processes by the ascending lumbar veins, in which they may terminate.

The increase is linear in the neck but not in the thoracic and lumbar regions. There is some variation in size of the last two lumbar bodies, but thereafter width diminishes rapidly to the coccygeal apex. In the two lowest lumbar vertebrae, there is an inverse relation between the areas of the upper and lower surfaces of the bodies and the size of the pedicles and transverse processes.</div><div class="text" id="p0350">On each side, the vertebral arch has a vertically narrower ventral part – the pedicle – and a broader lamina dorsally. Paired transverse, superior and inferior articular processes project from their junctions. There is a median dorsal spinous process.</div><div class="text" id="p0355">Pedicles are short, thick, rounded dorsal projections from the superior part of the body at the junction of its lateral and dorsal surfaces; the concavity formed by the curved superior border of the pedicle is shallower than the inferior one (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0130">Fig. 46.23</a>). When vertebrae articulate by the intervertebral disc and facet joints, these adjacent vertebral notches contribute to an intervertebral foramen. The complete perimeter of an intervertebral foramen consists of the notches, the dorsolateral aspects of parts of adjacent vertebral bodies and the intervening disc, and the capsule of the synovial facet joint (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0155">Fig. 46.25</a>). The laminae are directly continuous with the pedicles. They are vertically flattened and curve dorsomedially.</div><div class="text" id="p0360">Lateral to the spinous processes, vertebral grooves contain the deep dorsal muscles. At cervical and lumbar levels, these grooves are shallow and mainly formed by laminae. In the thoracic region, they are deeper, broader and formed by the laminae and transverse processes. The laminae are broad for the first thoracic vertebra and narrow for the second to seventh, then broaden again from the eighth to eleventh, but become narrow thereafter down to the third lumbar vertebra.</div><div class="text" id="p0365">The spinous process (vertebral spine) projects dorsally and often caudally from the junction of the laminae. Spines vary considerably in size, shape and direction. They lie approximately in the median plane and project posteriorly, although in some individuals a minor deflection of the processes to one side may be seen. The spines act as levers for muscles that control posture and active movements (flexion/extension, lateral flexion and rotation) of the vertebral column.</div><div class="text" id="p0370">The paired superior and inferior articular processes (zygapophyses) arise from the vertebral arch at the pediculolaminar junctions. The superior processes project cranially, bearing dorsal facets that may also have a lateral or medial inclination, depending on level. Inferior processes run caudally with articular facets directed ventrally, again with a medial or lateral inclination that depends on vertebral level. Articular processes of adjoining vertebrae thus contribute to the synovial zygapophysial or facet joints, and form part of the posterior boundaries of the intervertebral foramina. These joints permit limited movement between vertebrae; mobility varies considerably with vertebral level.</div><div class="text" id="p0375">Transverse processes project laterally from the pediculolaminar junctions as levers for muscles and ligaments, particularly those concerned in rotation and lateral flexion. In the cervical region, the transverse processes are anterior to the articular processes, lateral to the pedicles and between the intervertebral foramina. In the thoracic region, they are posterior to the pedicles, considerably behind those of the cervical and lumbar processes. In the lumbar region, the transverse processes are anterior to the articular processes, but posterior to the intervertebral foramina. There is considerable regional variation in the structure and length of the transverse processes. In the cervical region, the transverse process of the atlas is long and broad, which allows the rotator muscles maximum mechanical advantage. Breadth varies little from the second to the sixth cervical vertebra, but increases in the seventh. In thoracic vertebrae, the first is widest, and breadth decreases to the twelfth, where the transverse elements are usually vestigial. The transverse processes become broader in the upper three lumbar vertebrae, and diminish in the fourth and fifth. The transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra is the most robust. It arises directly from the body and pedicle to allow for force transmission to the pelvis through the iliolumbar ligament.</div><div class="text" id="p0380">The thoracic transverse processes articulate with ribs, but at other levels the mature transverse process is a composite of a ‘true’ transverse process and an incorporated costal element. Costal elements develop as basic parts of neural arches in mammalian embryos, but become independent only as thoracic ribs. Elsewhere, they remain less developed and fuse with the ‘transverse process’ of descriptive anatomy (see <a href="../B9780702077050000185/B9780702077050000185.xhtml#f0060">Fig. 18.11C</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0385">Vertebrae are internally trabecular and have an external shell of compact bone perforated by vascular foramina (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0135">Fig. 46.23</a>).

These are a central zone, between the medial margins of the facet joints, and two lateral zones, beneath the facet joints and entering the intervertebral foramina. Each lateral zone, which passes into and just beyond the intervertebral foramen, can be further subdivided into subarticular (lateral recess), foraminal and extraforaminal regions (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">MacNab and McCulloch 1990</a>). The lateral zone thus described forms the canal of the spinal nerve (the radicular or ‘root’ canal). The central zone of the canal is a little narrower than the radiological interpedicular distance if the lateral recess is considered to be part of the radicular canal rather than part of the central zone.</div><section><a id="s0235"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0200">Spinal stenosis</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0410">Narrowing (stenosis) of the vertebral canal may occur at single or multiple spinal levels, and mainly affects the lumbar and cervical regions. Stenosis may affect the central canal and the ‘root canals’, either together or separately. There is a developmental form of the condition that mainly affects the central canal but more commonly the stenosis is degenerative, and results from intervertebral disc narrowing and osteoarthritic changes in the facet joints. This latter combination is more likely to narrow the intervertebral foramen and the ‘root canal’, even though the sectional profile of the vertebral canal in affected lumbar vertebrae typically changes from the shape of a bell to that of a trefoil. The lumbosacral intervertebral foramen, which is normally the smallest in the region, is particularly liable to such stenosis. Severe spinal stenosis may compress the spinal cord and compromise its arterial supply. More localized ‘root canal’ stenosis will present with the clinical features of spinal nerve compression, but without the tension signs that characterize the stretching of nerve roots over a prolapsed disc. Ischaemia of the nerves and roots may provoke more damage than the actual physical compression of the neural tissue.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0240"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0205">Intervertebral foramina</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0415">Intervertebral foramina are the principal routes of entry to and exit from the vertebral canal, and are closely related to the main intervertebral articulations. (Minor routes occur between the median, often partly fused, margins of the ligamenta flava.) The same general arrangement applies throughout the vertebral column, between the axis and sacrum, although there are some quantitative and structural regional variations. Because of their construction, contents and susceptibilities to multiple disorders, the intervertebral foramina are loci of great biomechanical, functional and clinical significance. The specializations cranial to the axis and at sacral levels are described with the individual bones and articulations.</div><div class="text" id="p0420">The boundaries of a generalized intervertebral foramen (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0145"><span class="bold">Fig. 46.25</span></a>) are, anteriorly, from above downwards, the posterolateral aspect of the superior vertebral body, the posterolateral aspect of the intervertebral symphysis (including the disc), and a small (variable) posterolateral part of the body of the inferior vertebra; superiorly, the compact bone of the deep arched inferior vertebral notch of the vertebra above; inferiorly, the compact bone of the shallow superior vertebral notch of the vertebra below; and posteriorly, a part of the ventral aspect of the fibrous capsule of the facet synovial joint. Cervical intervertebral foramina are distinct in having superior and inferior vertebral notches of almost equal depth, which, in accord with the direction of the pedicles, face anterolaterally. External to them, and oriented in the same direction, is a transverse process. The thoracic and lumbar intervertebral foramina face laterally and their transverse processes are posterior. In addition, the anteroinferior boundaries of the first to tenth thoracic foramina are formed by the articulations of the head of a rib and the capsules of double synovial joints (with the demifacets on adjacent vertebrae and the intra-articular ligament between the costocapitular ridge and the intervertebral symphysis). Lumbar foramina lie between the two principal lines of vertebral attachment of psoas major. The walls of each foramen are covered throughout by fibrous tissue, which is in turn periosteal (though the presence of a true periosteum lining the vertebral canal is controversial: <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib46" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_46">Newell (1999)</a>), perichondrial, anular and capsular. The more lateral parts of the foramina may be crossed at a variable level by narrow fibrous bands, the transforaminal ligaments (for detail of these ligaments, see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Bogduk (2012)</a>). The true foramen is the foraminal region of the canal of the spinal nerve (the radicular or ‘root’ canal). A foramen contains a segmental mixed spinal nerve and its sheaths, from two to four recurrent meningeal (sinuvertebral) nerves, variable numbers of spinal arteries, and plexiform venous connections between the internal and external vertebral venous plexuses. These structures, particularly the nerves, may be affected by trauma or one of the many disorders that may affect tissues bordering the foramen. In particular, nerve compression and irritation may be caused by intervertebral disc prolapse, or by bony entrapment as the size of the foramen decreases (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0155"><span class="bold">Fig. 46.26</span></a>).

The pedicles project posterolaterally and the longer laminae posteromedially, enclosing a large, roughly triangular vertebral foramen; the vertebral canal here accommodates the cervical enlargement of the spinal cord. The pedicles attach midway between the discal surfaces of the vertebral body, so the superior and inferior vertebral notches are of similar depth. The laminae are thin and slightly curved, with a thin superior and slightly thicker inferior border. The spinous process (‘spine’) is short and bifid, with two tubercles that are often unequal in size. The junction between lamina and pedicle bulges laterally between the superior and inferior articular processes to form an articular pillar (‘lateral mass’) on each side. The transverse process is morphologically composite around the foramen transversarium. Its dorsal and ventral bars terminate laterally as corresponding tubercles. The tubercles are connected, lateral to the foramen, by the costal (or intertubercular) lamella; these three elements represent morphologically the capitellum, tubercle and neck of a cervical costal element (see <a href="../B9780702077050000185/B9780702077050000185.xhtml#f0060">Fig. 18.11C</a>).

The discal margin gives attachment to the anterior longitudinal ligament. The posterior surface is flat or minimally concave, and its discal margins give attachment to the posterior longitudinal ligament. The central area displays several vascular foramina, of which two are commonly relatively larger. These are the basivertebral foramina, which transmit basivertebral veins to the anterior internal vertebral plexus. The superior discal surface is saddle-shaped, formed by flange-like lips, uncinate processes, which arise from most of the lateral circumference of the upper margin of the vertebral body. Uncinate processes are rudimentary at birth and are usually found on the third to seventh cervical vertebra in the adult. The uncinate processes on the vertebra below articulate with the corresponding bevelled surfaces on the inferior aspect of the vertebra above. Whether uncovertebral joints are synovial joints has proved controversial since their description by von Luschka in 1858; the demonstration of synoviocytes in the lateral joint capsule tissue of elderly uncovertebral joints suggests that they should be regarded as synovial joints (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_21">Hartman 2014</a>) (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0185">Fig. 46.59</a><a id="pg824.e1"/><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="825" id="pagebreak_825"/>). The inferior discal surface is also concave; the concavity is produced mainly by a broad projection from the anterior margin, which partly overlaps the anterior surface of the intervertebral disc. The discal surfaces of cervical vertebrae are so shaped in order to restrict both lateral and anteroposterior gliding movements during articulation. The paired ligamenta flava extend from the superior border of each lamina below to the roughened inferior half of the anterior surfaces of the lamina above. The superior part of the anterior surface of each lamina is smooth, like the immediately adjacent surfaces of the pedicles, which are usually in direct contact with the dura mater and cervical root sheaths to which they may become loosely attached. The spinous process of the sixth cervical vertebra is larger and is often not bifid.</div><div class="text" id="p0460">The superior articular facets, flat and ovoid, are directed superoposteriorly, whereas the corresponding inferior facets are directed mainly anteriorly, and lie nearer the coronal plane than the superior facets.

The dorsal rami of the cervical spinal nerves curve posteriorly, close to the anterolateral aspects of the lateral masses, and may actually lie in shallow grooves, especially on the third and fourth pairs. The dorsal root ganglion of each cervical spinal nerve lies between the superior and inferior vertebral notches of adjacent vertebrae. The large anterior ramus passes posterior to the vertebral artery, which lies on the concave upper surface of the costal lamella; the concavity of the lamellae increases from the fourth to the sixth vertebra. The fourth to sixth anterior tubercles are elongated and rough for muscle attachment.

The vertebral arch has two primary centres and the centrum one, as in a typical vertebra. The former appear from about postmenstrual week 10, and that for the centrum during postmenstrual weeks 13–20. The dens is largely ossified from bilateral centres, identified from postmenstrual week 16 and joining before birth to form a conical mass, deeply cleft above by cartilage. This cuneiform cartilage forms the apex of the odontoid process. A centre appears in it which shows considerable individual variation in both time of appearance and time of fusion to the rest of the dens; it most often appears between 5 and 8 years, but sometimes even later, fusing with the main mass in about the twelfth year. The cartilage was thought to be part of the cranial sclerotomal half of the first cervical segment or pro-atlas. It has also been suggested that the apical centre for the dens is itself derived from the pro-atlas, which may also contribute to lateral atlantal masses. The dens is separated from the body by a cartilaginous disc, the circumference of which ossifies while its centre remains cartilaginous until old age; possible rudiments of adjacent epiphyses of atlas and axis may occur in the disc. A thin epiphysial plate is formed inferior to the body around puberty.</div><div class="text" id="p0585">Ossification may sometimes be incomplete. Thus the apical cuneiform centre may fail to fuse with the dens, or the dens itself may fail to fuse with the body, instead forming an os odontoideum (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0220"><span class="bold">Fig. 46.38</span></a>). This is likely to result from minor trauma in early childhood causing disruption of the developing dens rather than being a congenital failure (<a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_bib.xhtml#bib27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Klimo et al 2007</a>).

Hypoplasia of the dens is usually accompanied by atlanto-occipital assimilation and basilar invagination. Abnormalities of the dens are common, and can result in atlanto-axial subluxation. In some skeletal dysplasias there is abnormal ossification in which the dens ossifies separately and much later than the atlantal centrum. This is probably a result of abnormal mobility in the cartilaginous anlage, and normal ossification may be restored if motion is prevented by surgical fusion.</div><div id="p0595"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0220"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000046X/main.assets/on46-18-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0400"/><a id="fspara0405"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 46.38</span> A sagittal CT scan reconstructed image demonstrating an os odontoideum (arrow).</figcaption></figure></div></div><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0225"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000046X/main.assets/on46-19-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0405"/><a id="fspara0410"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 46.39</span> A sagittal CT scan reconstructed image of a type II odontoid fracture (arrow).

Each costal element unites with its half vertebral arch between the second and fifth years, and the conjoined element so formed unites anteriorly with the centrum and posteriorly with its opposite fellow at about the eighth year. Thereafter, the upper and lower surfaces of each sacral body are covered by an epiphysial plate of hyaline cartilage, which is separated from its neighbour by the fibrocartilaginous precursor of an intervertebral disc. Laterally, successive conjoined vertebral arches and costal elements are separated by hyaline cartilage; a cartilaginous epiphysis, sometimes divided into upper and lower parts, develops on each auricular and adjacent lateral surface. Soon after puberty, the fused vertebral arches and costal elements of adjacent vertebrae begin to coalesce from below upwards.
