It is continuous cranially with the medulla oblongata, just below the level of the foramen magnum, at the upper border of the atlas. It terminates caudally as the conus medullaris. During development, the vertebral column elongates more rapidly than the spinal cord, so that there is an increasing discrepancy between the anatomical level of spinal cord segments and their corresponding vertebrae. At stage 23, the vertebral column and spinal cord are the same length and the cord ends at the last coccygeal vertebra. In later fetal life, the conus medullaris lies between the third lumbar and fifth sacral vertebrae. In premature and term neonates, it lies between the first and third lumbar vertebrae, and in children between the ages of 1 and 7 years, it lies between the twelfth thoracic and third lumbar vertebrae (<a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_3">Barson 1970</a>, <a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">Vettivel 1991</a>, <a href="#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">Malas et al 2001</a>, <a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Kesler et al 2007</a>, <a href="#bib37" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_37">Suresh et al 2013</a>).

It is not cylindrical, being wider transversely at all levels, especially in the cervical segments. The cervical enlargement, the source of the large spinal nerves that supply the upper limbs, extends from the third cervical to the second thoracic segments. Its maximum circumference (approximately 38<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm) is in the sixth cervical segment (a spinal cord segment provides the attachment of the rootlets of a pair of spinal nerves). The lumbar enlargement, the source of the large spinal nerves that supply the lower limbs, extends from the first lumbar to the third sacral segments; the equivalent vertebral levels are the ninth to twelfth thoracic vertebrae. Its greatest circumference (approximately 35<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm) is near the lower part of the body of the twelfth thoracic vertebra, below which it rapidly dwindles into the conus medullaris.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">Fissures and sulci extend along most of the external surface. A ventral (anterior) median fissure (sulcus) and a posterior median sulcus and septum almost completely separate the cord into right and left halves; they are joined by a commissural band of nervous tissue that contains a central canal (see <a href="../B9780702077050000276/B9780702077050000276.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 27.1</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0050">The ventral median fissure extends along the whole ventral surface with an average depth of 3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm, although it is deeper at caudal levels. It contains a reticulum of pia mater. Dorsal to it is the anterior white commissure. Perforating branches of the spinal vessels pass from the fissure to the commissure to supply the central spinal region. The posterior median sulcus is shallower, and from it a posterior median septum penetrates more than halfway into the cord, almost to the central canal. The septum varies in anteroposterior extent from 4 to 6<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm, and diminishes caudally as the canal becomes more dorsally placed and the cord contracts. The patency of the central canal diminishes with age: a postmortem study found the canal to be patent along the length of the cord in infants under 1 year of age, but occluded in most segments with increasing age after the second decade (<a href="#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_41">Yasui et al 1999</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0055">Dorsal rootlets of spinal nerves enter the cord along a posterolateral sulcus that lies from 1.5 to 2.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm lateral to each side of the posterior median sulcus. The white matter between the posteromedian and posterolateral sulci on each side is the dorsal (posterior) funiculus. In cervical and upper thoracic segments, a longitudinal posterointermediate sulcus marks a septum dividing each posterior funiculus into two large tracts on either side, a medial fasciculus gracilis and a lateral fasciculus cuneatus. A ventrolateral (anterolateral) funiculus lies between the posterolateral sulcus and ventral median fissure, and is subdivided into ventral (anterior) and lateral funiculi by ventral spinal rootlets that pass through its substance to issue from the surface of the cord. The ventral funiculus is medial to, and includes, the emerging ventral rootlets, whilst the lateral funiculus lies between the roots and the posterolateral sulcus. In upper cervical segments, nerve rootlets emerge through each lateral funiculus to form the accessory nerve, which ascends in the vertebral canal lateral to the spinal cord and enters the posterior cranial fossa via the foramen magnum (see <a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355.xhtml#f0060">Fig. 35.11</a>).</div><section><a id="s0015"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0025">Dorsal and ventral roots</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0060">The paired dorsal and ventral roots of the spinal nerves are continuous with the spinal cord (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 47.1F</span></a>). They cross the subarachnoid space and traverse the dura mater separately, uniting in or close to their intervertebral foramina to form the (mixed) spinal nerves. Since the spinal cord is shorter than the vertebral column, the more caudal spinal roots descend for varying distances around and beyond the cord to reach their corresponding foramina. In so doing, they form a divergent sheaf of spinal nerve roots, the cauda equina, which is gathered round the filum terminale in the spinal theca, mostly distal to the apex of the cord.</div><div class="text" id="p0065">Ventral spinal roots contain efferent somatic and, at some levels, preganglionic sympathetic, axons that extend from neuronal cell bodies in the ventral horns and intermediolateral columns, respectively. There are also afferent nerve fibres in these roots. The rootlets comprising each ventral root emerge from the anterolateral sulcus in groups over an <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="857" id="pagebreak_857"/><a id="pg856.e1"/>elongated vertical elliptical area (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 47.1F</a>). Dorsal spinal roots bear ovoid swellings, the spinal ganglia, one on each root proximal to its junction with a corresponding ventral root in an intervertebral foramen. Each root fans out into 6–8 rootlets before entering the cord in a vertical row in the posterolateral sulcus. Dorsal roots are usually said to contain only afferent axons (both somatic and visceral), which are the central processes of unipolar neurones in the spinal root ganglia, but they may also contain a small number (3%) of efferent fibres and autonomic vasodilator fibres.</div><div class="text" id="p0070">Each ganglionic neurone has a single short stem that divides into a medial (central) branch that enters the spinal cord via a dorsal root, and a lateral (peripheral) branch that passes peripherally to a sensory end organ. The central branch is an axon while the peripheral one is an elongated dendrite (but when traversing a peripheral nerve is, in general structural terms, indistinguishable from an axon). The region of spinal cord associated with the emergence of a pair of nerves is a spinal segment but there is no actual surface indication of segmentation. Moreover, the deep neural sources or destinations of radicular fibres may lie far beyond the confines of the ‘segment’ so defined.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0020"/><hgroup><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0030">Meninges</h2><h3 class="h2after1" id="cesectitle0035">Dura mater</h3></hgroup><section><a id="s0025"/><div class="textfl" id="p0075">In some areas within the skull, the dura mater can be distinguished from the endosteum, but at the base of the skull around the foramen magnum the two layers are fused and adherent to the bone. Distal to the foramen magnum, within the vertebral column, the dura is distinct from the tissues that line the vertebral canal, and separated from them by the epidural space (see below). The spinal dura mater forms a tube whose upper end is attached to the edge of the foramen magnum and to the posterior surfaces of the second and third cervical vertebral bodies, and also by fibrous bands to the posterior longitudinal ligament, especially towards the caudal end of the vertebral canal. The dural tube narrows at the lower border of the second sacral vertebra. It invests the thin spinal filum terminale, descends to the back of the coccyx, and blends with the periosteum.</div><section><a id="s0030"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0040">Epidural space</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0080">The epidural space lies between the spinal dura mater and the tissues that line the vertebral canal (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 47.2</a>). It is closed above by fusion of the spinal dura with the edge of the foramen magnum, and below by the posterior sacrococcygeal ligament that closes the sacral hiatus. It contains loosely packed connective tissue, fat, a venous plexus, small arterial branches, lymphatics and fine fibrous bands that connect the theca with the lining tissue of the vertebral canal. These bands, the meningovertebral ligaments, are best developed anteriorly and laterally. Similar bands tether the nerve root sheaths or ‘sleeves’ within their canals. There is also a midline attachment from the posterior spinal dura to the ligamentum nuchae at atlanto-occipital and atlanto-axial levels (<a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_13">Dean and Mitchell 2002</a>). The venous plexus consists of longitudinally arranged chains of vessels, connected by circumdural venous ‘rings’. The anteriorly placed vessels receive the basivertebral veins.</div><div class="text" id="p0090">The shape of the space within each spinal segment is not uniform, though the segmental pattern is metamerically repeated. It is difficult to define the true shape of the ‘space’ because it changes with the introduction of fluid or as a result of preservation techniques. In the lumbar region, the dura mater is apposed to the walls of the vertebral canal anteriorly and attached by connective tissue in a manner that permits displacement of the dural sac during movement and venous engorgement. Adipose tissue is present posteriorly in recesses between the ligamentum flavum and the dura. The connective tissue extends for a short distance through the intervertebral foramina along the sheaths of the spinal nerves. Like the main thecal sac, the root sheaths are partially tethered to the walls of the foramina by fine meningovertebral ligaments.</div><div class="text" id="p0095">A variety of pathological processes can occur within the epidural space, compressing the dura and resulting in pain and potential neurological disturbance.

It is closely applied to the deep aspect of the dura mater. At sites where vessels and nerves enter or leave the subarachnoid space, the arachnoid mater is reflected on to the surface of these structures and forms a thin coating of leptomeningeal cells over the surface of both vessels and nerves. Thus a subarachnoid angle is formed as nerves pass through the dura into the intervertebral foramina. At this point, the layers of leptomeninges (arachnoid and pia) fuse and become continuous with the perineurium. The epineurium is in continuity with the dura. Such an arrangement seals the subarachnoid space so that particulate matter does not pass directly from the subarachnoid space into nerves.

The first crosses behind the vertebral artery where it is attached to the dura mater, and is separated by the artery from the first cervical ventral root.

This layer is concentrated in the dorsal and ventral regions, and forms a highly perforated, almost lace-like structure that is focally compacted to form the dorsal, dorsolateral and ventral ligaments of the spinal cord. Dorsally, the intermediate layer is adherent to the deep aspect of the arachnoid mater and forms a discontinuous series of dorsal ligaments that attach the spinal cord to the arachnoid. The dorsolateral ligaments are more delicate and fenestrated, and they extend from the dorsal roots to the parietal arachnoid. As the intermediate layer spreads laterally over the dorsal surface of the dorsal roots, it becomes increasingly perforated and eventually disappears. A similar arrangement is seen over the ventral aspect of the spinal cord but the intermediate layer is less substantial.</div><div class="text" id="p0135">The intermediate layer is structurally similar to the trabeculae that cross the cranial subarachnoid space, i.e. it has a collagenous core coated by leptomeningeal cells. The intermediate layers of leptomeninges around the spinal cord may act as a baffle within the subarachnoid space to dampen waves of CSF movement in the vertebral canal. Inflammation within the spinal subarachnoid space may result in extensive fibrosis within the intermediate layer and the complications of chronic arachnoiditis (<a href="#f0045"><span class="bold">Fig. 47.6</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0045"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000471/main.assets/f47-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0020"/><a id="fspara0020"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 47.6</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, A lumbar spinal nerve and its roots and meningeal coverings. <span class="bold">B</span>–<span class="bold">D</span>, Extradural anomalies of the lumbar nerve roots.</figcaption></figure></div></section><section><a id="s0060"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0070">Coverings and relations of the spinal roots and nerves in the radicular canal</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0140">Tubular prolongations of spinal dura mater, closely lined by arachnoid, extend around the spinal roots and nerves as they pass through the lateral zone of the vertebral canal and through the intervertebral foramina (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 47.5</a>; <a href="#f0045"><span class="bold">Fig. 47.6A</span></a>). These prolongations, the spinal nerve sheaths or root sheaths, gradually lengthen as the spinal roots become increasingly oblique. Each individual dorsal and ventral root runs in the subarachnoid space with its own covering of pia mater. Each root pierces the dura separately, taking a sleeve of arachnoid with it, before joining within the dural prolongation just distal to the spinal ganglion. The dural sheaths of the spinal nerves fuse with the epineurium, within or slightly beyond the intervertebral foramina. The arachnoid prolongations within the sheaths do not extend as far distally as their dural coverings, but the subarachnoid space and the CSF it contains extend sufficiently distally to form a radiologically demonstrable root sleeve for each nerve. Shortening or obstruction of this sleeve seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicates compression of the spinal nerve. At the cervical level, where the nerves are short and the vertebral movement is greatest, the dural sheaths are tethered to the periosteum of the adjacent transverse processes. In the lumbosacral region, there is less tethering of the dura to the periosteum, though there may be an attachment posteriorly to the facet joint capsule.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0065"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0075">Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0145">The cerebrospinal fluid is described in detail in <a href="../B9780702077050000252/B9780702077050000252.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>.

The term spinal nerve strictly applies only to the short segment after union of the roots and before branching occurs. This segment, the spinal nerve proper, lies in the intervertebral foramen; it is sometimes mistakenly called the ‘nerve root’. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves: 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and 1 coccygeal. The abbreviations C, T, L, S and Co, with appropriate numerals, are commonly applied to individual nerves as individual ‘root values’. The peripheral nerves emerge through the intervertebral foramina. At thoracic, lumbar, sacral and coccygeal levels, the numbered nerve exits the vertebral canal by passing below the pedicle of the corresponding vertebra, e.g. L4 nerve exits the intervertebral foramen between L4 and L5. However, in the cervical region, nerves C1–C7 pass above their corresponding vertebrae. C1 leaves the vertebral canal between the occipital bone and atlas, and hence is often termed the suboccipital nerve. The last pair of cervical nerves does not have a correspondingly numbered vertebra and C8 passes between the seventh cervical and first thoracic vertebrae. Each nerve is continuous with the spinal cord by ventral and dorsal roots; each dorsal root bears a spinal, sensory ganglion (dorsal root ganglion).<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="861" id="pagebreak_861"/><a id="pg861"/></div><section><a id="s0075"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0085">Spinal roots and ganglia</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0090">Ventral (anterior) roots</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0080"/><div class="textfl" id="p0160">Ventral roots contain axons of neurones in the ventral (anterior) and lateral spinal grey columns.

Ganglia are usually sited in the intervertebral foramina, immediately lateral to the perforation of the dura mater by the roots (see <a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 47.1B</span></a>). However, the first cervical ganglion lies on the vertebral arch of the atlas, the second lies behind the lateral atlanto-axial joint, the sacral lie inside the vertebral canal, and the coccygeal ganglion usually lies within the dura mater.

These very soon divide into dorsal and ventral rami, both of which receive fibres from both roots (see <a href="#f0045">Fig. 47.6A</a>). At all levels above the sacral, this division occurs within the intervertebral foramen. Division of the sacral spinal nerves occurs within the sacral vertebral canal, and the dorsal and ventral rami exit separately through posterior and anterior sacral foramina at each level. Spinal nerves trifurcate at some cervical and thoracic levels, in which case the third branch is called a ramus intermedius. At or distal to its origin, each ventral ramus gives off recurrent meningeal (sinuvertebral) branches and receives a grey ramus communicans from the corresponding sympathetic ganglion. The thoracic and first and second lumbar ventral rami each contribute a white ramus communicans to the corresponding sympathetic ganglia. The second, third and fourth sacral nerves also supply visceral branches, unconnected with sympathetic ganglia, which carry a parasympathetic outflow direct to the pelvic plexuses.</div><div class="text" id="p0200">Cervical spinal nerves enlarge from the first to the sixth nerve.

The coccygeal nerves are the smallest spinal nerves. The size of the spinal nerve and its associated structures within the intervertebral foramen is not in direct relation to the size of the foramen.

They are mixed sensory and sympathetic nerves, represented by numerous fine filaments amongst which one, or two to four, larger trunks may be evident. At cervical levels, the autonomic roots arise from the grey rami that form the vertebral nerve. At thoracic and lumbar levels, each nerve is formed by a somatic root from the ventral ramus and by an autonomic root from the grey ramus communicans of that segment. Each nerve pursues a recurrent course through the intervertebral foramen, passing ventral to the spinal nerve, to enter the vertebral canal, where it divides into ascending, descending and transverse branches. These branches communicate with corresponding branches from the segments above and below, and from the opposite side, forming arcades along the floor of the vertebral canal. Meningeal branches of the arcades form a plexus on the ventral surface of the dural sac and nerve root sleeves that attenuates laterally; the posterior paramedian dura is devoid of nerve endings.

Each nerve continues this oblique course to supply multifidus and semispinalis. At the fifth to eighth thoracic levels, the medial branches assume a course parallel to that of other levels, but do not reach the transverse process, instead passing superior and dorsal to the plane of the transverse processes. At the eleventh and twelfth levels, in keeping with the relatively short transverse processes at these levels, the medial branches run close to the superior articular processes. Each medial branch supplies articular branches to the facet joints above and below its course. Medial branches of the upper six thoracic dorsal rami furnish cutaneous branches that pierce trapezius and the rhomboids to reach the skin near the spinous processes.

Each dorsal ramus supplies the overlying medial intertransverse muscle before dividing into lateral and medial branches. The lateral branches supply the longissimus and iliocostalis components of the lumbar erector spinae. The upper three lumbar lateral branches emerge from the lateral border of iliocostalis lumborum and pierce the aponeurosis of latissimus dorsi to become cutaneous. They cross the iliac crest to reach the gluteal skin; some reach as far as the level of the greater trochanter. Medial branches cross the junction of the superior articular process and transverse process, and hook medially between the mammillary and accessory processes, deep to the mammillo-accessory ligament. Medial to the ligament, each medial branch sends articular branches to the facet joints above and below its course, before entering multifidus, which it supplies.

For many years, it was assumed that the anterior spinal artery system provided the dominant supply to the cord, but clinical evidence implies that the posterior spinal arteries may be as important as the anterior system in protecting the cord.

In estimating the vertebral levels of cord segments in the adult, a useful approximation is that, in the cervical region, the tip of a vertebral spinous process corresponds to the succeeding cord segment (i.e. the sixth cervical spine is opposite the seventh spinal segment); at upper thoracic levels, the tip of a vertebral spine corresponds to the cord two segments lower (i.e. the fourth spine is level with the sixth segment), <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="866" id="pagebreak_866"/><a id="pg865.e1"/>and in the lower thoracic region, there is a difference of three segments (i.e. the tenth thoracic spine is level with the first lumbar segment).

In making this estimate by palpation of the vertebral spines, it is important to remember the relationship of the individual spines to their vertebral bodies.

Lesions between C5 and T1 paralyse all four limbs (quadriplegia), the effects in the upper limbs varying with the site of injury: at the fifth cervical segment, paralysis is complete; and at the sixth, each arm is positioned in abduction and lateral rotation, with the elbow flexed and the forearm supinated, due to unopposed activity in deltoid, supraspinatus, rhomboid and the brachial flexors (all supplied by the fifth cervical spinal nerves). Upper limb paralysis is less marked in lower cervical lesions. Lesions of the first thoracic segment paralyse small muscles in the hand and damage the sympathetic outflow to the head and neck, resulting in contraction of the pupil, recession of the eyeball, narrowing of the palpebral fissure and loss of sweating in the face and neck (Horner’s syndrome). However, sensation is retained in areas innervated by segments above the lesion; thus cutaneous sensation is retained in the neck and chest down to the second intercostal space because this area is innervated by the supraclavicular nerves (C3 and C4). At thoracic levels, division of the cord paralyses the trunk below the segmental level of the lesion, and both lower limbs (paraplegia). The first sacral neural segment is approximately level with the thoracolumbar vertebral junction; injury, which commonly occurs here, paralyses the urinary bladder, the rectum and muscles supplied by the sacral segments, and cutaneous sensibility is lost in the perineum, buttocks, the back of the thighs and the legs, and soles of the feet. The roots of lumbar nerves descending to join the cauda equina may be damaged at this level, causing complete paralysis of both lower limbs. Lesions below the first lumbar vertebra may divide or damage the cauda equina, but severe nerve damage is uncommon and is usually confined to the spinal roots at the level of the trauma.

The most common of these is central cord syndrome, which usually results from hyperextension injury to an osteoarthritic neck, when the major injury is to the central grey matter. This typically gives an incomplete cord injury pattern with greater motor loss in the upper extremities than in the lower limbs. There is also variable sensory loss and neurogenic bladder dysfunction (<a href="#bib33" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_33">Pouw et al 2010</a>). In anterior cord syndrome, which may occur in flexion–compression injuries of the neck, the damage occurs in the area of supply of the anterior spinal artery, sparing the posterior columns; the motor loss is usually proportionately greater in the lower than in the upper limbs, while sensory loss is less of a problem. A third syndrome that may be seen with penetrating trauma is Brown–Séquard syndrome. This is an injury directed to one side of the spinal cord, where there is ipsilateral loss of motor function and pinprick sensation and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation (<a href="#bib27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_27">Lee et al 1990</a>). The anatomical basis for these symptoms is injury to the ipsilateral posterior columns and corticospinal tract, and injury to the lateral spinothalamic tract, which conveys contralateral pain and temperature sensation (see <a href="../B9780702077050000276/B9780702077050000276.xhtml">Ch. 27</a>).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0245"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0255">Lesions of the spinal roots, nerves and ganglia</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0410">Spinal roots, nerves and ganglia may be damaged in the vertebral and root canals and at the intervertebral foramina.

Patients may find it hard to define the outer boundaries of this pain but they can clearly identify the centre of its distribution. Referred pain can be subdivided into somatic referred pain and visceral referred pain, according to its origin. As its name implies, visceral referred pain is caused by disorders in viscera; in some cases, the referral can be quite remote from the viscus, e.g. cardiac pain that radiates into the neck. Somatic referred pain is caused by disorders of muscular and skeletal structures. Examples include lumbar spinal pain referred to the gluteal region, thigh or leg; cervical spinal pain referred to the upper limb girdle; and cervical or thoracic spinal pain referred to the chest wall, where it may mimic cardiac pain.

Cauda equina syndrome typically presents in men who have a lumbar disc herniation in the setting of lumbar spinal stenosis, with symptoms of asymmetric saddle anaesthesia and asymmetric lower extremity weakness, and delayed presentation of atonic bladder and flaccid anal sphincter. Conus medullaris syndrome typically presents with symmetric saddle anaesthesia, symmetric motor deficit and earlier atonic bladder and sphincter dysfunction. The usual causes are intradural tumours or vascular lesions (<a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Radcliff et al 2011</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0450">Tethered cord syndrome may be associated with occult or non-occult spinal dysraphism. In its classic form, it refers to an unusually low conus medullaris (although in some 14–18% of cases the position of the conus is anatomically normal). There is some debate as to what constitutes an abnormally low conus, whether below the L1–2 disc space or below the lower border of the body of the L2 vertebra. Most commonly, tethered cord syndrome is associated with a short filum terminale more than 2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm wide, but it also may be related to an intradural lipoma. Traction on the caudal cord and loss of filum terminale elasticity are thought to predispose to decreased blood flow in the cord, leading to symptoms (<a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Filippidis et al 2010</a>). The clinical presentation varies according to age. In children, the most common presentation includes foot deformities, neurological deficits, spinal deformity and various cutaneous findings such as a lumbar capillary angioma. In adults, the syndrome more commonly presents with perianal pain and leg weakness (see <a href="#f0060">Fig. 47.18</a>) (<a href="#bib32" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_32">Pang and Wilberger 1982</a>).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0260"/><hgroup><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0270">Clinical Procedures</h2><h3 class="h2after1" id="cesectitle0275">Access to cerebrospinal fluid</h3></hgroup><section><a id="s0265"/><div class="textfl" id="p0460">The safest approach to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is to enter the lumbar cistern of the subarachnoid space in the midline, well below the level at which the spinal cord normally terminates (see above). The fine needle employed is unlikely to damage the mobile nerve roots of the cauda equina. This procedure is called lumbar puncture. It is also possible to access the CSF by midline puncture of the cerebellomedullary cistern (cisterna magna) (<a href="../B9780702077050000252/B9780702077050000252.xhtml">Ch. 25</a>): this is cisternal puncture.</div><section><a id="s0270"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0280">Lumbar puncture: adult</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0465">Lumbar puncture in the adult may be performed with the patient either sitting or lying on their side (lateral decubitus) on a firm, flat surface. In each position, the lumbar spine must be flexed as far as possible, in order to separate the vertebral spines maximally and expose the ligamentum flavum in the interlaminar window (<a href="#f0105"><span class="bold">Fig. 47.19</span></a>). A line is then taken between the highest points of the iliac crests: this line almost always intersects the vertebral column at the vertebral body of L4 or the L4/L5 intervertebral disc level, but it may range from the L2/L3 interspinous space to the spinous process of L5 (see <a href="../B9780702077050000768/B9780702077050000768.xhtml#f0085">Fig. 76.19</a>). In most adults the plane intersects the vertebral column inferior to the termination of the spinal cord (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X_split_a.xhtml#f0455">Fig. 46.81C</a>). Localizing the supracristal plane via palpation may place it at a higher level in females and individuals with a higher body mass index (<a href="#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Kim et al 2007</a>, <a href="#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_21">Hale et al 2010</a>). With the spines now identified, the skin is anaesthetized and a needle is inserted between the spines of L3 and L4 (or L4 and L5). Exact identification of the level by palpation is difficult (<a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_10">Broadbent et al 2000</a>). The soft tissues that the needle will traverse should also be anaesthetized; care should be taken that the injection of an excessive amount of local anaesthetic does not compromise appreciation of the structures being traversed. These will be, in order: subcutaneous tissue, supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum, epidural space containing the internal vertebral venous plexus, dura, arachnoid, and finally, the subarachnoid space (<a href="#f0115"><span class="bold">Fig. 47.20</span></a>). The lumbar puncture needle may then be inserted in the midline or just to one side, and angled in the horizontal and sagittal planes sufficiently to pierce the ligamentum flavum in or very near the midline. There is then a slight loss of resistance as the needle enters the epidural space; careful advancement will next pierce the dura and arachnoid to release CSF.

In infants (postnatal month 2 to 3 years) and children (3–7 years), the conus medullaris lies most commonly at the lower third of the vertebral body of L1 (range, lower third of the vertebral body of T12 to the L2/L3 intervertebral disc) (<a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Barson 1970</a>, <a href="#bib4" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Barson and Sands 1977</a>, <a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Vettivel 1991</a>, <a href="#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Malas et al 2001</a>, <a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Kesler et al 2007</a>, <a href="#bib37" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Suresh et al 2013</a>). The supracristal plane most commonly intersects the vertebral column at a slightly higher level in children (L3–L4) than in adults (L4–L4/L5); when located via palpation it may range in position from the L2/L3 to the L5/S1 interspinous space. These differences and the potential overlap between the level of the supracristal plane and the termination of the spinal cord must be borne in mind before undertaking lumbar puncture in the neonate and infant. Ultrasound guidance may be preferable (<a href="#bib5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_5">Baxter et al 2016</a>). A lumbar puncture is performed by placing the infant in a position, either lying or sitting, that gives maximum convex curvature to the lumbar spine. A trocar needle is inserted into the back between the spinous processes of either L3 and L4 or L4 and L5 lumbar vertebrae and into the subarachnoid space below the level of the conus medullaris. The space between L3 and L4 is approximately level with the iliac crests and it is usual to insert the trocar needle into the intervertebral space immediately above or below the iliac crests.

Techniques for entering the epidural space rely on the appreciation of loss of resistance to injection of saline (air is used by some) as the space is entered: saline cannot be injected into the dense ligamentum flavum, but can be injected into the loose tissues of the epidural space. As there is very little distance between the ligamentum flavum and the underlying dura, care must be taken not to continue advancing the needle once loss of resistance has occurred.</div></section><section><a id="s0300"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0310">Caudal epidural</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0500">The route of access to the caudal epidural space is via the sacral hiatus. This means that the space is entered below the level of termination of the dural sac (the subarachnoid space and its contained CSF), which usually extends only to the level of the second sacral segment. Occasionally, the dural sac ends as high as the fifth lumbar vertebra, and very rarely it may extend to the third part of the sacrum, in which case it is occasionally possible to enter the subarachnoid space inadvertently during the course of a sacral nerve block.</div><div class="text" id="p0505">With the patient in the lateral position or lying prone over a pelvic pillow, the sacral hiatus is identified by palpation of the sacral cornua (<a href="#f0120"><span class="bold">Fig. 47.21</span></a>).

Alternatively, the sacral hiatus may be approximated by constructing an equilateral triangle based on a line joining the posterior superior iliac spines where the the inferior apex of the triangle overlies the hiatus (see <a href="../B9780702077050000768/B9780702077050000768.xhtml#f0085">Fig. 76.19</a>). After local anaesthetic infiltration, a needle is introduced at 45° to the skin, in order to penetrate the posterior sacrococcygeal ligament and enter the sacral canal. The puncture of the ligament can usually be felt as the needle is advanced. Once the canal is entered, the hub of the needle is lowered so that the needle may be fed along the canal (<a href="#f0125"><span class="bold">Fig. 47.22</span></a>).

Each medial branch innervates not only the adjacent facet joint capsule but also the capsule of the facet joint located at the level immediately below it, which means that each facet joint has a dual innervation (<a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_1">Amrhein et al 2016</a>).
