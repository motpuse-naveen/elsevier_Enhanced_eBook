Prior to the migration of neural crest cells from the edges of the cranial neural folds to their final destinations, the only mesenchyme in the embryonic head is ‘primary mesenchyme’, i.e. mesenchymal cells formed by epithelial–mesenchymal transformation in the primitive streak. This is the mesodermal germ layer. There is no lateral plate mesoderm in the head; all of the cranial mesoderm is paraxial. Thus cranial mesenchyme is derived from mesodermal, neural crest and placodal sources, each of which has specific distributions and specific derivatives.</div><div class="text" id="p0020">Evolution of the vertebrate head is a consequence of the origin of a novel cell population, the neural crest.

This early division is of major functional and organizational significance because it separates the regions of origin of the skeletogenic neural crest populations that make a major contribution to the skull from those that form skeletal structures in the neck (hyoid bone and larynx). During cranial neurulation, the prorhombomeres undergo subdivision so that, by the time the brain region of the neural tube closes, seven rhombomeres can be clearly distinguished. The occipital region (adjacent to the four occipital somites) remains unsegmented (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 17.2B</span></a>) and by analogy with the segmented rhombencephalon, it is also referred to as prorhombomere D/rhombomere 8. The segmental organization of the embryonic head caudal to prorhombomere A is related to the expression of evolutionarily conserved <span class="italic">HOX</span> genes (written <span class="italic">Hox</span> in the mouse) that have their rostral boundaries at specific rhombomere divisions; they are also expressed in the corresponding neural crest cells (<a href="#bib75" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_75">Santagati and Rijli 2003</a>, <a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">Hutchins et al 2018</a>).

These studies show three separate populations of neural crest cells migrating from the cranial neural folds; each gives rise to both neuronal and non-neuronal progeny (<a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_44">Jiang et al 2002</a>). The first (trigeminal) population originates from the diencephalic region of the forebrain, the midbrain and prorhombomere A of the hindbrain (which subsequently divides to form rhombomeres 1 and 2) (see <a href="#f0015">Figs 17.2A–B</a>). The neural crest cells with a neuronal fate contribute to the trigeminal ganglion. The non-neuronal cells migrate extensively to surround the telencephalon and part of the diencephalon, forming the frontonasal mesenchymal populations and also migrate lateral to the rhombencephalon to form the mesenchyme of the maxillary and mandibular regions of the first arch (see <a href="#f0015">Figs 17.2C–D</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0035">The second (hyoid) population emigrates from prorhombomere B (which forms rhombomeres 3 and 4); some cells condense to form the otic ganglion before the main population continues into the second pharyngeal arch. The third (vagal) population has a more extensive origin, from the neural folds caudal to the otocyst, i.e. prorhombomere C. These cells will contribute to the ganglia of the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves. The non-neuronal vagal crest cells migrate into pharyngeal arches 3, 4 and 6 and some of them continue into the heart where they contribute to the division of the cardiac outflow tract (<a href="#bib46" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_46">Jiang et al 2000</a>). The neural crest also gives rise to the parasympathetic ganglia and parasympathetic postganglionic nerves in the head and neck.

They eventually differentiate to form the connective tissue of the tongue and the occipital myoblasts form the intrinsic tongue musculature. No sensory ganglia are formed from the occipital neural crest in human embryos.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">Ectodermal placodes appear as patches of columnar or pseudostratified epithelium within the otherwise squamous epithelium of the surface ectoderm. Three pairs of placodes contribute to sense organs, forming the olfactory epithelium, the lens and the otocyst. They each undergo morphogenesis to form a pit and then (for the lens and otic pits) a closed cyst (vesicle). Epibranchial (epipharyngeal) placodes are situated near the proximal end of each pharyngeal arch. Some of their cells undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transformation, joining the underlying neural crest cell condensations to form sensory neuroblasts in the ganglia of cranial nerves V, VII, IX and X. Some cells from the otocyst and an adjacent placode similarly delaminate to contribute to the ganglia of cranial nerve VIII.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Embryonic Pharynx and Pharyngeal Arches</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0050">The most cranial portion of the foregut, the embryonic pharynx, is the scaffolding around which the face, palate and anterior neck structures are built. The development of this region from neural crest, paraxial mesoderm, surface ectoderm and foregut endoderm involves spatiotemporal coordination of cell movement, tissue growth and tissue interactions. As successive populations of neural crest cells migrate around the pharynx at progressively more caudal levels, five pairs of pharyngeal arches are formed (numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 for consistency with comparative anatomy terminology, although this numbering has been queried because it does not seem to reflect the situation across the vertebrates as a whole (<a href="#bib33" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_33">Graham et al 2019</a>)). This process is complete by stages 14–15 (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 17.3</span></a>). For details of the age in postfertilization days of the stages given see <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 23.3</a>. Pharyngeal clefts (grooves) separate the arches externally and are matched internally by internal depressions, the pharyngeal pouches (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 17.3</a>).

Understanding the origin and fates of the structures within the pharyngeal arches is aided by considering their conformity to, or deviation from, a basic plan: the cartilages, muscles, nerves and arteries associated with each arch are summarized in <a href="#t0010"><span class="bold">Table 17.1</span></a>. The neural crest cells of arches 1–4 form a skeletal element and associated connective tissue: in all arches they give rise to the outer walls of an aortic arch blood vessel with an endothelial lining that develops by angiogenesis from the heart outflow tract endocardium. Paraxial mesoderm also forms the muscle associated with each pharyngeal arch. Motor and sensory innervation is supplied by arch-specific cranial nerves. For an overview of the organization of these tissues in the pharynx, see <a href="../B9780702077050000124/B9780702077050000124.xhtml#f0025">Fig. 12.4</a>; for their fate, see <a href="#f0030">Figs 17.5</a>–<a href="#f0040">17.7</a>.</div><div class="text" id="p0060">The first pharyngeal arch, unlike the other arches, possesses a dorsal and ventral process, and appears C-shaped in lateral view.

The maxillary division <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="278" id="pagebreak_278"/><a id="pg278"/>of the trigeminal nerve has no motor component, because no muscles are derived from maxillary mesenchyme.</div><div class="text" id="p0095">The muscles of the second arch migrate widely but retain their original nerve supply from the facial nerve.

Stylopharyngeus is a third arch muscle, and is innervated by a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve. All of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles are innervated by the vagus nerve: the cricothyroid by the superior laryngeal branch to the fourth arch and the others by the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which has been considered to be the sixth arch nerve. Precise arch origins are not clearly defined for the palatal muscles (except tensor veli palatini), or for the pharyngeal constrictors; these muscles all receive their nerve supply via the pharyngeal plexus (see <a href="../B9780702077050000409/B9780702077050000409.xhtml">Ch. 40</a>).

They are the trigeminal (V), facial (VII), glossopharyngeal (IX), vagus (X) and cranial and spinal accessory (XI) nerves. The motor nerves extend from the basal plate of the hindbrain to innervate the striated muscle of the arches and are termed special visceral efferent nerves because they innervate pharyngeal musculature. Sensory nerves extend peripherally and centrally from cranial ganglia that are formed partly from neural crest and partly from cells that delaminate from epibranchial placodes; they convey general and special somatic afferent axons. Each arch is innervated by a mixed nerve, but the nerves of the first three arches also have a purely sensory branch that innervates the arch rostral to its ‘own’ arch; this sensory nerve is called the pretrematic branch because it extends rostral to the cleft (trema) between the two arches (see <a href="#f0020">Figs 17.3</a>, <a href="#f0040">17.7</a>). The nerves to the mandibular arch include the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, which is mixed, and the chorda tympani, the purely sensory pretrematic branch of the facial nerve. The maxillary branch of the trigeminal and the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal are also considered to be pretrematic nerves. The ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, which supplies the frontonasal area, is not an arch nerve; in fishes, its ganglion is separate from the first arch nerve ganglion.</div><div class="text" id="p0110">The vagus nerve supplies the fourth and sixth arches (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 17.7</a>). The recurrent laryngeal branch initially loops under the sixth arch artery on both sides, but the asymmetric changes to the vascular system affect the symmetry of this nerve. On the right, when the sixth aortic arch lateral to the right pulmonary artery degenerates, the recurrent laryngeal nerve usually loops under the fourth arch-derived subclavian artery; on the left, it loops round the ductus arteriosus (which is retained as the ligamentum arteriosum in the adult).

The first aortic arch artery is part of the original vascular circuit that links the aortic sac of the heart to the paired dorsal aortae, blood returning to the heart via the allantoic, vitelline and common cardinal veins (see <a href="../B9780702077050000136/B9780702077050000136.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 13.1C</a>). As the heart descends relative to the forebrain and other rostral structures, the aortic sac (ventral aortic root) gives rise to paired aortic arches at successively more caudal levels, each of which passes laterally on each side of the pharynx to join the dorsal aortae. The dorsal aortae are not invested by neural crest cells, and nor are the more distal (cranial) parts of the carotid arteries, which form by angiogenesis (<a href="../B9780702077050000136/B9780702077050000136.xhtml">Ch. 13</a>). The whole complement of aortic arches never coexists, thus the first aortic arch degenerates through remodelling of the cranial arteries before the sixth is formed.</div><div class="text" id="p0120">When the first and second aortic arch arteries begin to regress, the blood supply to the corresponding pharyngeal arches is derived from a transient ventral pharyngeal artery, which terminates by dividing into mandibular and maxillary branches. The second aortic arch artery at first anastomoses with the ventral pharyngeal artery and passes through the mesenchyme of the stapedial cartilage, which condenses around it, forming the foramen of the stapes.</div><div class="text" id="p0125">Further development of the third, fourth and sixth aortic arches (<a href="#f0045"><span class="bold">Figs 17.8</span></a>–<a href="#f0050"><span class="bold">17.9</span></a>) produces the main arteries to the head and the great vessels arising from the heart. The common carotid artery arises from an elongation of the aortic sac, and the third arch artery becomes the proximal part of the internal carotid artery. The external carotid artery arises as a sprout from the common carotid; it incorporates the stem of the ventral pharyngeal artery, and its maxillary branch communicates with the common trunk of origin of the maxillary and mandibular branches of the stapedial artery and annexes these vessels. The proximal part of the common trunk persists as the root of the middle meningeal artery (see <a href="#f0045">Fig. 17.8</a>). More distally, the meningeal artery is derived from the proximal part of the supraorbital artery. The maxillary branch becomes the infraorbital artery and the mandibular branch forms the inferior alveolar artery. When the definitive ophthalmic artery differentiates as a branch from the terminal part of the internal carotid artery, it communicates with the supraorbital branch of the stapedial artery, which becomes the lacrimal artery distally, and retains an anastomotic connection with the middle meningeal artery.

Initially, each bud is supplied by a capillary plexus from the aortic sac. As the sixth aortic arch develops, it becomes the channel for blood from the aortic sac to the developing lung buds as well as to the corresponding dorsal aorta, the latter being the main channel. Soon after formation of the sixth aortic arch, the outflow tract of the heart is divided by an influx of neural crest cells, which form the spiral aorticopulmonary septum (<a href="#bib46" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Jiang et al 2000</a>) that separates the aortic sac into the pulmonary trunk and ascending aorta. The part of the sixth aortic arch between the pulmonary trunk and the dorsal aorta is lost on the right but on the left becomes the ductus arteriosus which remains the main channel for blood to pass from the right ventricle to the descending aorta until the lungs and their associated blood vessels expand at birth. After birth, the ductus arteriosus is functionally closed by contraction of the circular muscle of the tunica media leaving a ligamentous remnant, the ligamentum arteriosum (<a href="../B9780702077050000136/B9780702077050000136.xhtml">Ch. 13</a>) (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 17.9</a>).

As the face develops, the primitive maxillary vein extends its drainage into the territories of supply of the ophthalmic and mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve, including the pterygoid and temporal muscles, and it anastomoses with the linguofacial vein over the lower jaw. This anastomosis becomes the facial vein: it receives blood from the retromandibular vein from the temporal region, and drains through the linguofacial vein into the internal jugular vein.

The external surface ectoderm of the first arch ultimately produces the keratinized stratified squamous epithelium of the epidermis, including hair follicles, sweat and sebaceous glands, and the specialized epithelium of the vermilion part of the lips. Within the oral cavity, first arch ectoderm forms the mucous membranes of the internal surface of the lips and cheeks, the palate, the presulcal part of the tongue, the epithelial components of the salivary and mucous glands, and the enamel organs of the developing teeth (see <a href="#f0080">Figs 17.15</a>–<a href="#f0085">17.16</a>). The first pharyngeal cleft is obliterated ventrally; its dorsal end deepens to form the external acoustic meatus, including its ceruminous glands and the outer surface of the tympanic membrane (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 17.4</a>). Developmental studies of gene expression in the pharyngeal arches in chick and mouse embryos are calling into question the traditional view of pharyngeal cleft development based on external appearance. In mouse embryos the external acoustic meatus forms more rostrally from an invagination of the ectoderm of the first arch rather than at the first pharyngeal cleft (<a href="#bib99" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_99">Minoux et al 2013</a>; <a href="#bib101" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_101">Tucker 2017</a>).

The two medial nasal processes approach each other to form the nasal septum between them and extend downwards to form the premaxillary component of the upper lip and jaw and the primary palate. Concomitant with formation of the nasal processes, proliferation of the maxillary mesenchyme forms the maxillary processes that make contact with the medial and lateral nasal processes at stages 16–17 (see <a href="#f0060">Fig. 17.11</a>). Fusion of the maxillary processes with the medial nasal processes unites the premaxillary and maxillary parts of the upper jaw and lip; failure of this process on one or both sides causes unilateral or bilateral cleft lip (see <a href="#f0120">Fig. 17.18</a>). Superiorly, this fusion closes the cleft at the lower edge of the nasal pits, completing the future nostrils. Fusion of the maxillary with the lateral nasal processes is a much simpler process and rarely gives rise to anomalies.

Neurites begin to extend from the olfactory neuroblasts and reach the olfactory region of the telencephalon by stage 16. The earliest pioneer neurites cross a mesenchyme-filled gap between the placode and the brain. The remaining placodal cells differentiate into columnar supporting cells, rounded basal cells and, by invagination, the duct-lining and secretory acinar cells of the glands of Bowman. Basal infiltration by lymphocytes is a relatively late event.</div><div class="text" id="p0200">Once the nasal cavities have formed, the roof of the oral cavity is regarded as the primitive palate (not to be confused with the primary palate, which forms from the most rostral part of the primitive palate). Each nasal cavity has an arcuate shape, extending upwards over the primary palate to the differentiating olfactory epithelium and then down again towards the oral cavity, from which it is separated by an epithelial choanal membrane. Towards the end of stage 18 the choanal membranes degenerate to form internal openings, the choanae, lateral to the primary palate; the nasal cavities are now a duct from the external environment to the oral cavity. Within the nasal cavity, the non-olfactory areas of the ectodermal lining and subjacent mesenchyme differentiate to form the mucous membrane of the nasal vestibule, conchae and paranasal sinuses.</div><div class="text" id="p0205">At stage 17 the internal aspect of each maxillary process begins to bulge into the oral cavity as a palatal process; the palatal processes are the primordia of the secondary palate (<a href="#f0070"><span class="bold">Fig. 17.13</span></a>). The tongue is well developed by this stage, and its domed form fills the space between the nascent palatal shelves laterally and the primitive palate superiorly. The mandible is still short, relative to the maxillary region, and does not extend as far as the primary palate. Further growth of Meckel’s cartilages brings the mandibular region and tongue forwards, extending to a position below the primary palate. At the same time, the palatal processes continue to grow, projecting vertically downwards on either side of the tongue. At stage 23 (postfertilization days 56–58), the tongue descends and the palatal shelves rotate, bringing them to a horizontal position above the tongue (see <a href="#f0070">Fig. 17.13</a>). The rapidity of the process of shelf elevation is caused, at least in part, by swelling of the palatal mesenchyme due to accumulation and hydration of hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix (<a href="#bib27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_27">Ferguson 1991</a>). This occurs during a period of continuous growth in head height but almost no growth in head width. This latter factor is important because, if palatal shelf elevation is delayed so that it occurs during a period of growth in facial width, the unfused processes may be unable to make contact in the midline, resulting in a cleft palate (see <a href="#f0120">Fig. 17.18</a>). Other factors affecting palatal closure include the growth in length of Meckel’s cartilages and the change in position of the maxillae relative to the anterior cranial base, both having the effect of lifting the head and upper jaw away from the mandible during postfertilization weeks 9–10, facilitating withdrawal of the tongue from between the palatal shelves and creating space for their elevation. Mouth opening, tongue protrusion and hiccup movements have also been noted at this time, and it may be that these movements and their associated pressure changes assist palatal shelf elevation.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0070"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000173/main.assets/f17-13-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0070"/><a id="fspara0070"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 17.13</span> Development of the palate. <span class="bold">A</span>–<span class="bold">C</span>, Developmental progression over stages 18–23; ventral views (top row) and coronal sections (bottom row).</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0210">Midline fusion of the two palatal shelves involves adherence and breakdown (by apoptosis) of the apposed epithelial surfaces. The shelves also fuse with the posterior border of the primary palate, except over a small median area, where a nasopalatine canal maintains connection between the nasal and oral cavities for some time and marks the future position of the incisive fossa. During the period of palatal shelf development, a median downgrowth from the primitive palate forms the definitive nasal septum and is supported by cartilage. The fusing medial edges of the elevated palatal shelves also fuse with the free edge of the nasal <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="283" id="pagebreak_283"/><a id="pg283"/>septum, forming separate right and left nasal cavities above the secondary palate. The original positions of the choanae are now covered by the palatal shelves so that the nasal cavities extend from the nostrils to the free (caudal) edge of the palate at the nasopharynx. Bone forms by both intramembranous ossification within the palatal mesenchyme to form the hard palate, except near its caudal border, and by endochondral ossification of the cartilaginous nasal septum. At this time, the free edge of the palatal shelves lies directly below the former position of the attachment of the adenohypophysial (Rathke’s) pouch to the roof of the oral cavity. Caudal to the hard palate, its free edges grow to form the soft palate and uvula, which extend into the oropharynx. Myogenic mesenchyme from the first (tensor veli palatini only) and third pharyngeal arches migrates into the soft palate and around the caudal margins of the pharyngotympanic tube. Separation of the definitive nasal and oral cavities is now complete. Three elevations appear on the lateral wall of each nasal cavity: the superior, middle and inferior conchae (see <a href="#f0070">Fig. 17.13</a>). Nasal septal deviation can be identified in the fetus within the second trimester; males are apparently affected more often than females (<a href="#bib74" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_74">Salwinski et al 2010</a>).

By stage 14 three swellings are apparent: a small median elevation, the tuberculum impar or median tongue bud, and paired lateral lingual swellings distally (<a href="#f0075"><span class="bold">Fig. 17.14A</span></a>). These three swellings fuse to form the anterior two-thirds (pre-sulcal part) of the tongue (<a href="#f0075"><span class="bold">Fig. 17.14B</span></a>). A small median diverticulum, the foramen caecum (thyroid diverticulum), invaginates immediately caudal to the median tongue bud (<a href="#f0075"><span class="bold">Fig. 17.14B-C</span></a>; see <a href="#f0090">Fig. 17.19</a>). Caudal to the median tongue bud, a small swelling, the copula, forms in the floor of the second arch. The hypobranchial eminence forms in the floor of the third arch, grows over the second arch (which does not contribute to the tongue) and fuses with the anterior tongue rudiment along a V-shaped line, the sulcus terminalis, at stage 17. Another transverse groove separates the developing tongue from the caudal (fourth arch) swelling that will form the epiglottis. A sulcus forms along the ventral and lateral margins of the developing tongue and deepens, internal to the future dental laminae, to form the linguogingival sulcus (groove) (<a href="#f0075">Fig. 17.14C</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0075"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000173/main.assets/f17-14-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0075"/><a id="fspara0075"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 17.14</span> Development of the pharyngeal floor and tongue. <span class="bold">A</span>, Stage 14, showing median and lateral swellings in the floor of the first arch. <span class="bold">B</span>, After fusion of the swellings. <span class="bold">C</span>, The tongue and oropharynx at birth.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0235">The composite character of the mucous membrane of the tongue is reflected in its sensory innervation.

The third arch-derived part is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve, which invades the tissue immediately distal to the sulcus limitans, including innervation of the (cicum)vallate papillae. The vallate papillae begin to differentiate within the mucous membrane at around postmenstrual week 10 and increase in number until the end of the second trimester. The fourth arch-derived root of the tongue, near the epiglottis, is innervated by the vagus. The motor innervation is from the pharyngeal plexus (for palatoglossus) and hypoglossal nerves, which extend around and under the pharynx together with myogenic cells migrating from the occipital myotomes during stages 14–15.

Two parallel epithelial thickenings, an outer labiogingival lamina and an inner dental lamina, form around the interior border of the mouth in both upper and lower jaws (see <a href="#f0075">Fig. 17.14C</a><span class="bold">)</span>. The linguogingival sulcus is formed as an indentation between the dental lamina and the tongue. At stage 22 each labiogingival lamina indents the underlying mesenchyme to form a shallow groove that deepens to form the labiogingival sulcus between the lips and gingivae. Laterally, the epithelial lining of the oral cavity forms the inner aspect of the cheeks.</div><div class="text" id="p0245">Tooth formation involves a sequence of reciprocal interactions that are controlled by a large number of genetic factors, mediated by the extracellular matrix components of the mesenchyme and the epithelial basement membrane, including laminin, collagen IV, nidogen and <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="284" id="pagebreak_284"/><a id="pg284"/>sulphated proteoglycans (<a href="#bib79" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_79">Thesleff 2016</a>). During stage 22, 10 localized thickenings of the upper and lower dental laminae, the dental placodes, initiate formation of the dental epithelial components of the tooth primordia (<a href="#f0080"><span class="bold">Fig. 17.15A</span></a>). They expand into dental sacs surrounded by vascular mesenchyme in the bud stage (<a href="#f0080"><span class="bold">Fig. 17.15B</span></a>). The cap stage is formed around postmenstrual week 10, as the basal area of epithelium proliferates to form an enamel knot (<a href="#f0080"><span class="bold">Fig. 17.15C</span></a>). This is the signalling centre that initiates formation of the tooth crown (<a href="#bib43" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_43">Jernvall and Thesleff 2012</a>); it overlies a mesenchymal condensation, the dental papilla. Collectively, this unit constitutes a tooth germ and alveolar bone forms the tooth socket around it. The tooth germ becomes bell-shaped as the lateral and basal parts of the sac (inner and outer enamel epithelia) becomes separated by the stellate reticulum, a loose group of cells with a proteoglycan-rich extracellular matrix. The inner enamel epithelium grows rapidly and is already multi-cusped for the premolars and molars (<a href="#f0080"><span class="bold">Fig. 17.15D</span></a>) and single-cusped for the incisors and canines (<a href="#f0080"><span class="bold">Fig. 17.15E</span></a>). During the bell stage, the cells of the inner enamel epithelium differentiate into tall columnar ameloblasts, and the underlying layer of mesenchymal cells differentiates into columnar odontoblasts (<a href="#f0080"><span class="bold">Fig. 17.15F</span></a>). The odontoblasts produce and secrete dentine, which induces the ameloblasts to form enamel that is laid down in successive layers: after mineralization, it is the hardest tissue in the body. Enamel and dentine production from the bell-shaped tooth germ both begin at postmenstrual week 24 (<a href="#f0085"><span class="bold">Fig. 17.16</span></a>).

Fibronectin is present in the basement membrane of the internal enamel epithelium during the bell phase.

The parotid gland can be recognized at stage 15 as an elongated furrow running dorsally from the angle of the mouth between the mandibular and maxillary prominences. The groove, which is converted into a tube and becomes the parotid duct, loses its connection with the epithelium of the oral cavity, except at its ventral end, and extends dorsally into the soft tissue of the cheek. After fusion of the lateral parts of the maxillary and mandibular prominences, the parotid duct opens on the inside of the cheek at some distance from the angle of the mouth. As the gland develops, its branches interweave with branches of the facial nerve; it lies between the masseter and the ear by full-term and extends to cover the parotid duct during early infancy and childhood.</div><div class="text" id="p0255">The submandibular and sublingual glands form as solid diverticula that undergo branching morphogenesis, each tree-like structure later acquiring a lumen. The blind ends of the branches form acini, in which cells differentiate to form serous cells initially, and mucus-secreting cells postnatally. The submandibular gland is identifiable at stage 18 as an epithelial diverticulum into the mesenchyme from the floor of the caudal part of the linguogingival sulcus. It increases rapidly in size and branches several times. At first, the connection of the submandibular gland with the floor of the mouth lies at the side of the tongue, but as the edges of the linguogingival sulcus come together, from behind forwards, they enclose the elongating duct. The orifice of the submandibular duct is thus located progressively more distally until it is below the tip of the tongue, close to the median plane. The sublingual gland arises at stage 20 as a number of small epithelial thickenings within and lateral to the linguogingival sulcus. Each thickening canalizes separately, so multiple sublingual ducts open on the summit of the sublingual fold, while others join the submandibular duct.</div><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="285" id="pagebreak_285"/></div><div class="text" id="p0265">The minor salivary glands are distributed throughout the wall of the oral cavity, except for the gingivae and hard palate, and form in a similar manner to the major glands but undergo very little branching and remain within the submucosa.</div></section><section><a id="s0090"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0100">Lymphoid tissues</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0270">Tonsils form at several sites around the oro- and nasopharynx, where focal proliferations of endoderm become invaded by lymphoid tissue. The endodermal epithelial lining grows into the surrounding mesenchyme as a number of solid buds, which are excavated by degeneration and shedding of their central cells, forming tonsillar fossae and crypts. Lymphoid cells accumulate around the crypts at about postmenstrual weeks 17–20 and become grouped as lymphoid follicle in which T- and B-cell regions can be identified. The palatine tonsils develop from the ventral parts of the second pharyngeal pouches (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 17.4</a>). The slit-like intratonsillar cleft that extends into the upper part of the tonsil is possibly a remnant of the second pharyngeal pouch. Lymphoid tissue similar to that of the palatine tonsils is found in the first pouch (tubal tonsils), the surface of the posterior part of the tongue (lingual tonsils), and in the dorsal pharyngeal wall (adenoid or pharyngeal tonsil).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0095"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0105">Anomalies of facial development</h3></section></section><section><a id="s01120"/><section><a id="s01220"/><section><a id="s0120"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0130">Malformations involving the neural crest</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0315">Congenital malformations of the face may be initiated early, mainly related to abnormal migration, proliferation and/or apoptosis of neural crest cells, or later, during the morphogenetic phase of facial development. Craniofrontonasal syndrome is characterized by a broad forehead and hypertelorism, premature fusion of one or both coronal sutures, a central nasal groove, and sometimes cleft lip and palate; there are also extracranial features. It is caused by deletions of the gene <span class="italic">EFNB1</span>, which is known to play essential roles in boundary formation between tissues, including those between neural crest and adjacent non-crest cells (<a href="#bib82" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_82">Twigg et al 2004</a>). Mandibulofacial dysostosis (Treacher Collins syndrome) is characterized by incomplete orbits, reduced jaws and auditory ossicles (hence conductive deafness), abnormal external ears and fistulae or cysts, suggesting involvement of the first and second arch components of the cranial neural crest. It is caused by haploinsufficiency of the gene <span class="italic">TCOF1</span>. Hemifacial microsomia (Goldenhaar’s syndrome) affects only one side of the face and comprises a small mandible (sometimes with absence of the temporomandibular joint), malformed or absent ears with accessory ear tags, and facial clefts. Experimental evidence in animals suggests that it is due to haemorrhage of the stapedial artery, which may have a genetic basis. Deficient growth of the mandible (micrognathia) is usually associated with other defects. In Pierre Robin sequence (<a href="#f0115"><span class="bold">Fig. 17.17</span></a>), the small size of the mandible obstructs descent of the tongue, resulting in a U-shaped cleft palate; a conotruncal septum defect is present in one-quarter of cases, suggesting possible involvement of the cardiac neural crest.

A further consequence is the underdevelopment of the incisor-bearing part of the maxilla.

The anterior neck forms gradually, as the relatively rapid growth of the anterior structures, including the larynx, trachea, oesophagus, common carotid arteries and jugular veins, takes place. Growth of the anterior neck lifts the head to a forward-facing orientation, simultaneously increasing the angle between the spinal cord and brainstem. Growth of the first pharyngeal arch occurs at a more rapid rate than the lower arches, so that Meckel’s cartilage and the developing membrane bone of the mandible project further forwards. The hyoid bone primordium remains small, defining the future angle between the anterior neck and lower jaw. Lateral neck structures develop after the caudal edge of the second pharyngeal arch has fused with the ectoderm over the heart. Myoblasts derived from paraxial mesoderm invade the second pharyngeal arch as it forms and by this stage are present in the superficial connective tissue beneath the anterior neck skin; these spread out from the underside of the chin to the upper thorax and differentiate to form platysma. The muscle maintains the attachment of the skin beneath the lower jaw to the underlying tissues and is the main human remnant of the panniculus carnosus, the subcutaneous muscle that is present throughout the skin of many mammals.</div><div class="text" id="p0285">Arch anomalies, predominantly second arch, represent 20% of the neck masses seen in children; remnants of lower pharyngeal clefts are seen in a spectrum of anomalies presenting as branchial cysts, fistulae or sinuses. Fistulae present typically in infants and young children, and cysts in older children and adults. Both first and second cleft anomalies are classified into subtypes; on ultrasound examination they are thin-walled, anechoic and well-circumscribed, and found along the line of the original cleft (<a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_10">Adams et al 2016</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0290">There is much discussion concerning the head–trunk interface and its evolutionary progression and heterochronic development in species used in embryonic research <span class="icon1"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000173/main.assets/icon03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="icon"/></span> (<a href="../B9780702077050000884/B9780702077050000884.xhtml">Commentary 2.1</a>).

The interface between cranial nerve-innervated pharyngeal arch muscles and spinal nerve-innervated trunk muscles occurs at the lower neck and the upper parts of the pectoral girdle. While deep epaxial myotomal populations are clearly derived from somites and remain associated with developing vertebrae, the myotomal populations of the shoulder and lower neck arise from the ventrolateral border of somites adjacent to the limb bud that migrate into the limb and then back to the shoulder and lower neck region (<a href="#bib85" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_85">Valasek et al 2011</a>, <a href="#bib54" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_54">Mekonen et al 2016</a>) (<a href="../B9780702077050000185/B9780702077050000185.xhtml" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Chs 18</a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000197/B9780702077050000197.xhtml" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">19</a>). The more superficial muscles of the neck have various origins: parts of splenius, trapezius and sternocleidomastoid are derived from overlapping, undefined interfaces between the various myotomal origins in this region. The local mesenchymal populations that differentiate into endo-, peri- and epimysium, and the boundary zone of the myotendinous junction, as well as entheses and bone precursors, confer patterning information in these regions. Both the proximal and distal connections of trapezius are formed from post-otic neural crest cells, albeit with differences between avian and murine embryos (<a href="#bib51" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_51">Matsuoka et al 2005</a>).

It is first identifiable in stage 11–12 embryos as a median thickening of endoderm lying in the floor of the pharynx between the first and second pharyngeal pouches and immediately dorsal to the aortic sac. The foramen caecum is the site of a median diverticulum that appears in the furrow immediately caudal to the median tongue bud (see <a href="#f0075">Fig. 17.14B–C</a>; <a href="#f0090"><span class="bold">Fig. 17.19</span></a>). It extends caudally as the thyroglossal duct, passing ventral to the primordium of the hyoid bone and reaches the rostral border of the aortic sac by stage 15. The tip of the duct bifurcates and the tissue mass subsequently divides to form the isthmus and lateral lobes of the thyroid gland. The endoderm-derived epithelial tissue is invested by vagal neural crest mesenchyme, which gives rise to the connective tissue capsule and interlobular septa, and perifollicular mesenchyme, which carries the neurovascular and lymphatic supply to the gland. The gland has three stages of development: Stage 1 (postmenstrual weeks 10–18) is characterized by active folliculogenesis and gradual accumulation of colloid, into which the follicular cells release thyroglobulin, the substrate for tyrosine iodination and subsequent synthesis of the thyroid hormones T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>. Stage 2 (postmenstrual weeks 18–29) is quiescent, with little change in the epithelium:colloid ratio and follicular size. Stage 3 (after postmenstrual week 29) is characterized by a gradual increase in the epithelium:colloid ratio and a decrease in follicular size (<a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_13">Bocian-Sobkowska et al 1997</a>). This suggests that stimulation of the gland by pituitary-derived thyrotropin (TSH) is enhanced in the third trimester. T<sub>4</sub> is present at low levels from postmenstrual weeks 10–22, and increases during postmenstrual weeks 22–40. Normograms of fetal thyroid size from ultrasound examination between postmenstrual weeks 14–38 have been correlated to skull biparietal diameter (<a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_31">Gietka-Czernal et al 2012</a>).</div><section><a id="sf0090"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0090"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000173/main.assets/f17-17-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0090"/><a id="fspara0095"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 17.19</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, The ventral aspect of the endoderm of the pharynx, showing the pharyngeal pouches.

Each third pharyngeal pouch has dorsal and ventral sites of proliferation (see <a href="#f0090">Fig. 17.19B</a>). The epithelium on the dorsal aspect of the pouch and the region of its duct-like connection with the cavity of the pharynx becomes differentiated as the primordium of the inferior parathyroid gland (parathyroid III). Although the connection between the pouch and the pharynx is soon lost, the connection between the dorsal parathyroid and the ventral thymic rudiment of the third pharyngeal pouch persists for some time and both descend (move caudally). The superior parathyroid glands (parathyroid IV) develop from the dorsal recess of the right and left fourth pharyngeal pouches. They make contact with, and appear to be anchored by, the lateral lobes of the thyroid gland and thus remain cranial to the descended parathyroid III glands. Vagal neural crest mesenchyme provides the connective tissue elements, and invading angiogenic mesenchyme gives rise to fenestrated capillaries and lymphatics.</div><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="286" id="pagebreak_286"/></div></section><section><a id="s0130"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0140">Thymus</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0345">The thymus gland plays a pivotal role in the development of immunological competence.

It cannot be recognized prior to the differentiation of the inferior parathyroid glands at stage 16, but thereafter it is represented by two elongated diverticula that soon become solid cellular masses and grow caudally into the surrounding vagal neural crest mesenchyme. Ventral to the aortic sac, the two thymic rudiments meet but do not fuse, and they are subsequently united only by connective tissue. The thymus gland becomes located in the anterior mediastinum of the thorax once the neck is fully developed and the heart has descended (see <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0110">Fig. 23.14A, J, K</a>). The connection with the third pouch is soon lost, but the stalk may persist for some time as a solid, cellular cord.</div><div class="text" id="p0350">As the thymus proliferates and descends, the local neural crest-derived mesenchyme controls the pattern and development of the gland. Defective development of the vagal neural crest, which affects the heart and peripheral neural ganglia, also results in thymic deficiencies, as seen in DiGeorge syndrome and Pierre Robin sequence. Neural crest mesenchyme forms connective tissue septa that produce the lobulated architecture of the gland (<a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Hutchins et al 2018</a>). Angiogenic mesenchyme, including lymphoid stem cells, invades this local mesenchyme, and by postmenstrual week 10 more than 95% of the cells in the gland belong to the T-cell lineage, with a few erythroblasts and B lymphocytes. Hassall’s corpuscles are also present. By postmenstrual week 12 the mesenchymal septa, blood vessels and nerves have reached the newly differentiating medulla, which allows the entry of macrophage lineage precursors. Macrophages and interdigitating cells are first seen at postmenstrual week 14. Granulopoiesis occurs in the perivascular spaces. By postmenstrual week 17 the thymus appears fully differentiated. After this time, it produces the main type of thymocyte that is present throughout life (designated TdT<sup>+</sup>). The fetal thymus shows linear growth between postmenstrual weeks 23 and 37, correlated to estimated fetal weight. Cord blood collected at term delivery indicates higher levels of regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg cells) in fetuses showing reduced thymus growth or low fetal weight; preterm infants have higher percentages of Treg cells in cord blood. It is suggested that reduced fetal thymus growth is compensated by increased release of Treg cells to ensure suppression of autoreactivity and anti-maternal immunity (<a href="#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Diemert et al 2016</a>).

The opening into the larynx, at first a simple slit, is converted into a T-shaped cleft by the enlargement of the arytenoid swellings. The vertical limb of the T lies between the two swellings with its horizontal limb lying between the swellings and the epiglottis. The arytenoid swellings differentiate into the arytenoid and corniculate cartilages (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 17.6</a>), and the ridges that join them to the epiglottis become the definitive aryepiglottic folds, within which the cuneiform cartilages differentiate from the epiglottis.</div><div class="text" id="p0385">The lower part of the larynx, the trachea, bronchi and lungs develop from the laryngotracheal groove (<a href="../B9780702077050000203/B9780702077050000203.xhtml">Ch. 20</a>).

Superficial venous channels draining the ectoderm and outer leptomeninges gain confluence with developing radicles that will ultimately drain into the external jugular venous complex. Deeper venous plexuses lateral to the brain coalesce to form anterior, middle and posterior dural stems that join the primary head vein (see <a href="#f0055">Fig. 17.10</a>). The anterior stem drains the prosencephalon and mesencephalon, and enters the primary head vein rostral to the trigeminal ganglion. The middle stem drains the metencephalon and empties into the primary head vein caudal to the trigeminal ganglion (V) and rostral to the root of the facial nerve (VII). The posterior stem drains the myelencephalon and enters caudal to the vagus nerve (X) where the primary head vein is confluent with the precardinal vein.

The convex surface of the cerebral hemispheres and the ventral aspect of the diencephalon are drained along the ventrolateral edge by a transitory tentorial sinus, to the transverse sinus.

The boundary between neural crest and cranial mesenchyme lies between the frontal and parietal bones (coronal suture) of the calvaria. The skull base is formed by neural crest rostral to the tip of the notochord, and is sclerotome-derived (i.e. from paraxial mesenchyme) in the notochordal region (<a href="#bib52" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_52">McBratney-Owen et al 2008</a>).

The central regions of all four occipital sclerotomes contribute to the parachordal cartilage, which surrounds the notochord and extends as a flat plate on either side of it by the end of the stage 20, forming the basioccipital component of the occipital bone (see also <a href="../B9780702077050000185/B9780702077050000185.xhtml#f0070">Fig. 18.13</a>). Laterally, the exoccipital components (derived from sclerotomes 3 and 4) chondrify soon afterwards. They extend around the hindbrain to form the occipital arch, which is developmentally equivalent to the neural arch components of vertebrae. Roots of the hypoglossal nerve run between the parachordal and exoccipital cartilages, so that when the exoccipital and parachordal components fuse, they leave foramina for these nerve roots (see <a href="#f0125">Figs 17.22B</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000185/B9780702077050000185.xhtml#f0065">18.12</a>).

They unite in the median plane to form the primordium of the postsphenoid cartilage, cradling the hypophysis and retaining a perforation for the hypophysial stalk until postmenstrual weeks 10–12. This part of the basisphenoid cartilage will form the sella turcica and hypophysial fossa with the rostral presphenoid cartilages forming the jugum of the sphenoid body. This is the last part of the medial part of the skull base to differentiate as cartilage, bridging the gap between the postsphenoid and the nasal capsule.</div><div class="text" id="p0460">At stage 17 mesenchyme begins to condense and later to chondrify around the nasal pits, forming the outer part of the nasal capsule and the nasal septum. The roof of each nasal capsule is completed slightly later, when cartilage differentiates around the olfactory nerve bundles (as they extend from the nasal placode-derived olfactory epithelium) to form the cribriform plates of the ethmoid bone. During postmenstrual weeks 9–12 cartilaginous conchae form. The whole nasal capsule is well developed by the end of postmenstrual week 12, and consists of a common median septal part, sometimes initially termed the interorbitonasal septum or mesethmoid, and the outer ectethmoid. The conchae ossify during postmenstrual weeks 17–20; the superior and middle conchae form part of the ethmoid bone, and the inferior pair become separate elements. Each lateral part of the nasal capsule becomes ossified as the orbital plate and ethmoidal labyrinth, with spaces (‘cells’) that communicate with the nasal cavity and become filled with air after birth (see <a href="../B9780702077050000392/B9780702077050000392.xhtml">Ch. 39</a>). Part of the capsule remains cartilaginous as the septal and alar cartilages of the nose, and part is replaced by the intramembranous vomer and nasal bones.</div><div class="text" id="p0465">Orbital cartilages surround the eye but do not undergo ossification in their entirety. The most rostral of them becomes continuous with the presphenoid cartilage by differentiation of a cartilaginous bridge that forms the caudal boundary of the optic foramen, enclosing the optic nerve; this later ossifies to form the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone (orbitosphenoid). The greater wing of the sphenoid (alisphenoid) has both intramembranous and endochondral components; the endochondral part initially differentiates as a cartilage surrounding the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, forming the foramen ovale. This condensation extends medially to join the rostral edge of the hypophysial cartilage on each side. It also extends rostrally to surround the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve, forming the foramen rotundum. It extends laterally to join the intramembranous part of the bone, which replaces the caudal part of the orbital cartilage. The greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid are separated by the oculomotor, trochlear and abducens nerves and by the first (ophthalmic) division of the trigeminal nerve.</div><div class="text" id="p0470">The otic capsule differentiates from a mesenchymal condensation around the otocyst, after its morphogenesis to form the cochlea and semicircular canals. Differentiation of cartilage begins laterally, at the same time as the hypophysial cartilages are first detectable and is complete by stage 20. Chondrogenesis around the point of exit of the vestibulocochlear nerve creates the internal acoustic meatus. Chondrogenesis of mesenchyme around the carotid arteries joins each hypophysial cartilage to the otic capsule, forming the carotid canals. A gap occupied by the jugular vein and the glossopharyngeal, vagus and accessory nerves remains between each otic capsule and the parachordal cartilage and becomes the jugular foramen. Chondrogenesis of the mesenchyme between the separate cartilages completes formation of the cartilaginous skull base and sensory capsules, which together form a continuous framework around the pre-existing blood vessels and cranial nerves by postmenstrual week 11 (see <a href="#f0125">Fig. 17.22</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0475">Establishing the dates of ossification, endochondral or intramembranous, in fetuses is not straightforward. At the transition time, when an embryo at the end of stage 23 (postfertilization days 53–58, or postfertilization weeks 8–9, see <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 23.3</a>) becomes a fetus, the same age is then expressed from the date of the maternal last menstrual period, as postmenstrual weeks 10–11. Many schemes are used to age fetuses and it is not always clear what anthropometric units have been correlated to estimate an age given as postmenstrual weeks. Crown rump length is still used, although <a href="#bib62" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_62">O’Rahilly and Müller (1999)</a> recommended a move to greatest length; some studies age fetuses by femur length or foot length, but studies correlating these measurements to fetal age are limited. Variation of growth rate during the fetal period and differences in maternal ethnicity, height and weight affect fetal size. In this text, the postmenstrual age of fetuses based on publications has been carefully reviewed and crown rump length has been converted to postmenstrual weeks based on the fetal growth charts of <a href="#bib66" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_66">Papageorghiou et al (2014)</a> (see <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>). For these reasons the age of appearance of ossification centres are estimations only. The process of endochondral ossification in the skull is essentially the same as that of the long bones, except that each ossification centre is equivalent to a primary centre, and follows a specific programme of growth and patterning. Growth takes place within synchondroses, the cartilaginous areas between adjacent ossification centres. The first ossification centres to appear are those of the lesser and greater wings of the sphenoid, at postfertilization weeks 8 and 9, respectively. A single basisphenoid ossification centre appears at postmenstrual week 11; three presphenoid and four postsphenoid ossification centres appear at postmenstrual week 16. Bone replaces most of the cartilage until only the major synchondroses remain; these enable the endochondral skull base and sensory capsules to continue growing until they reach their final size at puberty or earlier. At birth, unossified chondrocranium persists in the alae, lateral nasal cartilage and septum of the nose, the sphenoethmoidal junction, the spheno-occipital and sphenopetrous junctions, the apex of the petrous temporal bone (foramen lacerum), and between ossification centres of the sphenoid and occipital bones. As indicated above, parts of the chondrocranium do not ossify, but are replaced by adjacent intramembranous bone, e.g. the greater wing of the sphenoid (alisphenoid). In general, endochondral ossification centres form later than intramembranous ossification sites, which first appear after stage 19.</div></section><section><a id="s0160"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0170">Calvaria</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0480">The bones of the calvaria (roof and lateral walls of the neurocranium) are formed entirely by intramembranous ossification. They are also described as dermal bones, since they are considered to be the evolutionary descendants of dermal plates formed as a protective cover for the brain in fish. In humans, as in all mammals, the major part of the calvaria is formed by paired frontal and parietal bones and the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="290" id="pagebreak_290"/><a id="pg290"/>unpaired interparietal (membranous part of the occipital bone). The squamous part of the temporal bones and the alisphenoids contribute to the lateral walls. Lineage data from mouse studies indicate that the frontal bones abutting at the metopic suture, and the squamous temporal bones are of neural crest origin; the parietals are of paraxial origin; and the interparietal is mixed (<a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Jiang et al 2002</a>). The coronal suture forms at the neural crest/paraxial mesodermal interface, as does the sagittal suture, due to a small tongue of neural crest-derived tissue lying between the two developing bones. These tissue interfaces are significant for initiating the molecular signalling system that governs growth of the calvaria. Growth at the borders of adjacent bones, i.e. in the sutures, is the major mechanism of calvarial growth. The presence of fetal dura is not required for initial suture morphogenesis, which appears to be controlled by mesenchymal cell proliferation and fibrous extracellular matrix synthesis induced by the overlapping of the advancing osteo-inductive fronts of the calvarial bones. It is thought that a signal is transferred to the underlying dura that induces changes in localized regions beneath the sutures. Once a suture has formed, it serves as a primary site for cranial bone growth and constant interaction with the dura is required to avoid ossiferous obliteration (<a href="#bib100" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_100">Opperman 2000</a>). A sequence of events that maintains a balance between cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation is mediated by an intercellular signalling system that includes the transcription factor TWIST and ligand–receptor interactions between fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs). Mutations in the genes encoding these proteins cause premature fusion of the cranial sutures (craniosynostosis), which results in deficient growth in the plane perpendicular to the suture (<a href="#f0105"><span class="bold">Fig. 17.23</span></a>; <a href="#bib56" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Morriss-Kay and Wilkie 2005</a>, <a href="#bib83" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_83">Twigg and Wilkie 2015</a>). Mutations in an increasingly large number of skull development-related genes have been identified in a quarter of craniosynostosis cases (<a href="#bib88" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_88">Wilkie et al 2017</a>). In addition to the expansion-related growth that takes place in the sutures, appositional growth, where bone is laid down on, and resorbed from, the bone surfaces, plays an important role in remodelling the calvarial bones to maintain a degree of curvature that matches the curved surface of the growing brain. Appositional growth can also provide some compensatory expansion of the skull in craniosynostosis (see <a href="#f0105">Fig. 17.23</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0105"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000173/main.assets/f17-20-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0105"/><a id="fspara0110"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 17.23</span> Craniosynostosis. <span class="bold">A</span>–<span class="bold">B</span>, Line drawings of frontal and lateral views of sagittal synostosis. <span class="bold">C</span>–<span class="bold">D</span>, Three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) scans.

They do not, as previously thought, differentiate within the mesenchyme of an ‘ectomeninx’ that surrounds the brain. As the frontal and then the parietal primordia extend upwards, the differentiating osteoblasts secrete osteoid, which then undergoes mineralization. Only the mineralized parts of the bones are detected in alizarin-stained specimens and ultrasound scans. Clear frontal bone primordia are detectable in the superciliary arch region of alizarin-stained human embryos by postfertilization week 8. As they become mineralized above this level, the parietal bone primordia can also be seen. The two bones appear to be separated by a wide gap at the coronal suture, but this gap only shows the separation of the mineralized parts of the bone and the unmineralized edge of the parietal bone actually overlaps the caudal edge of the frontal bone. After the upgrowth phase, mineralization takes place centrifugally from the central points of the frontal and parietal bones, which, by this time, form convex plates over the curvature of the underlying brain (see <a href="#f0125">Fig. 17.22D</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0490">The interparietal bone (supranuchal squamous portion of the occipital bone) forms from two ossification centres that appear by stage 23. These are considered to be homologous with the paired postparietal bones of reptiles. The fact that they unite to form a single bone in mammals may be due to the interpolation of a small area of neural crest that migrates from the hindbrain after neural tube closure (<a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Jiang et al 2002</a>). Two further ossification centres develop laterally at postmenstrual week 12. A wide gap initially occupied by cartilage between the interparietal and parietal bones disappears as the membrane bones grow towards each other, forming the lambdoid suture when they abut. The lambdoid suture contributes growth to the caudal border of the parietal bones and to the upper part of the occipital bone. Synostosis of this suture is relatively rare (fewer than 5% of craniosynostosis cases) and has a less severe effect on overall skull growth than coronal and median fusions. Between the interparietal bone and the foramen magnum, the calvaria is completed by endochondral ossification of the supraoccipital component of the occipital bone.</div><div class="text" id="p0495">In addition to the sutures that are formed where two membrane bones abut, fontanelles are formed where three or four bones meet. In the median plane, these are the anterior fontanelle, at the junction of the metopic and sagittal sutures, and the posterior fontanelle, at the junction of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures. The anterolateral fontanelle lies between the frontal, parietal, greater wing of the sphenoid and squamous temporal bones: after closure its site is the pterion. The posterolateral fontanelle lies between the parietal, petrous temporal, exoccipital and basioccipital bones; after closure, its site is the asterion. The size of the fontanelles at birth, and the timing of their closure, are highly variable. Delayed growth of the skull bones causes ossification defects, including cranium bifidum and parietal foramina, for which several genetic defects have been identified. Cleidocranial dysplasia is a defect of ossification affecting the intramembranous part of the clavicle as well as the calvaria and is caused by haploinsufficiency of the bone master gene <span class="italic">RUNX2</span>.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="291" id="pagebreak_291"/><a id="pg291"/></div></section><section><a id="s0165"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0175">Membrane bones of the face and viscerocranium</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0500">The face and viscerocranium are formed from neural crest-derived membrane bones. From forehead to chin the facial skeleton includes the frontal, lacrimal and zygomatic and nasal bones and the vomer, maxilla and mandible. The maxilla and mandible form from first arch mesenchyme, as do the medial pterygoid plates of the sphenoid bone, the palatine and the tympanic bones.</div><div class="text" id="p0505">During migration, the trigeminal neural crest cells divide into a frontonasal population that migrates superior to the eye and comes to surround the telencephalon and part of the diencephalon, a mandibular population that migrates into the first pharyngeal arch, and a maxillary population that forms the maxillary swelling (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 17.2</a>). The frontal, lacrimal, nasal bones, the vomer and the premaxillary (incisor tooth-bearing) part of the maxilla are derived from the frontonasal mesenchyme; the maxilla and zygomatic bone are derived from the maxillary mesenchyme; and the mandible and tympanic ring are derived from the mandibular mesenchyme. The maxilla and premaxilla have primary ossification centres by stages 19–20, and three further ossification centres (orbitonasal, nasopalatine and zygomatic) form in the maxillary mesenchyme around stage 23. These components fuse to form a single bone in humans, in contrast to some mammals, in which the incisor-bearing premaxillary part remains separate. By stage 23 ossification centres for most of the facial and viscerocranial bones are present, except for the tympanic ring, for which four ossification centres appear at about postmenstrual week 14. They fuse to form the sickle-shaped bone that supports the tympanic membrane (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 17.6</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0510">The mandible is the first membrane bone to begin ossification and its single ossification centre appears in stages 18–20. It is a developmentally complex bone. Although the body of the bone is formed by intramembranous ossification adjacent to Meckel’s cartilage, the coronoid region and condyle are formed by endochondral ossification in cartilage that develops after formation of the membrane bone. These secondary ossification centres form between postmenstrual weeks 10–14. Distal cartilage forms two further secondary ossification centres, the mental ossicles between postmenstrual weeks 25 and 28. This complex system enables the mandible to grow at both proximal and distal ends, analogous to a long bone.</div><div class="text" id="p0515">The temporomandibular joint forms later than other diarthrodial joints. Mesenchymal condensations of the mandibular condyle and zygomatic process of the squamous part of the temporal bone are present between stages 21–23. Joint capsule development begins at this stage; the inferior joint cavity appears at the end of postfertilization week 9, when the articular disc can be seen and chondrogenesis commences in the mandibular condyle. The superior joint cavity is seen from postfertilization week 11. Buccal movements, seen from postfertilization weeks 7–8, are thought to be important for the development of the joint. The posterior region of the joint is associated with the tympanosquamosal fissure; Meckel’s cartilage, the discomalleolar ligament, chorda tympani nerve and anterior tympanic blood vessels pass through it. Intramembranous ossification of the area of insertion of lateral pterygoid begins during postmenstrual week 13 and endochondral ossification of the condylar cartilage is seen from postmenstrual week 17 (<a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Carvalho de Moraes et al 2015</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0170"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0180">Antenatal ultrasound imaging of the head and neck</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0520">The fetal head appears oval on transthalamic and transventricular planes and is symmetric and broader posteriorly (see <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0030">Fig. 23.5</a>).

During the neonatal period, when the baby cries and intracranial pressure rises, the overlapping bones slide apart, increasing the fronto-occipital diameter of the skull. Growth at the coronal suture provides the major increase in the fronto-occipital plane of the calvaria. Premature synostosis of the coronal sutures restricts growth in this plane, causing brachycephaly; unilateral coronal synostosis leads to plagiocephaly, in which one side of the skull fails to grow in the fronto-occipital plane. Uni- and bilateral coronal synostosis comprises 20–25% of all forms of craniosynostosis.</div><div class="text" id="p0545">Postnatal growth of the skull is characterized by changing proportions of its components and the extremely rapid growth of the brain in the first 2 postnatal years. The metopic and sagittal sutures are formed when the upwardly extending frontal and parietal bones, respectively, abut in the median plane. Growth within these sutures increases the breadth of the skull. The timing of fusion of the metopic suture is variable, but is complete by the end of the first year in most infants. Premature fusion of the sagittal suture results in the formation of a narrow, elongated skull. Sagittal synostosis is the most common form of craniosynostosis (40–55%). The sagittal suture continues as an active growth centre until puberty, with remodelling of the frontal bones mediated by appositional growth.</div><div class="text" id="p0550">The paranasal sinuses begin to form in late fetal life as diverticula from the nasal cavity that gradually invade the maxilla, frontal, ethmoid and sphenoid bones. At birth, small ethmoidal and maxillary sinuses are present and become pneumatized during the first postnatal month; pneumatization of the sphenoid bone begins around postnatal month 4. The frontal sinus remains an out-pouching from the nasal cavity to term delivery, developing over the first 2 postnatal years; it is fully pneumatized by 14–15 years (<a href="#bib50" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_50">Ma et al 2013</a>). Thickening of the skull bones is accompanied by increasing size of the sinuses, and by a change in form of the sutures, from straight to wavy lines and, finally, to the complex interdigitations seen in the adult. After growth ceases, the skull sutures contain inert connective tissue and some cartilage; in old age, some of them are completely replaced by bone (natural synostosis).</div><div class="text" id="p0555">The inner ear and the temporal bone grow very little after birth, so the increasing breadth of the skull draws the petrous temporal bone out laterally, creating the bony external acoustic meatus. The tympanic ring (with the tympanic membrane) lies at the surface of the meatus in the neonatal skull and remains at the proximal (inner) end of the deepening canal. The squamous temporal bone increases in size so that it contributes a greater proportion of the calvaria at puberty and in the adult than in the neonate (<a href="#f0130"><span class="bold">Fig. 17.24</span></a>). By postnatal year 2 the mastoid process of the temporal bone has developed air-filled spaces (mastoid air cells) that are continuous with the middle ear cavity.</div><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0130"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000173/main.assets/on17-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0125"/><a id="fspara0130"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 17.24</span> During postnatal growth of the skull, the viscerocranium increases in size relative to the neurocranium.

At full-term birth, each quadrant of the jaws has five unerupted deciduous teeth and the germs of the first five permanent teeth. Permanent teeth develop in accessional positions from the lingual aspects of the deciduous tooth germs and, for the 12 permanent molar teeth, from posterior extensions of the dental laminae on each side of both jaws (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 17.16</a>). Mineralization begins in both deciduous and permanent teeth before birth. The deciduous teeth have well-developed crowns by full term: eruption through the gingivae usually begins with the lower incisors between postnatal months 3–6. After eruption, the gingivae remain attached to the neck of each tooth by the upper part of the periodontal ligament, while the major part of the ligament attaches the tooth root to the bone of the tooth socket. The type of transition to extrauterine life is permanently recorded in the primary teeth and can be reliably demonstrated in forensic dental identification. The circadian growth rhythm of dentine and enamel deposition in tooth germs is temporarily blocked by the metabolic stress of delivery; the resultant change in enamel prism deposition is seen as a neonatal line or ring that can be detected in all deciduous teeth and permanent first molar teeth of live births. The thickness of the line is related to birth difficulties, being thinner in caesarean section and thicker in vaginal delivery (<a href="#bib73" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_73">Sabel et al 2008</a>, <a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Canturk et al 2014</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0565">During the first 5 years there is as much anteroposterior as vertical growth of the maxilla, after which there is relatively more vertical growth. Growth of the face occurs in the sutures between the membrane bones in a similar manner to that of the calvarial sutures. Postnatally, the face grows more rapidly than the calvaria, in contrast to the fetal period during which rapid growth of the brain has a dominant influence on regional skull growth. Habitual mouth breathing due to nasal obstruction may cause variable adaptation of facial muscles leading to anomalous maxillary or mandibular growth in children; lower anterior facial height (philtrum to midline mandibular distance), is greater in mouth breathers, in whom the mandible may be smaller with less rotation (<a href="#bib76" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_76">Souki et al 2012</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0570">In the full-term neonate there is no space between the hard palate and the tongue when the mouth is closed, which means that the entire surface of the neonatal tongue, which is short and broad, lies within the oral cavity. The oropharynx and nasopharynx join without any sharp junctional demarcation to a pharynx that is one-third of the relative length seen in the adult. By 5 years of age an oblique angle is formed at this junction, and in the adult, the nasopharynx and oropharynx join at almost a right-angle. The hyoid bone and larynx are initially relatively high and the epiglottis may extend above the soft palate with the laryngeal airway in directly continuous with the posterior nares (see <a href="../B9780702077050000409/B9780702077050000409.xhtml#f0070">Fig. 40.11</a>). The hyoid bone and larynx descend during the first postnatal year and by the fourth or fifth year, form part of the anterior wall of the oropharynx (see <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0120">Fig. 23.15</a>). The anatomical arrangement of the laryngeal structures enables the infant to breathe while suckling, as milk passes on either side of the laryngeal opening to reach the oesophagus (see <a href="../B9780702077050000409/B9780702077050000409.xhtml#f0065">Fig. 40.12</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0575">During breastfeeding, three oral spaces are identified, a median space between the tongue and hard palate occupied by the nipple when suckling and which bifurcates posteriorly to produce channels on each side of the soft palate and epiglottis, and two lateral spaces, the lateral arcuate cavities, that are formed between the tongue and cheeks. The upper and lower gingivae within these spaces do not touch during suckling. The hard palate is only slightly arched and its mucous membrane is corrugated by five or six irregular transverse folds (rugae) that assist with gripping the nipple. Each cheek is supported by a mass of subcutaneous fat, the suctorial pad, that lies between buccinator and masseter. Studies on the biomechanical processes of milk extraction during breastfeeding have shown that balanced postnatal muscular development is promoted by forward movement of the mandible and raising and lowering the tongue. Tongue movements can generate vacuum pressures of some <span>−</span>145<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mmHg: tongue lowering decreases the pressure. In bottle feeding the main action the infant uses is sucking and the tongue only controls the milk outlet through bilateral contraction of buccinator. Children who have never breastfed have a greater prevalence of posterior cross bite in both mixed and permanent dentition and of abnormal swallowing patterns and mouth breathing (which may also have compromised occlusal development) than children who have breastfed for more than 6 months postnatally (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Chen et al 2015</a>, <a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Boronat-Catalá et al 2017</a>). Preterm infants have poor suck–swallow–breathe coordination and an inability to generate adequate vacuum strength (<a href="#bib30" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_30">Geddes et al 2017</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0580">Non-nutritive sucking does not appear to act in synergy with breastfeeding to promote malocclusion. It is seen as early at postmenstrual weeks 13–16 and considered a normal part of fetal and neonatal development. A sucking reflex remains to 12 postnatal months after which time the infant has learned to feed (<a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_28">Feştilă et al 2014</a>). Infantile swallowing, with the jaws apart and lip musculature forming a tight contact around the mother’s breast, is different to the adult swallowing pattern with the lips relaxed, teeth together and the tongue against the hard palate. The transition from infant to adult swallowing is usually present by 9–10 years; it is never achieved by 10–15% of the population (<a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Feştilă et al 2014</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0585">Structures that descend to the mediastinum are considered in <a href="../B9780702077050000203/B9780702077050000203.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>. Within the neck in the full-term neonate, the trachea is relatively small in relation to the larynx; it has thicker walls and cartilage plates that are relatively closer together than in the adult. It commences at the upper border of the sixth cervical vertebra, a relationship that is conserved with growth. It bifurcates at the level of the thoracic vertebrae 3 or 4, descending to lie level with the upper border of the thoracic vertebra 5 in the adult (endotracheal intubation in the neonate is described in <a href="../B9780702077050000203/B9780702077050000203.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>). In extremely preterm infants, later phonation and voice quality appears to be affected by supraglottic hyperfunction, a secondary response to structural laryngeal pathology caused by neonatal intubation (<a href="#bib68" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_68">Reynolds et al 2016</a>). The prevalence of voice anomalies is reported to be above 50% in children intubated for longer than 28 days in the neonatal period (<a href="#bib39" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_39">Hseu et al 2018</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0590">The thyroid gland is relatively large in the neonate, where it has a long, narrow isthmus connecting lobes that do not yet contact the upper part of the trachea. Thyroid volume at birth varies due to variations in maternal iodine intake; the volume is lower at postmenstrual week 36, in preterm infants delivered before postmenstrual week 28, than in infants delivered at full term (<a href="#bib59" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_59">Ng et al 2018</a>). It usually attains half the adult size by 2 years of age. The parathyroid glands are as variable in size and position as they are in the adult. They double in size between birth and puberty. Parathyroid hormone (parathormone, PTH) is produced from postmenstrual week 12. It is essential for calcium homeostasis and is involved in the remodelling of growing bones.</div><div class="text" id="p0595">The oesophagus begins and ends one to two vertebral levels higher than in the adult, extending from between the fourth and sixth cervical vertebrae to the level of the ninth thoracic vertebra. The narrowest constriction is at its junction with the pharynx, where the inferior pharyngeal constrictor constricts the lumen; in this region there is a risk it may be traumatized with medical instruments or catheters. The pharyngo-oesophageal phase of swallowing is controlled by multiple afferent and efferent cranial nerves, excitatory and inhibitory neurones and central pattern generators. In the preterm infant oromotor inertia, oral pooling and delayed initiation of the pharyngeal phase of swallowing can cause cough with feeding, wet gurgly breathing and nasopharyngeal regurgitation. Laryngeal penetration and aspiration, where food passes into the laryngeal vestibule above the level of the vocal folds or between the true vocal folds, respectively, can breach airway protection reflexes. About 25% of preterm infants show dysphagia; the incidence of laryngeal aspiration ranges from 25% to 85% in infants with swallowing dysfunction.
