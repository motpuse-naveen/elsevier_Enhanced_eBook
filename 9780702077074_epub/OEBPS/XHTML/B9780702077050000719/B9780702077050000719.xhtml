It extends from the inlet whose defining plane runs from the superior pubic rami to the sacral promontory. The outlet spans the area between the inferior pubic rami and distal sacrum. The inner walls of the true pelvis are covered by the obturator internus and piriformis muscles. The pelvis contains the excretory organs in both sexes (urinary bladder and urethra; rectum and anus) and some of the reproductive organs. The opening within the pelvic cavity is spanned by the levator ani muscles that form the ‘pelvic floor’ whose anteriorly placed hiatus allows the urethra, vagina (in the female) and anus to exit the body. Below and surrounding the hiatus lie the perineal membrane and the external genitalia with their associated muscles. The complex and highly variable internal iliac vasculature fans out from a single internal iliac vessel entering the pelvis at the sacroiliac articulation to supply the organs and muscles filling the pelvic cavity. The sacral ventral rami exit the anterior sacral foramina to lie on the inner surface of piriformis, giving off branches to the pelvic organs and muscles before forming the sacral plexus and exiting through the greater sciatic foramen.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">internal iliac vessels; levator ani muscles; perineal membrane; sacral plexus and nerves; true pelvis</div></section>--><section><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Lesser Pelvis</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The lesser pelvis is a bowl-shaped structure formed from the sacrum, pubis, ilium, ischium, the ligaments that interconnect these bones, and the muscles that line their inner surfaces. It begins at the level of the plane passing through the promontory of the sacrum, the arcuate line of the ilium, the pecten pubis and the posterior surface of the pubic crest. This plane, or ‘inlet’, lies at an angle of between 35° and 50° up from the horizontal; the bony structures above it are sometimes referred to as the greater pelvis. They form part of the walls of the lower abdomen. In children, the width of the pelvic inlet is an age-independent predictor of chest width and thoracic dimensions (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">Emans et al 2005</a>). The ischiopubic synchondrosis is the temporary cartilage formed between the pubis and ischium prior to the completion of ossification around 12 years of age (<a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_14">Herneth et al 2000</a>). The ‘outlet’ of the lesser pelvis is formed by the ischiopubic rami, ischial tuberosities, sacrotuberous ligaments and distal sacrum. The bones surround a central pelvic canal that forms an anteriorly concave curve (the curve of Carus); in the female, it constitutes the birth canal. The topography of the bony and ligamentous pelvis is considered in full detail in <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml">Chapter 77</a>.</div><section><a id="s0015"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0025">Muscles and fasciae</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0030">Pelvic muscles</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0020"/><div class="textfl" id="p0015">The muscles arising within the pelvis form two groups.

It passes out of the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen superior to the sacrospinous ligament. Within the pelvis, the posterior surface of this muscle lies against the sacrum, and its anterior surface is related to the rectum (especially on the left), the sacral plexus and branches of the internal iliac vessels.

These structures are also attached to the medial part of the pelvic surface of the obturator membrane. Specialized portions of the obturator fascia give attachment to some of the fibres of levator ani (tendinous arch of levator ani), so that only the superior portion of obturator internus can be seen from above. The inferior portion forms part of the boundaries of the ischio-anal fossa. In the male, the superior portion lies lateral to the urinary bladder, the obturator and vesical vessels, and the obturator nerve.

). The muscle is subdivided into named portions according to their attachments and the pelvic viscera to which they are related (pubococcygeus, iliococcygeus and pubo-analis). These parts are often referred to as separate muscles but the boundaries between them cannot easily be distinguished; moreover, they perform many similar physiological functions. Pubococcygeus is often subdivided into separate parts according to the pelvic viscera to which each part relates (e.g. puboprostaticus, pubovaginalis). Levator ani arises from each side of the walls of the pelvis along the condensation of the obturator fascia (the tendinous arch of levator ani). Fibres from ischiococcygeus attach to the sacrum and coccyx but the remaining parts of the muscle converge in the midline. Fibres from iliococcygeus join via a partly fibrous intersection and form the iliococcygeal raphe posterior to the anorectal junction. Closer to the anorectal junction, and elsewhere in the pelvic diaphragm, the fibres are nearly continuous with those of the opposite side, such that the muscle forms a sling (iliococcygeus and pubo-analis).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0020"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000719/main.assets/f71-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0020"/><a id="fspara0020"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 71.3</span> Muscles of the female pelvis viewed from above.

Its most medial fibres run directly lateral to the urethra and its sphincter as it passes through the pelvic diaphragm; here, the muscle is correctly called puboperinealis, although it is often referred to as pubo-urethralis because of its juxtaposition to the proximal half of the urethra in both sexes, however, no direct connection with the urethra is present. In males, some of these fibres lie lateral and inferior to the prostate and are referred to as puboprostaticus. In females, fibres run further back and attach to the lateral walls of the vagina, where they are referred to as pubovaginalis. In both sexes, fibres from this part of pubococcygeus attach to the perineal body; a few elements also attach to the anorectal junction. Some fibres decussate and blend with the longitudinal rectal muscle and fascial elements to contribute to the conjoint longitudinal coat of the anal canal. Behind the rectum, other fibres of pubococcygeus form a tendinous intersection as part of the anococcygeal raphe.</div></section><section><a id="s0060"/><p class="h8hd" id="cesectitle0060">Iliococcygeus</p><div class="textfl" id="p0045">Iliococcygeus is attached to the inner surface of the ischial spine inferior and anterior to the attachment of ischiococcygeus, and also to the tendinous arch of levator ani as far anteriorly as the obturator canal (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 71.2</a>). The most posterior fibres are attached to the apex of the sacrum and coccyx, but the majority join fibres from the contralateral side to form a raphe that is effectively continuous with the fibroelastic anococcygeal ligament, which is closely applied to its inferior surface; some muscle fibres may attach into the ligament. The raphe provides a strong attachment for the pelvic diaphragm posteriorly and must be divided to allow wide excisions of the anorectal canal to be performed during abdominoperineal excisions for malignancy. An accessory slip sometimes arises from the most posterior part and is referred to as iliosacralis.</div></section><section><a id="s0065"/><p class="h8hd" id="cesectitle0065">Pubo-analis</p><div class="textfl" id="p0050">Pubo-analis lies lateral to pubococcygeus and cannot be seen from inside the pelvis. It originates from the inner surface of the ischiopubic rami immediately adjacent to, and sometimes partly arising from, the perineal membrane. Its fibres pass lateral to those of iliococcygeus and pubococcygeus to decussate posterior to the rectum at the anorectal junction. The border between pubo-analis and some fibres of the external anal sphincter is indistinct.</div></section><section><a id="s0070"/><p class="h8hd" id="cesectitle0070">Ischiococcygeus</p><div class="textfl" id="p0055">Ischiococcygeus lies posterosuperior to and is contiguous with levator ani. It arises as a triangular musculotendinous sheet with its apex attached to the pelvic surface and tip of the ischial spine, and its base attached to the lateral margins of the coccyx and the fifth sacral vertebral segment. Ischiococcygeus is rarely absent, but can be almost completely tendinous rather than muscular. It lies on the pelvic aspect of the sacrospinous ligament and can be fused with it, particularly if it is mostly tendinous. The sacrospinous ligament may represent either a degenerate part or an aponeurosis of the muscle, since muscle and ligament are coextensive.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0075"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0075">Relations</p><div class="textfl" id="p0060">The superior, pelvic surface of levator ani is separated only by fascia (superior pelvic diaphragmatic, visceral and extraperitoneal) from the urinary bladder, prostate or uterus and vagina, rectum and peritoneum. Its inferior, perineal surface forms the medial wall of the ischio-anal fossa and the superior wall of the anterior recess of the fossa, both being covered by the inferior fascia of the pelvic diaphragm. The posterior border is separated from the coccyx by areolar tissue. The medial borders of the two levator muscles and the inferior ischiopubic rami border the levator hiatus, through which pass the urethra, vagina (in the female) and anus. In the female, that portion of the hiatus that lies anterior to the perineal body is referred to as the urogenital hiatus.</div></section><section><a id="s0080"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0080">Vascular supply</p><div class="textfl" id="p0065">Levator ani is supplied by branches of the inferior gluteal, inferior vesical and internal pudendal arteries.</div></section><section><a id="s0085"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0085">Innervation</p><div class="textfl" id="p0070">The nerves to levator ani originate mainly from the third and fourth sacral ventral (anterior) rami, with lesser contributions from the second sacral ventral ramus. These nerves enter the pelvis just above ischiococcygeus, sometimes piercing it, to pass along the anterior surface of ischiococcygeus and pubococcygeus, supplying these muscles and sending fibres to pubo-analis (<a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">Roberts and Krishingner 1967</a>, <a href="#bib46" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_46">Sato 1980</a>).

In the female, this action occludes the vagina and prevents prolapse of the pelvic organs through the urogenital hiatus. The constant baseline activity of levator ani is similar to that of the external anal sphincter, modulated to adjust to the loads placed on them. The action of pubo-analis and pubococcygeus also reinforces the external anal sphincter and helps to create the anorectal angle. Iliococcygeus and to a lesser extent the less muscular ischiococcygeus form a relatively horizontal diaphragm, especially in the posterior half of the pelvis, that assists pubo-analis in achieving bowel and bladder continence.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1246" id="pagebreak_1246"/><a id="pg1246"/></div><div class="text" id="p0080">Levator ani must relax appropriately to permit expulsion of urine and, particularly, faeces; it contracts with the abdominal muscles and the respiratory diaphragm to raise intra-abdominal pressure. It forms much of the muscular pelvic diaphragm, which supports the pelvic viscera. Like the respiratory diaphragm, but unlike the abdominal muscles, levator ani is also active in the inspiratory phase of quiet respiration. In pregnancy, the shape of the pelvic diaphragm can help to direct the fetal head into the anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic outlet.</div></section></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0095"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0095">Pelvic fasciae</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0085">It is convenient to divide the pelvic fasciae into the parietal pelvic fascia, which forms the coverings of the pelvic muscles, and the visceral pelvic fascia, which forms the coverings of the pelvic organs and their neurovascular supply (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 71.4</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0025"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000719/main.assets/f71-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0025"/><a id="fspara0025"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 71.4</span> Fasciae of the male pelvis and perineum: median sagittal section.

In humans, anterior to the lateral attachment of the pelvic organs, a portion of it is derived from the degenerated superior portion of the attachment of levator ani. It is connected to the posterior part of the arcuate line of the ilium and is continuous with iliac fascia. Anterior to this, as it follows the line of origin of obturator internus, it is gradually separated from the attachment of the iliac fascia and a portion of the periosteum of the ilium and pubis spans between them. It arches below the obturator vessels and nerve, investing the obturator canal, and is attached anteriorly to the posterior aspect of the pubis. Behind the obturator canal, the fascia is markedly aponeurotic and gives a firm attachment to the iliococcygeus, usually called the tendinous arch of levator ani (see <a href="#f0020">Figs 71.3</a>, <a href="#f0060">71.14</a>–<a href="#f0065">71.15</a>). Superior to the attachment of levator ani, the fascia is thin and effectively comprises only the epimysium of the muscle and overlying connective tissue; posteriorly, it forms part of the lateral wall of the ischio-anal fossa in the perineum; anteriorly, it merges with the fasciae of the muscles of the deep perineal space, which is continuous with the ischio-anal fossa. The obturator fascia is continuous with the periosteum of the hip bone and piriformis fascia.</div></section><section><a id="s0110"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0110">Fascia over piriformis</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0100">The fascia over the internal surface of piriformis is very thin and fuses with the periosteum on the anterior sacrum at the margins of the anterior sacral foramina. It ensheathes the ventral rami that emerge from these foramina so that the nerves are often described as lying behind the fascia. The internal iliac vessels lie in front of the piriformis fascia and their branches draw out sheaths of the fascia and extraperitoneal tissue into the gluteal region, superior and inferior to piriformis.</div></section><section><a id="s0115"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0115">Fascia over levator ani</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0105">Both surfaces of levator ani have a fascial covering: the combination of the two fascial layers and the intervening muscle is called the pelvic diaphragm. On the inferior surface, the fascia is continuous with the obturator fascia below the tendinous arch of levator ani laterally. It covers the medial wall of the ischio-anal fossa and blends below with fasciae on the external urethral sphincter and the external anal sphincter. The superior fascia of the pelvic diaphragm is markedly thicker than the inferior fascia and is attached anteriorly to the posterior aspect of the body of the pubis, approximately 2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm superior to its inferior border. It extends laterally across the superior pubic ramus, blending with the obturator fascia and continuing along an irregular line to the ischial spine. It is continuous posteriorly with the piriformis fascia and the anterior sacrococcygeal ligament.

It provides attachment for the condensations of visceral pelvic fasciae that provide support to the urethra and urinary bladder, and to the vagina in females (see below).</div></section><section><a id="s0125"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0125">Presacral fascia</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0115">The presacral fascia forms a hammock-like structure behind the posterior portion of the mesorectal fascia. Laterally, it extends to the origin of the piriformis fascia and the superior fascia of the pelvic diaphragm, with which it blends; more inferiorly, it extends between the white line of the parietal pelvic fascia on either side. Inferiorly, it extends to the anorectal junction, where it fuses with the posterior aspect of the mesorectal fascia and the iliococcygeal raphe at the level of the anorectal junction. Superiorly, it can be traced to the origin of the superior hypogastric plexus, where it thins progressively over the sacral promontory and becomes continuous with the retroperitoneal tissues. The right and left hypogastric nerves and inferior hypogastric plexuses lie on its surface. It forms a distinct layer that can be seen both on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis and during surgery. The presacral fascia provides an important landmark because extension of rectal tumours through it significantly reduces the possibility of curative resectional surgery. Dissection in the plane posterior to the fascia can result in bleeding from the presacral veins. The adventitia of the veins is partly attached to the posterior surface of the fascia, which means that the haemorrhage can be severe (because the veins are unable to contract properly). The presacral fascia is a useful structure to which the rectum can be sutured during rectopexy for rectal prolapse.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0130"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0130">Visceral pelvic fascia</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0120">The urogenital organs in both sexes are connected bilaterally to the pelvic walls by neurovascular mesenteric condensations ensheathed by a <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1247" id="pagebreak_1247"/><a id="pg1247"/>meshwork of loose connective and adipose tissues and lying above the perineal membrane (<a href="#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_38">Ricci et al 1947</a>, <a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_1">Campbell 1950</a>, <a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Range and Woodburne 1964</a>, <a href="#bib42" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_42">Roberts et al 1964</a>, <a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">Reiffstuhl 1982</a>). The lateral attachments of the pelvic organs to the pelvic side walls are referred to as the endopelvic fascia. Considered as a unit, the connections provide a conduit for neurovascular elements passing from the pelvic side wall to the organs and serve as attachments that help to retain the pelvic organs in place, playing an important role in preventing pelvic organ prolapse in females (<a href="#bib5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_5">DeLancey 1992</a>). They are associated with loose connective tissue that extends to the midline, separating the bladder from the vagina and the vagina from the rectum in the female, and separating the bladder, prostate and seminal glands from the rectum in the male. The fasciae contain different amounts of connective tissue and smooth muscle: where they are either unusually dense or form visible ridges, they are called ‘ligaments’ (e.g. cardinal ligament, uterosacral ligament). Clinically, these lateral attachments are often referred to as visceral ‘ligaments’, but they are quite unlike the bands of dense, regular connective tissue that typify skeletal ligaments. Their lateral attachments sweep off the pelvic walls, arising from the superior fascia over levator ani and from part of the piriformis fascia more superiorly and posteriorly. The ligaments passing to the urinary bladder in the male, or the bladder and proximal vagina and uterus in the female, are relatively long, but these lateral connections become shorter towards the pelvic outlet, until at the level of the perineal membrane there is a direct connection between the organs and the pelvic walls.</div><div class="text" id="p0125">In the female, the cardinal ligament surrounds the uterovaginal junction and extends distally to mid-vagina, where the vagina has a more direct lateral attachment at the tendinous arch of the pelvic fascia. The portions that attach to the uterus and vagina are sometimes called the parametrium and paracolpium, respectively. Further accounts of the paravisceral portions of the visceral pelvic fascia are given in the chapters describing the organs to which the fascia relates. The uterosacral ligament is a visible fold of tissue flanking the rectum as it descends posterior to the cervix in the female. It contains a considerable amount of smooth muscle near its attachment to the cervix and some of the pelvic autonomic nerves. A similar vesicosacral fold is present in the male.</div><div class="text" id="p0130">Approximately 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm above the inferior border of the pubis and 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm lateral to the midline, a band of dense pelvic connective tissue, the anterior end of the tendinous arch of the pelvic fascia, is attached to either the paravaginal (female) or the prostatic (male) tissues. This band extends on the inner surface of levator ani and joins the tendinous arch of levator ani to the ischium, just above the ischial spine. The attachment of the paravaginal tissue to the pubis is sometimes called the pubo-urethral ligament, a misnomer because it is not attached to the urethra.

The striated urogenital sphincter has an upper circular element that surrounds the urethra in the female and the apex of the prostate in the male, between the neck of the bladder and perineal membrane.

Continence is maintained by an elegantly orchestrated system of muscles and connective tissues that involves the urethral sphincters and the tissues that support them. The urethral sphincter mechanism compresses the mid-urethra in females and the membranous urethra in males, particularly when the bladder contains urine. Its location around the region of highest urethral closing pressure suggests it is important in urinary continence. At rest, activity <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1256" id="pagebreak_1256"/><a id="pg1256"/>of both the smooth and striated sphincters contributes to this closure and, during times of increased need, voluntary contraction of the striated sphincter augments this closure. In the distal portion of the urethra, where it is adjacent to the perineal membrane, arch-shaped components of the striated sphincter (compressor urethrae and sphincter urethrovaginalis) pass between the urethra and pubis, and contraction compresses the lumen until it is closed. All muscles are relaxed during micturition to aid voiding: striated muscle contraction can help to expel the final drops of urine or semen from the proximal spongy urethra in the male.</div><div class="text" id="p0575">During increases in abdominal pressure that occur, for example, during a cough, urinary bladder pressure rises above the urethral closure pressure that normally keeps the lumen of the urethra closed. In this situation, the urethral closure pressures that prevent urine leakage rise because the urethra is compressed against the fascial tissues that lie between it and the vaginal wall. If this layer is stable and unyielding, the urethra can be compressed closed against it, but if it is not well supported, this mechanism is less effective and leakage can occur (<a href="#bib6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_6">DeLancey 1994</a>).

During dissections of the anal canal, particularly during perineal excisions of the anus or rectum, the inferior anorectal vessels are encountered in the ischio-anal fossa and must be ligated before division; otherwise they tend to retract laterally, where they can cause troublesome bleeding.</div></section><section><a id="s0650"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0540">Perineal artery</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0660">The perineal artery is a branch of the internal pudendal artery that arises near the anterior end of the pudendal canal and runs through the perineal membrane. In the male, it approaches the scrotum in the superficial perineal space, between bulbospongiosus and ischiocavernosus (see <a href="../B9780702077050000744/B9780702077050000744.xhtml#f0095">Fig. 74.24</a>). A small transverse branch passes medially, inferior to the superficial transverse perineal muscle, to anastomose with the contralateral artery and with the posterior scrotal and inferior anorectal arteries. It supplies the transverse perinei, the perineal body and the posterior attachment of the bulb of the penis. The posterior scrotal arteries are usually terminal branches of the perineal artery but can also arise from its transverse branch. They are distributed to the scrotal skin and dartos in the male and supply the perineal muscles. In the female, the perineal artery runs an almost identical course to that in the male and gives off posterior labial branches (see <a href="../B9780702077050000756/B9780702077050000756.xhtml#f0025">Fig. 75.4</a>).</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0655"/><hgroup><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0545">Veins</h4><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle9145">Internal pudendal veins</h5></hgroup><section><a id="s6655"/><div class="textfl" id="p0665">The internal pudendal veins are venae comitantes of the internal pudendal artery and unite as a single vessel ending in the internal iliac vein.

The pudendal nerve occupies a constant position over the ischial spine.

The nerve crosses the ischio-anal fossa to supply the external anal sphincter, the lining of the distal part of the anal canal and the skin around the anus. It frequently breaks into terminal branches before reaching the lateral border of the external anal sphincter. Its cutaneous branches distributed around the anus overlap the branches of the perineal branch of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve and of the posterior scrotal or labial nerves.

The posterior scrotal or labial nerves are usually double; they have medial and lateral branches that run over the perineal membrane and pass anteriorly in the lateral part of the urogenital triangle with the posterior scrotal or posterior labial branches of the perineal artery. They supply the skin of the scrotum or labia majora, respectively, overlapping the distribution of the perineal branch of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve and inferior anal nerve. In females, the posterior labial branches also supply sensory fibres to the skin of the distal vagina.</div><div class="text" id="p0690">Muscular branches arise directly from the pudendal nerve to supply the superficial transverse perineal muscles, bulbospongiosus, ischiocavernosus, external urethral sphincter and the anterior parts of the external anal sphincter and levator ani.
