Guided by Imaging Editor Dr Tom Turmezei, these include cutting-edge images that showcase the impact of radiology on anatomical education, harnessing different modalities and image processing techniques to show living internal human anatomy in detail. In particular, we would like to thank consultant radiologists Tariq Ali, Phyllis Mezue and Iztok Caglic; musculoskeletal radiology clinical fellow Elliott Rees; and radiology trainees Julia Sun, Ramona-Rita Barbara, Fatma Eminaga, Amr Moussa, Nathan Chan and Emily Pearlman.</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0015">The following images were sourced by the Department of Radiology at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital:</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0090">33.1B,C; 33.2B; 33.3B; 34.1C; 34.2B; 34.3B; 34.4C; 35.4C; 35.24H-L; 37.11B; 37.40B,C; 37.41; 37.45D,E; 38.14C–E; 39.6B–F; 40.2B; 41.6B; 44.5B; 44.6C; 44.7B; 44.13B–E; 46.6B,C; 46.20C; 46.23B; 46.25B,C; 46.27B,C; 46.44B; 46.45; 46.46A–C; 46.51C–G; 46.60B–D; 46.63B,C; 46.66B; 46.74; 47.1G; 48.3B–D; 48.4B–E; 48.7B–G; 49.15B; 49.22C; 49.23A,B; 49.30B; 50.13E–G; 50.16; 50.17B; 50.27B; 50.31B; 50.32B; 51.19D; 51.20A–D; 52.2B; 53.12B; 54.4C–H; 54.5B; 54.6F–O; 55.1B–E; 56.9B–E; 57.4F; 57.7BC; 57.17B; 57.21B; 57.27B; 57.46; 57.47; 57.48; 57.49; 57.50; 57.51; 57.59C; 58.3; 59.5B; 60.1B; 60.3C; 60.9C,D; 63.10B,C; 64.14A–C; 65.37A,B; 65.44C; 66.9B; 66.12; 67.10; 71.5B; 71.6B; 72.6A–D; 73.1B; 73.2D; 73.15C;76.3C; 77.2B; 77.17B; 77.24B; 77.28B; 77.43C,D; 77.48B,C; 78.6C; 78.14B; 78.24B; 79.4B; 79.8B; 79.9D,E; 79.10B; 79.15B; 79.17B; 79.19B</div><div class="para_indented" id="p0080">Elsevier and the <span class="italic">Gray’s Anatomy</span> 42nd edition editorial team would also like to offer sincere thanks to Mr Peter Helliwell (Head Biomedical Scientist, Department of Cellular Pathology, Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, Truro, UK) for contributing numerous high resolution photomicrographs of specially prepared histological sections of human tissues for the 40th, 41st and 42nd editions of Gray’s Anatomy, many prepared in collaboration with the late Dr Joseph Mathew.</div></section></body></html>
