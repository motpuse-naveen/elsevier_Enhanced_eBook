It occupies most of the right hypochondriac and epigastric regions and frequently extends into the left hypochondriac region as far as the left anterior axillary line (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 66.1</span></a>). As the body grows from infancy to adulthood, the liver rapidly increases in size. This period of growth reaches a plateau around 18 years and is followed by a gradual decrease in liver weight from middle age. The ratio of liver to body weight decreases with growth from infancy to adulthood. The liver weight is 4–5% of body weight in infancy and decreases to approximately 2% in adulthood. The size of the liver also differs between the sexes (being smaller in females) and body size (enlarging with fat deposition in obese individuals). It has an overall wedge shape, in part determined by the form of the upper abdominal cavity into which it grows. The narrow end of the wedge lies towards the left hypochondriac region and the anterior edge points anteriorly and inferiorly. The superior and right lateral aspects are shaped by the anterolateral abdominal and thoracic walls, and by the respiratory diaphragm. The inferior aspect is shaped by the adjacent viscera. The fibrous capsule of the capsule is no longer considered important in maintaining the shape of the liver; it allows expansion when the liver hypertrophies in response to disease, surgical resection or contralateral embolization of the hepatic portal vein or hepatic artery.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000665/main.assets/f66-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 66.1</span> The ‘bed’ of the liver.

It assumes a more yellowish tinge with increasing fat (steatosis) and the edges become more rounded. These changes occur commonly in individuals who are obese and/or drink an excessive amount of alcohol. The liver gains a bluish tinge with venous outflow obstruction (Budd–Chiari syndrome) or congestive heart failure. The texture of the organ is usually soft to firm, though this depends partly on the volume of blood it contains and on its content of adipose and fibrous connective tissues.</div><div class="text" id="p0020">The liver performs a wide range of metabolic activities required for homeostasis, nutrition and immune defence. For example, it is important for the removal and breakdown of toxic or potentially toxic materials from the blood; the regulation of blood glucose and lipids; the storage of certain vitamins, iron and other micronutrients; the synthesis of proteins and clotting factors; the metabolism of amino acids; and bile production. It is involved in a plethora of other biochemical reactions. Since most of these processes are exothermic, a substantial part of the thermal energy production of the body, especially at rest, is provided by the liver. The liver is populated by phagocytic macrophages, components of the mononuclear phagocyte system capable of removing particulates from the blood stream. It is an important site of haemopoiesis in the fetus; extramedullary haemopoiesis in the setting of haematological disease.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">An account of the more common eponyms relating to the anatomy and surgery of the liver is provided in <a href="#bib57" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_57">Stringer (2009)</a>.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><section><a id="s0015"/><h2 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0020">Surfaces of the liver</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0030">The liver is usually described as having superior, anterior, right, posterior and inferior surfaces with a distinct inferior border (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Figs 66.2</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">66.3</span></a>). However, the superior, anterior and right surfaces are continuous and no definable borders separate them. It is more appropriate to group them as the diaphragmatic surface, which is mostly separated from the inferior, or visceral, surface by a narrow inferior border. At the infrasternal angle, the inferior border is adjacent to the anterior abdominal wall and accessible to physical examination by percussion, but not usually palpable except on deep inspiration. In the midline, the inferior border of the liver is near the transpyloric plane. In women and children the border often projects a little inferior to the right costal arch (margin).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000665/main.assets/f66-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 66.2</span> The surfaces and external features of the liver. <span class="bold">A</span>, Superior view. <span class="bold">B</span>, Posterior view. <span class="bold">C</span>, Anterior view. <span class="bold">D</span>, Inferior view.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0020"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000665/main.assets/f66-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0020"/><a id="fspara0020"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 66.3</span> Relations of the liver. <span class="bold">A</span>, Superior view. <span class="bold">B</span>, Posterior view. <span class="bold">C</span>, Anterior view. <span class="bold">D</span>, Inferior view.</figcaption></figure></div><section><a id="s0020"/><section><a id="s0025"/><section><a id="s0030"/><section><a id="s0035"/><section><a id="s0040"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0025">Superior surface</p><div class="textfl" id="p0035">The superior surface is the largest and lies immediately below the respiratory diaphragm, separated from it by peritoneum, except for a small triangular area where the two layers of the falciform ligament diverge.

A three-tier classification of supporting structures has been proposed: the suspensory attachments of the inferior vena cava, hepatic veins, and coronary and triangular ligaments to the posterior abdominal wall (primary factors); the support provided by the right kidney, right colic flexure and duodenopancreatic complex (secondary factors); and the attachment of the falciform ligament to the anterior abdominal wall and respiratory diaphragm (tertiary factors) (<a href="#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_21">Flament et al 1982</a>). The surgical implications of these different factors are important for understanding the pathophysiology of blunt liver trauma and the stability of transplanted liver grafts. The inferior vena cava and the hepatic veins, especially the right hepatic vein, appear to be the most important anatomical structures supporting the bulk of the liver. Other factors that influence the position of the liver within the abdominal cavity include positive intra-abdominal pressure and the movement of the diaphragm during respiration.</div></section><section><a id="s0075"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0055">Gross anatomical lobes</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0080">Historically, the liver has been divided on the basis of its external appearance into right, left, caudate and quadrate lobes, defined in part by peritoneal ligamentous attachments.

It is often divided in upper abdominal surgery to optimize access to the upper abdominal viscera or as the first step in mobilizing the liver.

Here, the liver is attached to the diaphragm by loose connective tissue that is continuous inferiorly with the ‘anterior pararenal space’. On the right, the two layers of the coronary ligament converge laterally to form the right triangular ligament. On the left, the two layers become closely applied and form the left triangular ligament. The superior layer of the coronary ligament is reflected superiorly onto the inferior surface of the respiratory diaphragm and inferiorly onto the right and superior surfaces of the liver. The inferior layer of the coronary ligament is reflected inferiorly over the right suprarenal gland and right kidney and superiorly onto the inferior surface of the liver.

The left triangular ligament lies in front of the abdominal part of the oesophagus and part of the fundus of the stomach: its division allows the left lobe of the liver to be mobilized for exposure of the abdominal part of the oesophagus and crura of the respiratory diaphragm. However, the left triangular ligament is also an important stabilizing factor for the left lobe after excision of the right lobe of the liver: its division destabilizes the left lobe so that it can rotate and displace into the space created under the right half of the diaphragm, compromising the venous outflow of the left lobe and/or portal venous inflow to the left lobe, with consequent liver dysfunction.

The common hepatic artery (<a href="#f0085"><span class="bold">Fig. 66.9</span></a>) gives off the right gastric and gastroduodenal arteries (<a href="#f0085"><span class="bold">Fig. 66.9A</span></a>). After originating from the coeliac trunk, it passes anteriorly and laterally, above the superior border of the pancreas, to the superior aspect of the first part of the duodenum. It is subdivided into the common hepatic artery, from the coeliac trunk to the origin of the gastroduodenal artery, and the proper hepatic artery, from that point to its bifurcation. Both parts ascend anterior to the hepatic portal vein and medial to the bile duct within the free margin of the hepatoduodenal ligament in the anterior wall of the omental foramen. The left and right hepatic arteries arise at a variable level <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1212" id="pagebreak_1212"/>below the porta hepatis. The right hepatic artery typically crosses posterior (occasionally anterior) to the common hepatic duct (<a href="#f0085"><span class="bold">Fig. 66.9B</span></a>). Its usual course is toward the common hepatic duct: it bends inferiorly before crossing posterior to the duct and then bends back up toward the right hepatic duct lateral to the common hepatic duct and hepatic portal vein. Its close proximity to the bifurcation of the bile duct means that it is often involved or encased by bile duct cancers that arise at the bifurcation (hilar cholangiocarcinoma). The right hepatic artery is more frequently involved than the left hepatic artery in bile duct cancers of the porta hepatis. Occasionally, the right hepatic artery crosses anterior to the common hepatic duct and is more vulnerable to injury during biliary surgery. It almost always divides into an anterior branch supplying segments V and VIII and a posterior branch supplying segments VI and VII. The anterior division also often supplies a branch to segment I and the gallbladder. The proper hepatic artery sometimes divides at a more proximal level close to its origin; occasionally it divides distally, well to the left of the porta hepatis. The main significance of a proximal division is that the right hepatic artery can pass posterior to the hepatic portal vein (<a href="#bib32" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_32">Launois and Jamieson 1993</a>).

In such cases, the variant artery runs in the lesser omentum posterior to the hepatic portal vein and bile duct and can usually be identified at surgery by palpable pulsation posterior to the hepatic portal vein. An accessory right hepatic artery can be injured during resection of the pancreatic head because it lies close to the hepatic portal vein. Occasionally, a replaced or accessory left hepatic artery arises from the left gastric artery, entering the liver through the umbilical fissure; this artery provides a source of collateral supply in cases where the arteries at the porta hepatis are occluded, but it can also be injured during mobilization of the stomach as it lies in the superior portion of the lesser omentum. Rarely, an accessory left or right hepatic artery arises from the gastroduodenal artery or directly from the aorta. The presence of replaced arteries can be life-saving in patients with bile duct cancer; because they are further away from the bile duct they tend to be spared from infiltration by the cancer, making excision of the tumour feasible.

Each canal collects bile from multiple canaliculi and empties into a bile ductule (lined by cholangiocytes) that drains into an interlobular bile duct within the portal tracts (<a href="#bib48" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_48">Roskams et al 2004</a>, <a href="#bib50" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_50">Saxena and Theise 2004</a>). The flow of bile is thus towards the periphery of the lobule, in the opposite direction to the centripetal blood flow.</div></section><section><a id="s0480"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0315">Cells of the liver</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0455">Resident cells of the liver include hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells (perisinusoidal cells; fat-storing cells; cells of Ito), sinusoidal endothelial cells, stellate macrophages (Kupffer cells), the epithelial cells of the biliary tree (cholangiocytes), hepatic stem cells, hepatic natural killer lymphocytes (pit cells) and connective tissue cells of the capsule and portal tracts (see <a href="#f0070">Fig. 66.16B</a>).</div><section><a id="s0485"/><section><a id="s0490"/><section><a id="s0495"/><section><a id="s0500"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0320">Hepatocytes</p><div class="textfl" id="p0460">About 80% of the volume of the liver and 60% of its cellular population is made up of hepatocytes (parenchymal cells) (see <a href="#f0075">Fig. 66.18</a>).

The nuclei are round, euchromatic and often tetraploid, polyploid or multiple, with two or more in each cell. The cytoplasm typically contains a considerable amount of rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, many mitochondria, lysosomes and well-developed Golgi apparatus, all features indicating high metabolic activity. Glycogen granules and lipid vacuoles are usually prominent. Numerous large peroxisomes and vacuoles containing enzymes, e.g. urease in distinctive crystalline forms, indicate the complex metabolism of these cells. Their role in iron metabolism is reflected by the presence of storage vacuoles containing crystals of ferritin and haemosiderin.</div><div class="text" id="p0465">The cell surface facing the sinusoids exhibits numerous microvilli, approximately 0.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm long, creating a large surface area (approximately <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1216" id="pagebreak_1216"/><a id="pg1216"/>70% of the hepatocyte surface) exposed to blood plasma. Elsewhere, hepatocytes are linked by numerous gap junctions and desmosomes. The lateral plasma membranes of adjacent hepatocytes form microscopic channels, bile canaliculi, which are specialized regions of intercellular space formed by apposing grooves in the membranes and sealed from extraneous interstitial space by tight junctions. Four types of transmembrane molecules (occludins, claudins, junctional adhesion molecules and Coxsackie virus and adenovirus receptors) constitute the core units of the functional protein complexes of the tight junctions (<a href="#bib33" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_33">Lee 2012</a>) (see <a href="../B978070207705000001X/B978070207705000001X.xhtml#f0140">Fig. 1.27</a>). Individual tight junction complexes, either alone or in combination, are involved in signalling pathways in health and disease. Numerous membrane-bound exocytotic vesicles cluster near the lumina of the canaliculi because the secretion of bile is targeted at the canalicular plasma membrane. The tight junctions surrounding the biliary canaliculi prevent bile from entering the interstitial fluid or blood plasma, thereby creating a blood–bile barrier.</div></section><section><a id="s0505"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0325">Hepatic stellate cells</p><div class="textfl" id="p0470">Hepatic stellate cells are much less numerous than hepatocytes. They lie within the perisinusoidal space between the sinusoids and the hepatocyte plates. Irregular in outline, they are characterized by numerous cytoplasmic lipid droplets in which the fat-soluble vitamin A is stored. They secrete most of the intralobular matrix components, including collagen type III (reticular) fibres and are a significant source of growth factors involved in liver homeostasis and regeneration. They play a major role in pathological processes (<a href="#bib65" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_65">Yin et al 2013</a>). In response to liver injury hepatic stellate cells become activated and predominantly myofibroblast-like. They are responsible for the replacement of damaged hepatocytes with collagenous scar tissue, hepatic fibrosis, seen initially in zone 3 around central veins. Fibrosis can progress to cirrhosis, where the parenchymal architecture and pattern of blood flow within the liver are both destroyed, with major systemic consequences.</div></section><section><a id="s0510"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0330">Sinusoidal endothelial cells</p><div class="textfl" id="p0475">Hepatic venous sinusoids are generally wider than blood capillaries and are lined by a thin but highly fenestrated endothelium that lacks a complete basal lamina.

They form the largest population of the mononuclear phagocyte system responsible for removing cellular and microbial debris from the circulation and for secreting cytokines involved in defence: they have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various hepatic diseases, including endotoxin tolerance, liver transplantation, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and alcoholic liver disease (<a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Li et al 2017</a>).
