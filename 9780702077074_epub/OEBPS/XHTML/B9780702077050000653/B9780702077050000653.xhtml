It begins as the caecum and vermiform appendix, which are usually located in the right iliac fossa. The ascending colon passes superiorly in the right lateral region to the right hypochondriac region, where it bends to the left to form the right colic flexure and become the transverse colon. This loops across the abdomen with an anteroinferior convexity until it reaches the left hypochondriac region, where it curves inferiorly to form the left colic flexure (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 65.2</span></a>). From there, it descends in the left lateral region as the descending colon before continuing as the sigmoid colon in the left iliac region. The sigmoid colon descends into the lesser pelvis and becomes the rectum anterior to the third sacral vertebra. The rectum transitions to the anal canal at the level of the pelvic diaphragm. Embryologically, the large intestine is formed from the distal midgut, all of the hindgut and the anal pit (proctodeum) (<a href="../B9780702077050000227/B9780702077050000227.xhtml">Ch. 22</a> and <a href="../B9780702077050000227/B9780702077050000227.xhtml#f0025">Figs 22.4</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000227/B9780702077050000227.xhtml#f0040">22.7E</a>). Knowledge of the development of the large intestine not only helps to explain its anatomy, relations (including peritoneal attachments) and neurovascular supply, but is also fundamental to understanding congenital large intestine disorders such as anorectal malformations and malrotation of the gut.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000653/main.assets/f65-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 65.1</span> An overview of the colon and its relations.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000653/main.assets/f65-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 65.2</span> The appearance of the colon on double contrast barium enema examination, demonstrating the transverse colon and left and right colic flexures.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0015">In the adult, the large intestine is approximately 1–1.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>m long <span class="italic">in vivo</span>, although there is considerable individual variation. It differs from the small intestine in several ways: it has a greater calibre; for much of its course it is more fixed in position; the outer longitudinal muscle layer of the colon is concentrated into three longitudinal bands, taeniae coli; small fatty projections, omental appendices, are scattered over its free surface (although these tend to be absent from the caecum, appendix and rectum); and the colonic wall is puckered into haustra, visible on plain radiographs as incomplete septations arising from the wall of the intestine (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 65.3</span></a>; see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 65.2</a>).

However, after rotation of the gut <span class="italic">in utero</span>, large portions of it come to lie adherent to the retroperitoneum, while other segments remain suspended by a mesentery within the abdominal cavity, i.e. an intermesenteric position. The mesenteries of the colon consist of two layers of visceral peritoneum enclosing adipose and connective tissues and surrounding vessels, nerves and lymphatics that run forward from retroperitoneal structures. The caecum may be firmly adherent to the retroperitoneum but is frequently suspended by a short mesentery, especially in infants. The ascending colon is usually adherent to the retroperitoneum, while the transverse colon is suspended by a mesocolon and is freely mobile within the upper abdomen. The left and right colic flexures may have a short mesentery. The descending colon is adherent to the retroperitoneum, usually down to the level of the iliac crest, and the sigmoid colon has a mesentery of variable length. The sigmoid mesentery shortens as it approaches the pelvis and practically disappears at the level of the rectosigmoid junction. The proximal third of the rectum is covered by peritoneum on its anterior and lateral aspects, and the middle third by peritoneum on its anterior aspect only; the distal third is below the peritoneum.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">The microstructure of the large intestine corresponds to the general pattern of the gut wall, comprising a mucous membrane consisting of epithelium, lamina propria and muscularis mucosae, surrounded by inner circular and outer longitudinal layers of smooth muscle and a serosa (see <a href="#f0020">Figs 65.3</a>, <a href="#f0175">65.50</a>, <a href="#f0180">65.51</a>). The mucosa also contains scattered neuroendocrine cells derived from the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) cell lineage; these cells produce amines and/or peptides, which act as hormones or neurotransmitters. Unlike the small intestine, the mucosa of the large intestine lacks villi, and the intestinal glands contain a high proportion of goblet (mucin-secreting) cells. In the appendix, the intestinal glands are sparse and numerous lymphoid follicles are found in the mucosa and submucosa. Although it is not a vital organ, the primary function of the colon is transmission and elimination of intestinal contents, but it also has important absorptive and secretory roles. The large intestine has its own intrinsic (enteric) nerve supply, the activity of which is modulated by extrinsic innervation.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><section><a id="s0015"/><h2 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0020">External appearance</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0030">The haustra of the colon are frequently absent in the caecum and often relatively sparse in the ascending and proximal transverse colon. They become more pronounced beyond the middle of the transverse colon. The sigmoid colon often has marked haustra. Omental appendices are small, fat-filled pouches of peritoneum that project from the external surface of the colon and are supplied by blood vessels that perforate its wall. There are few, if any, omental appendices on the serosal surface of the caecum, and only a limited number scattered along the ascending colon. They are more common over the distal colon and particularly numerous on the surface of the sigmoid colon, where they can be large in the obese individual. The rectum has no omental appendices.</div><div class="text" id="p0035">The three taeniae coli are located in fairly constant positions beneath the serosa of the colon, except in the transverse colon. They are found on the antimesenteric aspect of the colon directly opposite the mesentery (free taenia), posterolaterally (omental taenia) and posteromedially (mesocolic taenia) midway between the free taenia and the mesentery (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 65.3</a>). In the ascending and descending colon, the omental taeniae are often hidden by the peritoneal reflection on to the colonic wall. In the transverse colon, the taeniae are rotated as a consequence of the dependent position of this segment of colon, so anterior becomes inferior, posteromedial becomes posterior, and posterolateral becomes superior. The width of the taeniae coli remains fairly constant throughout the colon but they broaden out in the distal part of the sigmoid colon and gradually merge to form a complete longitudinal muscle layer around the rectum, which therefore has no external haustra.</div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0025">Internal appearance</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0040">The haustra of the colon represent sites where the mucosa and submucosa of the colonic wall are infolded; these folds partially span the lumen of the colon but never form a complete circumferential ring. The pattern of haustra and appearance of the colonic mucosa help the clinician appreciate the level reached during flexible endoscopic examinations of the colon (<a href="#bib76" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_76">Silverstein and Tytgat 1991</a>). In the caecum, the three taeniae coli converge to form a characteristic ‘trefoil’ pattern on the caecal wall (<a href="#f0185"><span class="bold">Fig. 65.4</span></a>). The distal caecum is usually devoid of haustra, although a spiral mucosal pattern is often seen in the region of the orifice of the appendix (<a href="#f0190"><span class="bold">Fig. 65.5</span></a>). The ileal orifice can be identified as a thickened fold (<a href="#f0195"><span class="bold">Fig. 65.6</span></a>) and can be cannulated endoscopically to examine the terminal ileum. In the distal caecum and ascending colon, the haustra can extend across one-third of the lumen. In the transverse colon, the haustra often confer a triangular appearance to the cross-section of the lumen when it is viewed along its axis at colonoscopy (<a href="#f0200"><span class="bold">Fig. 65.7</span></a>). The haustra of the descending and sigmoid colon tend to be thicker and shorter, producing a more circular lumen cross-section (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Figs 65.8</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0030"><span class="bold">65.9</span></a>) . The wall of the colon is thinnest in the region of the caecum and ascending colon, where it is at risk of perforation during therapeutic endoscopic procedures. The overall luminal diameter is often smallest in the descending colon. The tortuosity of the sigmoid colon means that shorter lengths of it are visible during endoscopy than elsewhere in the colon. The haustra of the rectum usually form consistent and recognizable transverse rectal folds (spiral valves of Houston) and the submucosal vessels tend to be more pronounced than in the colon (<a href="#f0035"><span class="bold">Fig. 65.10</span></a>) . Most patients are found to have two or three folds and these are useful landmarks for planning rectal surgery (<a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_1">Abramson 1978</a>). Distinct veins are usually visible during endoscopy, and are most marked above the anorectal junction.</div><div id="p0045"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0185"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000653/main.assets/on65-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0185"/><a id="fspara0185"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 65.4</span> The endoscopic appearance of the caecum.

The most susceptible part of the chain of anastomosing vessels is at the junction of midgut- and hindgut-derived intestine in the distal transverse colon near the left colic flexure. However, the arterial supply to this region may be augmented by an inner arterial arc (of Riolan), which runs a meandering course in the colonic mesentery between the main trunk of the middle colic artery and the ascending branch of the left colic artery (<a href="#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Fisher and Fry 1987</a>, <a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_31">Gourley and Gering 2005</a>).

The latter may occur, for example, in association with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, when the descending colon remains viable because the marginal artery continues to receive an adequate blood supply from left branches of the middle colic artery and the sigmoid colon gains its blood supply from the middle anorectal and inferior anorectal arteries. When colonic ischaemia does occur, it is usually maximal in the region of the left colic flexure and proximal descending colon because this segment is farthest from the collateral arterial supplies. Occlusion of the common iliac arteries can also result in dilation of the marginal and inferior mesenteric arteries, which become an important collateral supply to the lower limbs via dilated middle anorectal arteries commonly arising from either the internal pudendal or inferior gluteal artery (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Bilhim et al 2013</a>).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0050"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0050">Veins</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0085">The venous drainage of the large intestine is primarily into the hepatic portal vein via the superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric veins, although some drainage from the rectum occurs via middle anorectal veins into the internal iliac veins, and inferior anorectal veins into the internal pudendal veins.

A fold of peritoneum runs between the terminal ileum and the anterior layer of the meso-appendix (the ‘bloodless fold of Treves’), and another fold of peritoneum containing the anterior caecal vessels extends from the terminal ileal mesentery to the anterior wall of the caecum (and contains the anterior caecal artery). The luminal orifice is sometimes partially covered by a mucosal fold forming an asymmetric ‘valve’ (see <a href="#f0190">Fig. 65.5</a>).

This can lead to suppuration, infarction and necrosis. Appendicoliths are more common in children than adults but their prevalence is variable, reflecting differences among populations, definitions and methods of detection.

It is not until parietal peritoneum adjacent to the appendix becomes involved in the inflammatory process that somatic nociceptors are stimulated, resulting in localization of pain to the right iliac fossa. Removal of the appendix is not in itself associated with any discernible long-term sequelae but this does not mean it is an entirely vestigial organ.

The marginal artery thus formed lies a few centimetres from the mesenteric edge of the transverse colon. Sometimes, the middle colic artery divides into three or more branches within the transverse mesocolon, in which case the most lateral branches form the arterial anastomoses. An accessory, or rarely a replaced, middle colic artery can arise directly from the abdominal aorta (<a href="#bib90" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_90">Yoshida et al 1993</a>), dorsal pancreatic, hepatic, inferior mesenteric or left colic arteries (<a href="#f0110"><span class="bold">Fig. 65.25</span></a>).

These tributaries drain into the superior mesenteric vein, which ascends to the right of the artery, crossing the horizontal part of the duodenum and uncinate process of the pancreas. Behind the neck of the pancreas, at the level of the transpyloric plane (the inferior border of the body of the first lumbar vertebra), it joins the splenic vein to form the hepatic portal vein, which ascends behind the superior part of the duodenum to reach the liver. The right colic vein is highly variable: it can drain either directly into the superior mesenteric vein, or into the right gastro-omental or inferior pancreaticoduodenal veins to form a ‘gastrocolic trunk’ that drains into the superior mesenteric vein, or it can be entirely absent (<a href="#bib89" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_89">Yamaguchi et al 2002</a>, <a href="#bib80" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_80">Stefura et al 2018</a>). Several tributaries draining into one or more middle colic veins are highly variable in extent and position. The middle colic veins drain either into the superior mesenteric vein, just before its junction with the splenic vein, or directly into the hepatic portal vein. The appendicular vein usually joins the caecal vein to become the ileocolic vein; infection from the appendix can therefore be carried directly to the liver via the hepatic portal vein.</div></section><section><a id="s0155"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0150">Lymphatic drainage</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0215">Lymphatic vessels originate from both anterior and posterior aspects of the colon. Lymph drainage from midgut derivatives follows the course of the superior mesenteric artery. Thus, lymph from the caecum and appendix drains to nodes associated with the ileocolic artery, and lymph from the distal ascending colon and right colic flexure drains to nodes along the right colic artery (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 65.16</a>). When the distal transverse colon and left colic flexure are predominantly supplied by the middle colic artery, lymph drainage of this segment is also largely to superior mesenteric nodes. Lymphatic vessels in the appendix are numerous and combine to form vessels that ascend in the meso-appendix, occasionally interrupted by one or more nodes. They unite to form three or four larger vessels that anastomose with lymphatic vessels draining the ascending colon into ileocolic nodes.</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0210"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0155">Hindgut-Derived Region of Large Intestine</h2><section><a id="s0165"/><section><a id="s0170"/><h3 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0160">Left colic flexure</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0220">The left colic flexure marks the junction between the transverse and descending colons and lies in the left hypochondriac region, anterior to the tail of the pancreas and the left kidney (<a href="#f0115"><span class="bold">Fig. 65.26</span></a>).

The peritoneum is reflected anteriorly on to the urinary bladder in males to form the rectovesical pouch, or on to the posterior part of the vaginal fornix in females to form the recto-uterine pouch (of Douglas). The level of this reflection is more superior in males. In male neonates, the peritoneum extends on the anterior rectal wall as far as the inferior limit of the prostate.

Two types of transverse rectal folds have been recognized. One consists of the mucosa, the circular muscle layer and part of the longitudinal muscle, and is marked externally by an indentation. The other is devoid of longitudinal muscle and has no external marking. When three transverse rectal folds are found, the most superior fold at the beginning of the rectum can be on either the left or the right and it occasionally encircles the rectal lumen. The middle fold is largest and most constant and lies immediately superior to the rectal ampulla, projecting from the anterior and right wall just below the level of the anterior peritoneal reflection; the circular muscle is particularly prominent in this fold. The inferior fold is on the left and is the most variable.

The number and calibre of the middle anorectal vessels are highly variable; they can be very small or even absent (<a href="#bib66" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_66">Sato and Sato 1991</a>). The ‘lateral ligaments’ are not clearly seen on MRI or CT, and only appear as an identifiable structure with surgical traction on the rectum. The fascia of the ‘ligaments’ is flimsy and probably contributes little to support of the rectum. Parietal fascia covers levator ani and the muscles of the side wall of the pelvis, and is continuous posteriorly with the presacral fascia.</div><section><a id="s9060"/><section><a id="s9065"/><section><a id="s9070"/><section><a id="s9075"/><section><a id="s0255"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0205">Rectal prolapse</p><div class="textfl" id="p0350">In prolapse of the rectum involving all layers of the rectal wall, the mid and proximal rectum descend towards the pelvic diaphragm on straining. Descent occurs within the lumen of the rectum as a form of intussusception, and could be a consequence of the large diameter of the rectal ampulla and relative fixation of the anal canal. The loose adipose tissue of the upper mesorectum and the ‘lateral ligaments’ offer only limited resistance against rectal descent. It is common for the region around the anus and rectum bound by levator ani to be chronically enlarged in patients suffering from recurrent rectal prolapse, but this is probably a consequence rather than a cause of the prolapse.

The inferior hypogastric plexus is closely related to the plane of dissection laterally; these nerves must be preserved to retain urinary bladder and sexual function.

Motor neurones can be inhibitory or excitatory. Intrinsic sensory neurones are activated by mechanical stimuli such as stretch and muscle tension, and by chemical stimuli released by neuroendocrine cells in the wall of the gut (see <a href="../B9780702077050000033/B9780702077050000033.xhtml#f0145">Fig. 3.28</a>).

Colonic motor activity is greatest during the day and increases on waking and after meals. It is characterized by sustained tonic contractions and brief phasic contractions. Phasic contractions are subdivided according to whether or not they propagate along the colon. Non-propagating contractions are associated with segmental mixing of luminal contents, whereas propagated sequences can be retrograde or antegrade. In the normal colon, antegrade activity is more frequent than retrograde sequences, which are seen more in the proximal colon. High-amplitude propagated contractions occur in adults 4–6 times per day, originate anywhere in the colon (but mostly proximally), and migrate for a variable distance distally (<a href="#bib55" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_55">Narducci et al 1987</a>, <a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Bharucha 2012</a>).

Rectal motor activity is characterized by motor complexes that can be triggered by propagating contractions from the proximal colon and by the delivery of faeces or flatus from the sigmoid colon.

Such penetrating fibres have been termed corrugator cutis ani.</div><div class="text" id="p0485"><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0255"><!--<img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000653/main.assets/f65-32-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/>--><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0255"/><a id="fspara0260"/><!--<span class="fignum">Fig. 65.44</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, A coronal section through the anal canal; glandular and vascular structures are shown unilaterally for clarity. <span class="bold">B</span>, A sagittal section through the anal canal; the anal canal is angled posteriorly and so anterior sphincteric structures appear to be lower than posterior structures.

These are better defined in children than in adults.

Dilated submucosal veins in the proximal anal canal form an internal rectal plexus. Tiny arteriovenous connections to these dilated submucosal veins give the blood within them a higher oxygen tension and therefore a redder colour than normal venous blood. The submucosal vessels are most prominent in the left-lateral, right-posterior and right-anterior quadrants of the wall of the canal (approximately 3, 7 and 9 o’clock when viewed in the lithotomy position); here, the subepithelial tissues are expanded into three ‘anal cushions’. Although variable in number and position, these help to seal the anal canal and contribute to the maintenance of continence to flatus and fluid. The anal cushions are important in the pathogenesis of haemorrhoids. The distal ends of the columns form small crescentic folds, called anal valves, between which lie small recesses known as anal sinuses. The anal valves and sinuses together form the scalloped pectinate line, which is firmly anchored to submucosal connective tissue. Anal glands open into small depressions, anal crypts (sinuses), in the anal valves. The glands are branched and lined by stratified columnar epithelium. Cystic dilations in the intestinal glands can extend through the internal anal sphincter and even into the external anal sphincter (<a href="#bib72" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_72">Seow-Choen and Ho 1994</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0520">The epithelium below the pectinate line is smooth and typically shows an abrupt transition to parchment-coloured, non-keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium, which lacks sweat and sebaceous glands and hair follicles but contains numerous somatic sensory nerve endings conveying sensations of touch, pain and temperature (<a href="#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_21">Duthie and Gairns 1960</a>). It extends down to the intersphincteric groove, a palpable depression at the distal border of the internal anal sphincter. Distal to the intersphincteric groove, the anal canal is lined by hair-bearing, keratinizing, stratified squamous epithelium, which is continuous with the perianal skin. Dilated veins in the subepithelial tissue below the pectinate line contribute to an external rectal plexus (see <a href="#f0255">Fig. 65.44</a>); this can be seen on clinical examination as a circumferential ring at the anal orifice if the subject is asked to bear down.</div><div class="text" id="p0525">The junction between the columnar epithelium above and the squamous epithelium below is referred to as the anal pecten.

Transient relaxation of the upper internal anal sphincter occurs in response to rectal distension (the recto-anal inhibitory reflex) and postprandial rectal contractions (the sampling reflex). Relaxation allows the distal rectal contents to pass into the proximal anal canal, enabling their physical nature to be consciously or subconsciously perceived; this is accompanied by sustained contraction of the distal internal anal sphincter and contraction of the external anal sphincter to maintain continence. The recto-anal inhibitory reflex is primarily mediated by the enteric nervous system, although spinal pathways could modulate it.

Stimulation of cholinergic muscarinic receptors (parasympathetic) causes internal anal sphincter relaxation and longitudinal anal muscle contraction, while α-adrenergic receptor stimulation (sympathetic) causes both the internal anal sphincter and longitudinal muscle to contract. Activation of nitrergic nerves also mediates internal anal sphincter relaxation and is the rationale for using topical nitroglycerine and other drugs that promote nitric oxide for treating pathological conditions associated with increased resting anal tone.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0405"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0325">Conjoint longitudinal muscle</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0565">The conjoint longitudinal muscle of the anal canal is a direct continuation of the outer longitudinal smooth muscle of the rectum, descending between the internal and external anal sphincters, and augmented in its proximal part by striated muscle fibres from the medial aspect of levator ani (<a href="#bib50" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_50">Lunniss and Phillips 1992</a>). It is particularly prominent in the fetus, where it is actually thicker than the internal anal sphincter. With advancing age, there is gradual replacement of muscle by connective tissue, so the layer becomes thin in the elderly and few muscle fibres are seen in its distal part. As it passes down the anal canal, muscle fibres peel off in three directions: internally, through the internal anal sphincter to reach the anal submucosa; inferiorly, through the striated muscle of the distal and subcutaneous part of the external anal sphincter to insert into the perianal skin (some of these fibres, e.g. corrugator cutis ani encircling the anal orifice); and outwards, through the upper part of the external anal sphincter (see <a href="#f0255">Fig. 65.44</a>). The most inferior fibres create a honeycomb arrangement in the subcutaneous fat and separate a superficial perianal space from the deeper ischio-anal fossa.

It is influenced by multiple factors including colonic transit, stool volume and consistency, posture, age, sex, psychology and behaviour, culture and lifestyle (<a href="#bib57" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_57">Palit et al 2012</a>). Social behaviour entrains defecation to occur at a time of convenience rather than simply in response to a defecatory urge. The urge to defecate is preceded by high-amplitude propagated contractions in the colon, which result in the antegrade propulsion of intraluminal contents to the rectum; these contractions increase in frequency and intensity just before expulsion. The response to rectal filling involves intact afferent fibres travelling from the rectum, reflex rectal contractions and normal rectal wall biomechanics. The rectum acts as a reservoir and is able to relax to accommodate faecal material and flatus (adaptive relaxation). Periodic sampling within the proximal anal canal helps to determine the nature of the rectal content. If the defecatory urge is inconvenient, pubo-analis and the external anal sphincter, which are tonically contracted at rest, can be further contracted voluntarily to move stool back up from the distal rectum. If the defecatory urge is associated with a conscious decision to evacuate, distal progression of colonic high-amplitude propagating complexes, rectal contractions, raised intra-abdominal pressure from voluntary straining (the efficiency of which is influenced by posture) and relaxation of pubo-analis (which straightens the anorectal flexure) and the anal sphincters all combine to enable defecation. Relaxation of the internal anal sphincter is a reflex response to rectal distension, whereas relaxation of the external anal sphincter is voluntary. During defecation, contraction of the conjoint longitudinal muscle shortens and opens the anal canal and flattens the anal cushions. Rectal contents and a variable quantity of colonic contents are evacuated. After defecation, the external anal sphincter contracts (the closing reflex), the internal anal sphincter gradually recovers its resting tone and the postural reflex is reactivated. The conjoint longitudinal muscle relaxes, permitting the anal canal to elongate and the anal cushions to re-expand.</div><div class="text" id="p0625">Problems with defecation can result from impaired colonic transit or from various functional or mechanical rectal disorders (<a href="#bib49" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_49">Lunniss et al 2009</a>). Functional causes include inadequate or ineffective expulsive effort, paradoxical contraction of the pelvic diaphragm and external anal sphincter (dyssynergia) and lack of normal sensation (rectal hyposensitivity). Mechanical causes include impedance to evacuation when straining (rectal intussusception, obstructing masses or anal stenosis), misdirection of force vectors during straining (rectocele), or dissipation of evacuatory forces (ballooning perineum).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0460"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0375">Anal continence and incontinence</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0630">As long as anal pressure exceeds rectal pressure, faecal continence will be maintained. Anal resting tone is derived mainly from sympathetically mediated tonic contraction of the internal anal sphincter, augmented by contraction of the external anal sphincter. Anal continence involves central, spinal and peripheral pathways, somatic, autonomic and enteric nerves, intact sacral sensorimotor reflexes, and structurally and functionally intact smooth and striated musculature.</div><div class="text" id="p0635">Sphincteric causes of faecal incontinence can be structural (disruption or atrophy of part of the sphincter musculature) or neuropathic (injury to the nerve supply to the sphincters), or a combination of both. The most common causes of sphincter disruption are obstetric injury, <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1203" id="pagebreak_1203"/>anal surgery (for haemorrhoids, fistulae or fissures) and trauma. Pudendal neuropathy is most commonly associated with childbirth (prolonged second stage of labour) and chronic straining.</div><div class="text" id="p0640">Although the anus constitutes the final barrier to faecal incontinence, factors operating proximal to the anal sphincters, such as the rate at which the stool is delivered to the rectum, rectal sensation and compliance, and adaptive relaxation, are also essential for maintaining faecal continence. Even if the sphincter mechanisms are structurally and functionally intact, faecal incontinence can occur, e.g. in diarrhoeal states or conditions where there is loss of rectal reservoir function (<a href="#bib69" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_69">Scott and Lunniss 2007</a>). Conversely, chronic rectal distension with retained faeces can result in passive (overflow) leakage, e.g. because the recto-anal inhibitory reflex is persistently activated, producing a chronically relaxed internal anal sphincter, and/or rectal sensation is blunted, causing diminished conscious contraction of the external anal sphincter.</div></section><section><a id="s0475"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0380">Microstructure of the Large Intestine</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0645">The submucosal and muscularis layers of tissue in the large intestinal wall (<a href="#f0175"><span class="bold">Fig. 65.50</span></a>) resemble those in the small intestine, whereas the mucosal layer differs in that that villi and circular folds are absent and the intestinal glands are longer and predominantly mucus-secreting.

The latter are situated mainly at the bases of the glands and secrete basally into the lamina propria. In general, the glands lack Paneth cells, although some may be present in the caecum.
