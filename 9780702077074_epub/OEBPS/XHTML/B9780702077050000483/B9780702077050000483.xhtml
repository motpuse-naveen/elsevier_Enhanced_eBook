Anatomical and medical imaging based studies continue to refine and redefine the ability to locate key anatomical structures using palpable landmarks/structures and reference planes and lines. Up-to-date descriptions of surface anatomy guide readers in how to locate key anatomical structures via the skin using visualization and palpation.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">landmark; palpable; surface; topographical; visible</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The upper limb is, in mechanical terms, a series of powered, articulated segments which enable the hand to be positioned accurately in space so that it can sense and manipulate its surrounding environment. It is attached to the bony thorax at the sternoclavicular joint, and to the chest wall by a series of powerful flat muscles which stabilize the scapula, allowing it to act as a stable but mobile base on which the limb can function. An extensive range of movement is enabled by a number of factors. The glenohumeral joint is remarkably little constrained and the muscles that both stabilize and move it are powerful. Elbow flexion allows movements close to the trunk, such as eating and attention to personal hygiene, while extension achieves a wide arc of reach for daily activities. Pronation and supination markedly increase the functional capacity of the hand by rotating the forearm through nearly 180°.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">In the soft tissues, the deep fascial planes and the synovial sheaths permit the excursion of muscles and tendons against each other and their adjacent structures. Condensations of fascia around the neurovascular bundles segregate them and enhance gliding.</div><div class="text" id="p0020">The innervation of the upper limb is complex and rich. There is a particular concentration of specialized sensory organelles in the wrist and hand, not only in the skin but also in the deep afferent system from muscles, tendons and joints. The postganglionic sympathetic vasomotor and sudomotor nerves are especially dense in the palmar skin. The basis of stereognosis, the ability to recognize the qualities of objects and textures, is a combination of stimuli from skin, tendon, muscle and joints. Movement is vital; blindfolded patients cannot identify the nature of an object if it is simply placed on the finger, but recognize it immediately if allowed to create spatial and temporal patterns by feeling the object or material between moving fingers and thumb.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Bones and Joints</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0025">The bones of the upper limb include the scapula, clavicle, humerus, radius and ulna (connected by the interosseous membrane along most of their length), the eight bones forming the carpus, five metacarpals and fourteen phalanges (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Figs 48.1</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">48.2</span></a>).

The limb is directly attached to the axial skeleton by one bony articulation, the sternoclavicular joint. The glenohumeral joint is shallow and little constrained, whereas the acromioclavicular joint is a plane joint stabilized by strong ligaments. The range of movements provided by these joints and the muscles acting across them is enormous. Arthrodesis of the thoracoscapular joint for facioscapulohumeral dystrophy improves flexion and abduction of the glenohumeral joint, but protraction and retraction are lost. A correctly performed glenohumeral arthrodesis retains powerful adduction, protraction and retraction, but rotation and the limited elevation achieved is dependent on rotation of the scapula. The elbow includes a hinge between the humerus and ulna, and two pivot joints, between the humerus and radius, and between the proximal radius and ulna. This permits a range of about 150° of flexion and extension, and 180° of pronosupination in conjunction with the distal radio-ulnar joint. The wrist complex allows a range of flexion and extension of about 140°, supplemented by some 70° of adduction and abduction. The condylar metacarpophalangeal joint enables 120° of flexion and extension, about 40° of abduction and adduction, and some rotation. Pronation and supination are unique to the primate upper limb. The range of movement of the thumb ray, which rests on the ‘saddle’ carpometacarpal joint, the qualities of the long muscles and the thenar muscles acting on the ray and the skin of the web space, are unique to humans.</div></section><section><a id="s0015"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0025">Skin and Fascia</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0035">The skin over the front of the neck and posterior triangle is mobile and is sustained by the underlying platysma. Large flaps may be raised safely when platysma is included with the skin. The postaxial skin of the posterior aspect of the neck, shoulder, arm and forearm is thicker and hairy, whereas the glabrous preaxial skin on the anterior surface of the arm and forearm is thinner and more mobile. The situation is reversed in the hand, where the thick palmar skin is firmly secured by a fibrous skeleton to the palmar aponeurosis, whereas the dorsal skin is thinner and more mobile, especially across the joints. The characteristic furrows or creases at the elbow, wrist and interphalangeal joints represent places of anchorage of the deep fascia. The hairy skin of the axilla is especially mobile, permitting the extensive range of movement at the glenohumeral joint; it is rich in sweat glands and their sympathetic nerves. The dense sympathetic innervation in the axilla, the hand and forearm is important in temperature homeostasis. The consequences of scarring from burns or other injury, or badly placed incisions, are severe, and nowhere more so than after a deep burn of the axilla.</div><div class="text" id="p0040">The superficial fascia is generally thicker on the dorsal aspect of the neck, shoulder, arm and forearm. Measurement of its thickness in the arm provides a useful measure of obesity. It is an important gliding plane between the skin and the underlying deep fascia. Nerves and vessels are at risk of entrapment or even rupture where they perforate the deep fascia to ramify into the superficial fascia and skin.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">The deep fascia, intermuscular septa and the interosseous membrane between the radius and ulna define discrete compartments that enable gliding of segregated structures against one another. The medial and lateral intermuscular septa of the arm and the interosseous membrane also provide wide areas for the attachment of muscles. The various fascial compartments are relevant to the spread of infection and tumour, and are especially important in ischaemia (compartment syndrome).</div><div class="text" id="p0050">The prevertebral fascia (see <a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355.xhtml#f0025">Fig. 35.4A</a>) envelops the phrenic nerve, scalene muscles, cervical ventral rami, cervical sympathetic trunk, and subclavian and vertebral arteries. It projects below the clavicle as the axillary sheath, enveloping the divisions and cords of the brachial plexus with the axillary artery, and continues into the arm as the brachial sheath, surrounding the brachial artery with its venae comitantes, the median nerve and the proximal part of the radial and ulnar nerves. The great muscles of the shoulder and axilla, deltoid, pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi are covered by deep fascia that winds around their deep surfaces to blend with the deep fascia of the arm. This latter is drawn upwards by suspensory condensations of fascia to form the cone-shaped axillary space, an arrangement that is obvious to the reader who traces the anterior surface of pectoralis major with a finger, then follows it round and deep, before thrusting the finger upwards as far at least as the lateral part of the second rib.</div><div class="text" id="p0055">The deep fascia of the arm and forearm forms a sleeve that is attached to the medial and lateral intermuscular septa in the arm, to the periosteum of the medial and lateral epicondyles and olecranon at the elbow, and to the periosteum of the ulna and radius. Important condensations, such as the bicipital aponeurosis at the elbow, and the flexor and extensor retinacula at the wrist, are, in turn, subdivided by septa. Discrete compartments within the forearm separate the superficial muscles from the deep. The reader will note the relative mobility of the extensor muscles that traverse the elbow: brachioradialis and the radial extensor muscles of the wrist form the ‘mobile wad’ of Henry, overlying the deeper compartment containing the posterior interosseous nerve and vessels, supinator, the digital extensors, extensor carpi ulnaris and the long muscles acting on the thumb ray.</div><div class="text" id="p0060">Three compartments are found in the anterior aspect of the forearm. The deep flexor compartment contains the anterior interosseous nerve and vessels, flexor pollicis longus, flexor digitorum profundus and pronator quadratus. The superficial compartment contains the radial artery, pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus and flexor digitorum superficialis. The ulnar nerve and vessels pass in a separate sheath close to the ulna. The anterior deep fascia of the forearm continues into the hand as the palmar aponeurosis, from which a complex arrangement of septa forms the fibrous skeleton of the hand (see <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513.xhtml#f0055">Fig. 51.12A</a>). The range of excursion of the main nerves of the upper limb across fixed points such as the first rib, the distal humerus and the distal radius, is some 10–15<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm and is enabled by gliding between the adventitia and the epineurium. More movement occurs within the plane between the epineurium and perineurium, and also within the perineurium itself (<span class="icon1"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000483/main.assets/icon03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="icon"/></span> <a href="../B9780702077050000860/B9780702077050000860.xhtml#B9780702077050000860">Commentary 1.5</a>).</div><section><a id="s0025"/><section><a id="s1025"/><h3 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0030">Cutaneous innervation</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0065">Bundles of nerves enter the skin deep in the dermis and course towards the skin surface, giving off axons, nearly all unmyelinated, that innervate the associated end organs. The few myelinated axons terminate at hair follicles, Meissner corpuscles and Merkel complexes. The density of innervation of the epidermis is greatest in the proximal segment of the limb and there is little change between the twentieth and eightieth years.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0035">Muscles</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0070">The sensorimotor cortex controls movements, not individual muscles.

This system of complex and refined muscle patterning depends on the integrity of the somatic afferent and efferent pathways in the central nervous system.</div><div class="text" id="p0075">The muscles of the upper limb may be grouped according to their origin and the joints on which they act. Muscles arising from the axial skeleton to act on the scapula include trapezius, levator scapulae, the rhomboids and serratus anterior. Muscles arising from the axial skeleton to act on the glenohumeral joint include the sternal head of pectoralis major, pectoralis minor and latissimus dorsi. Muscles passing between the scapula and the proximal humerus control the glenohumeral joint. They include supra- and infraspinatus, subscapularis, teres major and minor, and coracobrachialis. Deltoid and the clavicular head of pectoralis major also belong here, even though they arise in part from the clavicle. The main muscles controlling the elbow include biceps brachii and triceps: the long heads of both muscles traverse the glenohumeral joint to insert on the scapula. The main muscles controlling supination and pronation are biceps brachii and supinator, pronator teres and pronator quadratus. The radiocarpal joint is controlled by extensors carpi radialis longus and brevis, extensor carpi ulnaris, flexors carpi ulnaris and radialis, and palmaris longus. The muscles acting on the thumb ray include the powerful flexor pollicis longus, the much weaker abductor pollicis longus, and extensors pollicis longus and brevis. These last three are essential for thumb function. The unopposed action of flexor pollicis longus leads to the virtually useless thumb in palm posture. The extension and flexion of the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the fingers rest on coordinated activity in extensor digitorum, flexors digitorum superficialis and profundus, and the interosseous and lumbrical muscles. Extensor digitorum alone extends the metacarpophalangeal joints; the long flexors alone flex the interphalangeal joints. The imbalance caused by paralysis of the small muscles leads to ‘clawing’ deformity (see <a href="#f0175">Fig. 48.27</a>). The small muscles of the hand may be considered as those controlling the thumb ray and web space; adductor pollicis lies deep to the first dorsal interosseous; abductor and flexor pollicis brevis and opponens pollicis are superficial and form the ball of the thumb. The interosseous muscles acting with the lumbricals flex, abduct and adduct the metacarpophalangeal joints and, in conjunction with the long flexor and extensor muscles, enable full extension of the proximal interphalangeal joints. Abductor and opponens digiti minimi and flexor digiti minimi brevis form the hypothenar eminence and act on the little finger.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">Many muscles act on more than one joint, for example, the long heads of biceps and triceps flex and extend, respectively the glenohumeral joint as well as the elbow. In addition, biceps brachii is a powerful supinator of the forearm. Extensor carpi radialis longus not only extends the wrist, but also is a powerful abductor of that joint and a flexor of the elbow in pronation. Flexor carpi ulnaris is the most powerful muscle in the forearm; it contributes to elbow flexion, flexes and adducts the wrist, and is active in all sustained movements of the wrist.</div><div class="text" id="p0085">Certain muscles are functionally segregated, e.g. the anterior part of deltoid is a powerful flexor of the glenohumeral joint, whereas the posterior part is the most powerful extensor of that joint.</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0040">Vascular Supply and Lymphatic Drainage</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0090">The detailed regional descriptions of these systems in the upper limb are found in <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495.xhtml#c0049">Chapters 49</a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513.xhtml#c0051">51</a>.</div><section><a id="s0040"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0045">Arteries</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0095">The axial vessel is the subclavian artery, which arises from the brachiocephalic trunk on the right and directly from the arch of the aorta on the left (<a href="#f0100"><span class="bold">Fig. 48.3</span></a>). The artery is described in three parts that are successively anteromedial, deep and lateral to scalenus anterior. The second and third parts are in close relation to the seventh and eighth cervical and first thoracic ventral rami, and to the middle and lower trunks of the brachial plexus. The subclavian artery becomes the axillary artery at the outer border of the first rib. The axillary artery is closely related to the divisions of the brachial plexus deep to the clavicle, and to the cords below it.

The artery divides into the radial and ulnar arteries just distal to the elbow. The ulnar artery is consistently the larger of the two. The common interosseous artery arises close to its origin and subsequently divides into the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries. The anterior interosseous artery, accompanied by the anterior interosseous nerve, lies on the interosseous membrane in the deepest part of the deep flexor compartment. The posterior interosseous artery is separated from the membrane by the deep extensor muscles. The radial and ulnar arteries remain in the flexor compartment of the forearm, the ulnar artery moving towards the ulnar nerve in the proximal quarter of the forearm; it is usually the dominant vessel for the hand. At the wrist, the radial artery passes dorsally and crosses the scaphoid and trapezium.</div><div class="text" id="p0115">Important branches from the main axial vessels form extensive anastomoses that provide a collateral circulation. For example, the collateral circulation formed by branches of the thyrocervical trunk with the circumflex humeral and subscapular arteries permits survival of the limb after occlusion of either the third part of the subclavian artery, or of the axillary artery deep to the clavicle and pectoralis minor. The <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="874" id="pagebreak_874"/><a id="pg873.e1"/>profunda brachii is an important channel for the posterior muscles of the arm. It accompanies the radial nerve and contributes to the collateral circulation about the elbow with the ulnar collateral and recurrent vessels and the radial collateral and recurrent vessels. The anterior interosseous artery is effectively an end artery. A series of anastomoses between the radial and ulnar arteries, such as the transversely orientated palmar and dorsal arches and the superficial and deep palmar arches, maintain a rich blood supply to the wrist and hand. There are extensive interconnections between these arches and between the dorsal and palmar phalangeal arteries.</div><section><a id="s0050"/><section><a id="s1050"/><h4 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0050">Pulses</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0120">The pulsation of the subclavian artery is palpable at the lateral margin of sternocleidomastoid and is easily blocked by digital pressure against the first rib.

Sometimes, only the superior margins of the vein rise above the medial end of the clavicle; sometimes, the entire vein does so. The phrenic nerve and the inferior part of scalenus anterior lie posteriorly. The subclavian vein joins the internal jugular vein to form the brachiocephalic vein at the medial border of scalenus anterior, behind the sternoclavicular joint (see <a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355.xhtml#f0075">Fig. 35.14</a>).

Although nerve conduction is lost before muscle contractility, ischaemia is more likely to produce infarction of muscle than necrosis of nerve. Decompression of a nerve embedded within muscle that has become fibrosed by ischaemia usually leads to relief of pain and considerable improvement in sensation and sympathetic function, even when delayed for some months.</div><div class="text" id="p0140">Anoxia occurs either because of cessation of flow through a main axial artery or as a result of increasing pressure within an osseofascial compartment caused by bleeding, infusion of fluid or sepsis. It destroys the integrity of the cell membrane and capillary endothelium, which means that the homeostatic balance between the intravascular, extracellular and intracellular spaces is lost. Tissue death is imminent.</div><div class="text" id="p0145">The increased permeability of the vascular endothelium leads to an increase in intracompartmental pressure by exudation, which collapses the low-pressure lymphatic and venous systems. The final event is the closure or obstruction of perfusing arterioles to muscles and the extrinsic supply to nerves, when tissue or extravascular pressure exceeds the cortical closing pressure of those vessels. The vicious circle is complete. The fluid entering the compartment cannot get out and continues to leak into the compartment until the pressure is so high that inflow is blocked. Increasing intracompartmental pressure occurs when the collateral circulation is inadequate after occlusion of the main artery or after restoration of flow through that vessel, unless the compartments have been decompressed adequately by fasciotomy. The vascular anastomoses about the joints of the upper limb provide a richer collateral circulation than those found in the lower limb. In a study of nearly 2500 World War II battle casualties, at a time when ligation of damaged arteries was common, ligation of the popliteal artery led to amputation in 346 of 502 limbs. By contrast, the incidence of amputation after ligation was about one-quarter for the subclavian artery, one-third for the axillary artery and more than one-half when the brachial artery was ligated proximal to the profunda brachii artery. These figures are certainly lower in the less contaminated injuries of civilian life, but some degree of post-ischaemic fibrosis is almost inevitable after failure to repair these vessels. The principles of arterial repair include urgent restoration of flow by repair of the artery and restoration of tissue perfusion by decompression. Temporary intraluminal shunts are invaluable, as they buy time and permit adequate stabilization of the skeleton. Application of these principles in current conflicts ensures a remarkably high rate of limb survival and a remarkably low incidence of post-ischaemic fibrosis.</div><div class="text" id="p0150">Flow through the brachial artery in adults and in children has been measured by high-resolution ultrasonography. Flow was calculated by the Laplace equation: BF (blood flow)= [π×(D/2)]<sup>2</sup>×FV (flow velocity).

The radial and ulnar nerves are often entrapped or compressed in fracture dislocations at the elbow, blocking flow through the ulnar and radial collateral systems that accompany these nerves.</div><div class="text" id="p0165">The presence of peripheral pulses does not indicate adequate perfusion of the deep intracompartmental tissues, neither does the perfusion of skin or the nail bed when pulses are absent. The cardinal symptom of ischaemic anoxia is severe pain and the cardinal sign is loss of nerve conduction. This can be confirmed during exposure of limb nerves with an inflated tourniquet cuff in position proximally. For about 20 minutes, stimulation of the nerve evokes a brisk muscular response as a consequence of transmission through the neuromuscular junction. This response diminishes and disappears after about 30 minutes, although conduction within the nerve itself can still be detected for up to another 20 minutes. However, direct stimulation of the muscle provokes a twitch that can be elicited for up to several hours. Indeed, it is the loss of this direct response that signifies impending death of the muscle, and with it, death of the limb. The earliest nerve fibres to suffer are the largest, i.e. those conveying vibration and proprioception sense.</div></section><section><a id="s0070"/><section><a id="s6065"/><section><a id="s0065"/><section><a id="s1070"/><h3 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0070">Ischaemia and acute compression within neurovascular fascial compartments</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0170">Sleeves of fascia surround main nerves and main vessels in some regions, an arrangement that predisposes nerves to injury from ischaemia or compression, or both. The seventh and eighth cervical and first thoracic ventral rami are enclosed in semi-rigid space after they enter the posterior triangle of the neck. This is bounded, posteriorly, by the dorsal part of the first rib, the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae and by the fascia of levator scapulae. The nerves are embraced by scalenus anterior and scalenus medius, both of which are invested in an unyielding fascia. This is one envelope of the prevertebral fascia that also serves to bind the phrenic nerve down to the anterior face of scalenus anterior. The prevertebral fascia is particularly well developed in front of the vertebral column and also at the base of the posterior triangle, where it envelops the seventh and eighth cervical and first thoracic ventral rami, the phrenic nerve, the cervical sympathetic chain, and the subclavian and vertebral arteries.

Bleeding into this compartment is responsible for the majority of infraclavicular plexopathies that follow regional block, and for many of the neurological lesions that result from closed or even open injuries in this region. The anterior interosseous nerve and its accompanying artery may be damaged by compression because of swelling in the deepest part of the flexor compartment of the forearm. The ulnar nerve, accompanied by the ulnar artery, lies in a discrete fascial compartment in the distal two-thirds of the forearm.</div><div class="text" id="p0175">Bleeding into the axillary fascia (the medial antebrachial compartment) causes a characteristic, progressive lesion. There is, almost always, pain accompanied by dysaesthesiae; loss of sensation soon follows and then, over the next 2–3 hours, paralysis ensues. Wilbourn’s comment bears repeating: Distal pulses are normal as they are with most compartment syndromes because the elevated pressure, although sufficient to collapse the vasa nervorum, is far below mean arterial pressure. Ultrasound, MR and CT may reveal the vascular lesion, but, considering the very brief time available for surgical decompression before irreversible nerve damage occurs, obtaining these is rarely justified.</div><div class="text" id="p0180">In one series of 16 patients (<a href="#bib35" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_35">Stenning et al 2005</a>), there was, in all cases, an injury to the axillary artery or one of its offsets, caused by dislocation of the shoulder or fracture of the proximal humerus.

Important branches pass from the vertebral artery to the fifth and sixth cervical ventral rami and the more proximal cervical nerves. Branches from the costocervical trunk provide a rich supply to the eighth cervical and first thoracic ventral rami. Extensive contributions come from the suprascapular and superficial cervical arteries that arise from the thyrocervical trunk. In at least one-third of cases, the superficial cervical and dorsal scapular arteries arise from the thyrocervical trunk as the transverse cervical artery. In clinical terms, the arteries arising from the thyrocervical trunk have become the lifeline to the upper limb and must be preserved during operations in cases when the ruptured subclavian artery has not been repaired. The dorsal scapular artery may arise from the third part of the subclavian artery to pass between the upper and middle trunks of the brachial plexus.<a id="pg878"/></div><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="878" id="pagebreak_878"/></div></section></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0205"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0150">Trunks of the brachial plexus</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0345">The upper trunk is formed by the fifth and sixth cervical ventral rami, where these nerves emerge from deep to scalenus anterior. The middle trunk is the continuation of the seventh cervical ventral ramus. The lower trunk is formed by the eighth cervical and first thoracic ventral rami, and passes over the anterosuperior surface of the first rib. The first thoracic ventral ramus takes an upward course across the deep face of the neck of the first rib behind the pleura and the vertebral and subclavian arteries towards the lower trunk. The formation of the trunks is fairly consistent; they lie in front of one another rather than side by side, with the subclavian artery passing anteromedially. The phrenic nerve crosses the fifth cervical ventral ramus to pass anteromedially on the surface of scalenus anterior. The upper trunk, its divisions and the suprascapular nerve can all be palpated in the supraclavicular fossa in a subject of normal physique. The examining finger identifies first the subclavian pulse and then the nerves, whilst rolling the fingertip laterally (see Video 48.1).</div></section><section><a id="s0210"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0155">Divisions of the brachial plexus</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0350">The trunks divide into anterior and posterior divisions.

Immediately inferior to the clavicle, the posterior cord is lateral, the medial cord is posterior, and the lateral cord is anterior, in relation to the axillary artery; the cords assume their appropriate relations about the axillary artery deep to pectoralis minor. There is considerable variation in this arrangement; most commonly, the axillary artery lies anterior to the three cords and the median nerve.</div><div class="text" id="p0365">The branches of the posterior cord, the largest of the three trunks, are consistent. In sequence, they are the upper subscapular, thoracodorsal, lower subscapular, axillary and radial nerves. The branches of the medial cord are usually predictable; the medial pectoral nerve and medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm are succeeded by the division into the medial root of the median nerve and the ulnar nerve. The ulnar nerve may arise as two or three branches. The greatest variation in formation of trunk nerves is found within the lateral cord. Occasionally, the musculocutaneous nerve arises more distally than usual, either directly from the lateral cord as two or three branches or even from the median nerve itself.

The nerve(s) to the lateral head of triceps arise(s) within the spiral groove; that to the lateral head just before the radial nerve re-enters the anterior compartment. Two cutaneous nerves, the lower lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm and the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm, pass away from the main nerve in the final part of the spiral groove and course along the anterior face of the lateral head of triceps to perforate the deep fascia about four fingers’-breadths above the lateral epicondyle. They innervate the skin of the lower lateral arm and the posterior aspect of the forearm. The nerve to brachioradialis is formed about three fingers’-breadths proximal to the lateral epicondyle; the nerve to extensor carpi radialis longus about one finger’s-breadth more distal; and that to extensor carpi radialis brevis about one finger’s-breadth above the epicondyle. These branches spring from the main nerve as it runs in the valley between brachialis anteriorly and brachioradialis posteriorly, where the nerve may be palpated. At the level of the tip of the lateral epicondyle, the radial nerve divides into the posterior interosseous and superficial radial nerves. Another branch to extensor carpi radialis brevis is usually given off here. The superficial radial nerve innervates the skin over the dorsum of the radial half of the ring, middle and index fingers, and that of the thumb as far as the distal interphalangeal joint.

The fifth and sixth cervical ventral rami receive grey rami from the middle cervical ganglion; the seventh and eighth cervical ventral rami receive grey rami from the inferior cervical ganglion; the first thoracic ventral ramus not only receives a grey ramus from the inferior cervical ganglion but also contributes a white ramus to it (see <a href="../B9780702077050000240/B9780702077050000240.xhtml#f0070">Fig. 24.13</a>; <a href="#f0100"><span class="bold">Fig. 48.16</span></a>).

The history is important: high injury transfer, open fracture and wounding (be it accidental, criminal, surgical, or all three) indicate a serious lesion and advice from witnesses or emergency paramedical staff is always valuable. Injuries that potentially threaten life or limb complicate closed traction lesions of the supraclavicular brachial plexus in about 20% of cases. It is important to seek occult injuries to the head, spine, thorax, abdomen and pelvis before embarking on treatment of the nerve lesion(s).</div><div class="text" id="p0460">The early symptoms of acute nerve injury include: abnormal spontaneous sensations; alteration or loss of sensibility; weakness and paralysis; impairment of function; an awareness of warming and dryness of all or part of an extremity (sometimes); and pain (sometimes). Neuropathic pain is never easy to recognize in an injured patient, who is probably confused, distressed and in pain. It can be distinguished from the pain of fracture or dislocation by loss of sensation; painful, spontaneous sensory symptoms, expressed throughout the territory of the nerve; and by lancinating or shooting pain, radiating into the distribution of the nerve. Constant crushing, bursting or burning pain in an otherwise undamaged hand indicates serious and continuing injury to major trunk nerves more proximally. Progression of sensory loss, with a deep bursting or crushing pain within the muscles of the limb, signifies critical ischaemia.</div><div class="text" id="p0465">The main nerves are stretched, ruptured or avulsed from muscle by violent hyperextension–abduction injuries of the arm. The axillary or brachial artery may be damaged by fracture of the proximal humerus or fracture-dislocation of the shoulder but such injuries are relatively uncommon (<a href="#bib27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_27">Menendez and Ring 2015</a>). The axillary nerve and posterior circumflex vessels, which pass almost horizontally posterior to the neck of the humerus, are particularly at risk from anterior dislocation of the head of the humerus. The radial nerve and the profunda brachii artery are relatively fixed where they pass from the anterior to the posterior compartment by perforating the medial intermuscular septum in the axilla, and again when they re-emerge into the anterior compartment by perforating the lateral intermuscular septum. They may be stretched, ruptured or entrapped by displaced fractures of the shaft of the humerus. The median, ulnar and radial nerves may be subjected to traction, or entrapment, by fracture or dislocation about the elbow. The median nerve is severely compressed by fractures or dislocations impinging on the carpal tunnel. All nerves may be transected by wounds from a knife, glass, a bullet or other missile anywhere along their course. The axillary artery and its main branches are commonly involved in nerve injuries. Wounds of the median nerve in the arm commonly extend to the brachial artery, and the ulnar artery is usually involved in wounds to the ulnar nerve in the forearm and at the wrist.</div><div class="text" id="p0470">Nerves and their related structures may be displaced by fracture, dislocation or haematoma. The ensuing fibrosis distorts normal anatomical relations; this increases the risk of intraoperative damage when nerves and accompanying vessels are not formally exposed. The incidence of such iatrogenic injuries is increasing and accounts for one-quarter of lesions of the radial nerve: the incidence is even higher for nerves around the elbow.</div><div class="text" id="p0475">Injuries to nerves of cutaneous sensation are common after wounds, incisions or vessel puncture. It is remarkable that the elective removal of nerves such as the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm for the purpose of grafting is followed by pain only very rarely, while lesions of the terminal branches are usually painful. The medial cutaneous nerve of the arm and the intercostobrachial nerve are at risk during operations in the axilla. The posterior cutaneous nerves of the arm and forearm are vulnerable during the lateral approach to the shaft of the humerus. The medial and lateral cutaneous nerves of the forearm are frequently damaged during operations around the elbow. The dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve is at risk during operations on the distal third of the ulna. The superficial radial and lateral cutaneous nerves are frequently injured by interventions on the lateral side of the wrist. Injuries to the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve and to the digital nerves are unwelcome complications of operations on the hand. These injuries cause pain, which may become severe. Mechanical allodynia, the perception of light touch as pain, is common; the spread of pain and allodynia beyond the territory of an injured nerve is frequent and indicates central sensitization of other neurones in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.</div><section><a id="s0270"/><section><a id="s7270"/><h3 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0210">Examination</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0480">Examination complements the history and the interpretation of symptoms to provide an accurate diagnosis. All findings should be set down in an intelligible record. Unfortunately, the signs of acute nerve injury have to be sought at a time when the patient may be least able to cooperate in an examination: soon after wounding, when there is likely to be distress and when the general condition may be affected by loss of blood and other injuries and/or by drink and drugs. The examination often has to be undertaken in the frequently unfavourable surroundings of an accident department. When the lesion has been inflicted by a surgeon or anaesthetist, the patient’s response is likely to be distorted by postoperative pain, by the effects of recent general anaesthesia or by sedative or analgesic drugs. These are inappropriate conditions for a quiet and comprehensive ‘neurological examination’, and yet this is the time when the fact of nerve injury must at least be recognized if the best result is to be obtained from treatment. The examiner should, at all times, bear in mind the fact that, if there is a wound over the line of a main nerve and if there is any suggestion of loss of sensibility or impairment of motor function in the distribution of that nerve, it must be regarded as having been cut until and unless it is proved otherwise.</div></section><section><a id="s0275"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0215">Local signs in closed injury</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0485">In closed injuries, swelling or ecchymosis and linear abrasions indicate severe soft tissue injury and also the line of application of force (see <a href="#f0185">Fig. 48.29</a>).

A further distinction is made between wounds caused by a handgun, rifle and close-range shotgun, the latter being particularly destructive. The injuries of current conflicts are classed as penetrating missile wound; (small) fragment wound; and blast wound, those from mines or improvised explosive devices (IEDs).</div></section><section><a id="s3290"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0225">Sensation</h4><div class="textfl" id="p6200">Sensory loss is determined by response to light touch and pinprick.

Injuries in the arm cause paralysis of all muscles innervated by the median nerve, including those arising from the medial epicondyle (flexor carpi radialis, pronator teres, palmaris longus, and part of flexor digitorum superficialis), as well as those innervated by the anterior interosseous nerve (flexor pollicis longus, flexor digitorum profundus to index finger) (see <a href="#f0160">Fig. 48.24</a>). Anterior interosseous palsy is distinguished from high median injury by the absence of any loss of skin sensation. Abductor pollicis brevis is the one small muscle of the hand that is consistently innervated by the median nerve.</div></section><section><a id="s0325"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0265">Ulnar nerve</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0540">The sensory loss is related to the involvement of the dorsal and palmar cutaneous branches (see <a href="#f0175">Fig. 48.27</a>). Ulnar palsy with paralysis of flexor carpi ulnaris places a lesion in the arm. Paralysis confined to the hand places a lesion in the distal half of the forearm. Preservation of the hypothenar muscles with paralysis of the other hand muscles innervated by the ulnar nerve places a lesion in the proximal part of the palm of the hand. There is no cutaneous sensory loss in a palsy of the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. The posture of the digits is characteristic in ulnar nerve lesions.</div><div class="text" id="p0545">The examiner should bear in mind the possibility of anatomical variation and also the ability for other muscles to compensate for the actions of those paralysed by what are termed ‘trick movements’. In fact, these muscles are acting appropriately and the movements are real enough (see <a href="#f0155">Fig. 48.23B</a>).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0330"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0270">Depth of a lesion</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0550">The distinction between conduction block and severance of an axon (axonotmesis or neurotmesis) is sometimes difficult. Serious injuries are likely to cause serious lesions of nerves. Severance of a nerve with a cutaneous sensory component will lead to well-defined loss of sensibility and to complete motor, sudomotor and vasomotor paralysis in the distribution of the nerve. Simple conduction block is likely to produce a patchy loss of sensibility and patchy motor loss. Further, it is likely to bear more heavily on the large axons than on the small ones. Vibration sense and sensibility to light touch are likely to be impaired, whereas pain sensibility may be unaffected. There is a risk of underestimating the severity of a nerve lesion in cases of closed injury and after intraoperative events. Different populations of nerve fibres within a main nerve that has been violently stretched but not ruptured sustain lesions of all grades of severity. Some remain intact, whilst conduction is blocked in others. Some ruptured axons will recover spontaneously, whilst others will not, depending on their cellular microenvironment (see <a href="../B9780702077050000872/B9780702077050000872.xhtml#B9780702077050000872">Commentary 1.6</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0555">Testing of sensibility is often difficult soon after wounding, or when nerve injury is associated with fracture of a long bone. The actions of some muscles can be simulated by the actions of others, so that the fact of paralysis can be missed in the early stages after nerve injury. Thus, when the median nerve has been cut, opposition of the thumb can be mimicked by the action of extensor pollicis brevis (posterior interosseous nerve) and abductor pollicis longus (radial nerve). Similarly, abductor pollicis longus can imitate the action of the abductor pollicis brevis. It is important to examine both hands, especially in the early days, when there is no wasting to guide the examiner. One almost infallible sign is always present in the first 48 hours after deep injury of a nerve with a cutaneous sensory component: because small, as well as large, fibres are affected, the skin in the distribution of the damaged nerve is warm and dry. In a small child, there may be an abnormal posture of the denervated digits; the ‘immersion test’ is also helpful. The injured hand or foot is placed, for a few minutes, in warm water; the skin of the denervated digits fails to wrinkle. In ischaemia, the large fibres conveying discriminative sensibility and vibration sense are first affected. It is not easy to test these modalities when ischaemia is developing because of the damage to a main vessel that is associated with a fracture of a long bone, but if action is not taken until superficial sensibility is lost, it will come too late.</div><section><a id="s0335"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0275">Tinel’s sign</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0560">In closed injuries, percussion of the skin over a nerve in which axons have been ruptured evokes sensations usually described as a wave or surge of pins and needles into the cutaneous distribution of the nerve. This is Tinel’s sign and it is a most useful aid to diagnosis. The sign can be elicited on the day of injury in most conscious patients. It indicates not only where the nerve has been injured but also the fact that at least some axons have been ruptured. Tinel’s sign can be detected from such ‘motor’ nerves as the posterior interosseous nerve; sensory symptoms radiate into muscular territory rather than into skin. It is more difficult to elicit the sign over deep-seated nerves such as the axillary, eighth cervical or first thoracic nerves.</div><section><a id="s0340"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0280">Eliciting Tinel’s sign in closed lesions</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0565">The examiner’s finger taps along the course of the nerve from distal to proximal, starting below the presumed level of the lesion. The patient is asked to say when the advancing finger elicits a wave or a surge of pins and needles or abnormal sensations, which may be painful, into the distribution of the nerve, which must be clearly indicated by the examiner. The level of the sign should be measured from a fixed bony point and the distance recorded. At times, the examination is painful and patients need to be warned of this. A Tinel’s sign that remains static at the level of a lesion strongly suggests rupture of the nerve or persisting local conditions inimical to spontaneous regeneration.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="8.820001E6" id="pagebreak_8.820001E6"/><a id="pg882.e5"/></div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0345"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0285">Injuries of the supraclavicular brachial plexus</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0575">The closed traction lesion of the supraclavicular brachial plexus is amongst the worst of all peripheral nerve injuries because of the frequent association with injury to the spinal cord and the usual complication of severe pain. There is one common element: the violent distraction of the forequarter from the head, neck and chest so that the angle between the head and the shoulder is opened. One important physical sign that illustrates this point is the presence of linear abrasions and bruising at the tip of the shoulder (<a href="#f0185"><span class="bold">Fig. 48.29</span></a>).

These injuries are called preganglionic because the lesion lies between the dorsal root ganglion and the spinal cord. This concept of pre- and postganglionic injury, introduced by Bonney in 1954, is fundamental to diagnosis and treatment. The preganglionic injury is the most common lesion because the union of the ventral and dorsal roots is the weakest link in the long chain between the central nervous system and the periphery. Postganglionic rupture usually involves the ventral ramus, distal to the branching of the dorsal ramus (see <a href="../B9780702077050000471/B9780702077050000471.xhtml#f0025">Figs 47.1</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000471/B9780702077050000471.xhtml#f0050">47.7</a>). In one series of 200 patients operated on between the years 2000 and 2004, 429 spinal nerves sustained preganglionic rupture, 223 were postganglionic ruptures and the remaining 298 spinal nerves were intact or recovering. The fifth and sixth cervical nerves are somewhat protected by proximal branches to such nerves as the phrenic and long thoracic, and also by the transverse radicular ligaments. The vulnerability of C8 and T1 is enhanced by the increasing obliquity of the roots in the spinal canal and the angulated course of T1.</div><div class="text" id="p0585">There are two types of preganglionic, intradural, injury: rupture peripheral to the transitional zone and avulsion central to it (<a href="#f0190"><span class="bold">Figs 48.30</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0195"><span class="bold">48.31</span></a>; see also <a href="../B9780702077050000033/B9780702077050000033.xhtml#f0190">Fig. 3.37</a>).

The preganglionic (sympathetic) ramus of the first thoracic ventral ramus connects it to the stellate ganglion; the postganglionic ramus is less noticeable. The size and disposition of scalenus anterior vary: it may bifurcate to include the artery; it may be bulky and its tendon may curve posteriorly round the artery to form a kind of snare. Deep to scalenus anterior, a very thin fascia covers the artery. The phrenic nerve, chiefly derived from the fourth cervical ventral ramus, curves round the muscle to run down anterior to it into the thorax, lying, at first, posterior to the internal jugular vein and crossing behind the subclavian vein. The thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct enter the brachiocephalic vein at the subclavian–jugular (triradiate) junction on the left and right, respectively. All of the scalene muscles vary in formation and size. Bridges of muscle and fascia may pass between them, altering and diminishing the space available for the neurovascular bundles.</div></section><section><a id="s0485"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0390">Seventh cervical rib</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0720">Estimates of incidence range from 0.004% to 1%.

Astley Cooper wrote, ‘I have seen an exostosis arise from the 6th or 7th cervical vertebrae or perhaps from both’ (<a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Cooper and Travers 1817</a>). He went on to describe the case of a woman who came into Guy’s Hospital with no pulse at the wrist or elbow and with ‘venous redness’ of the upper limb, which was cold, ‘ennumbed’ and painful; she also had a projection of the lower cervical vertebrae towards the clavicle, with consequent pressure on the subclavian artery. <a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Coote (1861)</a> reported the removal of a left seventh cervical rib causing aneurysm of the subclavian artery. Two physicians, <a href="#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Lewis and Pickering (1934)</a>, pointed to the mechanism of production of the arterial lesion, namely: intimal breakage with local thrombosis and distal embolization. Arterial affection occurs as the subclavian artery crosses a ‘normal’ first rib or a seventh cervical rib, commonly one with bony union to, or synchondrosis or synostosis with, a boss on the first rib at about its middle part. The vessel is distorted by the bone and constricted by a leash formed by the tendon of insertion of scalenus anterior. There is commonly dilation of the artery distal to the point of constriction, and the dilation may proceed to the formation of a true aneurysm (<a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">Wickham and Martin 1962</a>). Complete obstruction of the main vessel with distal embolization may lead to critical ischaemia. The most dangerous complication is contralateral hemiplegia, doubtless from embolization from a thrombus extending proximally to the carotid vessel (<a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">Symonds 1927</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0730">The arterial form of this outlet syndrome is a condition predominantly affecting young women; the occurrence of such symptoms in older individuals must suggest a primary diagnosis of atherosclerosis or other systemic disorder. The symptoms are initially those of Raynaud’s disease with episodic blanching and temperature change, episodic pain with muscular activity, and distal ulceration and necrosis. The extremity may be cooler than the unaffected limb and there is likely to be a pulse difference, even the absence of a pulse. Even if the hands are the same colour at rest and slightly dependent, there is likely to be blanching of the affected hand on elevation. The artery is prominent, displaced upwards and anteriorly by the underlying rib; there is a loud bruit and there may be a thrill. Doppler ultrasound examination is likely to show an abnormality: principally, a clamped, monophasic velocity signal anywhere over the arterial tree of the upper limb (<a href="#bib30" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_30">Parry and Eastcott 1992</a>). Radiographs will, of course, show a seventh cervical rib if one is present. Magnetic resonance angiography and duplex ultrasonography have generally superseded arteriography in this field, as in others, and will confirm the site and extent of the obstruction, the extent of stenosis and aneurysm formation, and the degree of distal occlusion (<a href="#f0295"><span class="bold">Fig. 48.51</span></a>).</div><div id="p0805"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0275"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000483/main.assets/on48-38a-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000483/main.assets/on48-38b-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000483/main.assets/on48-38c-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0320"/><a id="fspara0310"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 48.51</span> Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome: angiographic appearances. <span class="bold">A</span>, Complete occlusion over a cervical rib. <span class="bold">B</span>, Complete occlusion at the thoracic outlet in a 40-year-old woman, a heavy smoker. <span class="bold">C</span>, Obstruction of the artery at the thoracic outlet on elevation of the limb. <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Rolfe Birch, all rights reserved, published in Birch R, Surgical Disorders of the Peripheral Nerve. 2nd edition, 2011.

It may be indicated when a cervical rib is present, causing no symptoms but producing deformity of the subclavian artery sufficient to cause a steady bruit over the vessel, which must surely indicate distortion of the vessel that is likely, in time, to cause intimal breakage and thrombosis. Arterial TOS is uncommon rather than rare and it is potentially dangerous. The bruit from a prominent subclavian artery associated with an underlying seventh cervical rib cannot be ignored and investigations need to be pursued to define the extent of distortion of the artery.</div></section><section><a id="s0495"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0400">True neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0740">Neurogenic TOS is rare. As <a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Gilliatt (1984)</a> pointed out, a number of cases were seen at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases, Queen Square, London, UK, in the early years of the last century, with wasting of the thenar muscles that was attributed to a cervical rib. In fact, these patients probably had a carpal tunnel syndrome. The confusion was not resolved for more than 40 years until the application of nerve conduction studies defined the much more common disorder. Gilliatt put the annual incidence of cervical rib syndrome with muscle wasting as low as 1 in 1 million in the general population. The patients are usually young to middle-aged women and the abnormalities are usually confined to one upper limb. The symptoms are insidious and often mild; presentation is delayed for some years, and is usually occasioned by the sudden realization that the hand has become wasted. There is pain in the medial aspect of the forearm and there may also be some blunting of sensibility in that area and in the little finger. The latter is frequently shorter than it is in a normal, age-matched hand, suggesting that the affliction of the fibres in the lower trunk commenced before skeletal maturity. There is wasting of the superficial thenar muscles, which sometimes extends to all of the small muscles of the hands (<a href="#f0300"><span class="bold">Fig. 48.52</span></a>) and there may be weakness of the flexor muscles of the forearm, most evident in those innervated by the ulnar nerve. There may be a bruit over the subclavian artery. Radiographs of the neck show rudimentary cervical ribs or elongated transverse processes of the seventh cervical vertebrae. The diagnostic electrophysiological findings were characterized by <a href="#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_21">Gilliatt, Le Quesne and Logue in 1970</a> and include a small or absent sensory response in the ulnar nerve and the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm; a normal sensory response in the median nerve; an attenuated compound motor action potential amplitude from abductor pollicis brevis; and a low-amplitude ulnar motor response (<a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Smith and Knight 2011</a>).

The deltoid tendon is palpable approximately halfway down the lateral aspect of the shaft of the humerus. Its anterior border can be traced superomedially across the anterior aspect of the humerus and the tendon of pectoralis major, to the lateral clavicle; it forms the lateral boundary of the deltopectoral triangle (see <a href="#f0075">Fig. 48.53A</a>, Video 48.1). The posterior border runs superomedially from the posterior aspect of the deltoid tendon and reaches the crest of the scapular spine near its medial end. The normal rounded contour of the shoulder is produced by deltoid covering the lateral aspect of the greater tubercle of the humerus. Shoulder dislocation results in the loss of the normal rounded contour of the shoulder because the greater tubercle is displaced medially, and deltoid consequently descends vertically to its humeral attachment.

It tapers superiorly, where it is covered by pectoralis major, and inferiorly where it continues as the biceps tendon just above the elbow joint. Flexion of the elbow against resistance aids identification of the muscle and of the bicipital tendon, which can be held between finger and thumb and traced inferiorly into the cubital fossa. With the elbow held in resisted flexion, the sharp upper margin of the bicipital aponeurosis can be traced passing inferomedially over the elevated mass of the superficial group of forearm flexor muscles. Coracobrachialis passes inferolaterally from the coracoid process, emerges from the lateral axillary wall and forms a rounded ridge near to the upper part of the medial side of biceps.</div><div class="text" id="p6830">On the posterior arm, the lateral head of triceps forms a laterally placed elevation, inferior to the posterior border of deltoid (see <a href="#f0075">Fig. 48.53C</a>).

The area on the medial side of flexor carpi radialis tendon is packed with important structures. The median nerve is either covered by, or situated just lateral to, the tendon of palmaris longus. The latter can be identified by gently pinching the tips of the digits together and partially flexing the wrist (see <a href="#f0080">Fig. 48.54A</a>). Near to the wrist, the median nerve lies very close to the skin and can, therefore, be injured by relatively superficial lacerations.

The four tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis lie deep to the median nerve; the tendons to the middle and ring fingers lie anterior to those for the index and little fingers as they pass deep to the flexor retinaculum, and can be felt and seen to move during finger flexion and extension. Deeper still are the tendons of flexor digitorum profundus. The broad tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris is easily palpated passing to the pisiform on the medial (ulnar) side of the anterior wrist; the ulnar nerve, artery and venae comitantes lie along its lateral (radial) edge. Any sharp injury that cuts through the tendon usually has enough energy to sever the ulnar neurovascular bundle.</div><div class="text" id="p0885">When the thumb is fully extended, the depression of the anatomical snuff-box is visible on the lateral aspect of the wrist immediately distal to the radial styloid process (see <a href="#f0080">Fig. 48.54C</a>). The snuff-box is bounded on its anterolateral side by the tendons of abductor pollicis longus (laterally) and extensor pollicis brevis (immediately medial), and on its posteromedial side by the tendon of extensor pollicis longus. Running a finger along extensor pollicis brevis may enable palpation of the superficial radial nerve, which can be rolled from side to side on the tendon.

Its pulsations are palpable along this line of travel and proximal to the bicipital aponeurosis, via compression against the humerus. Brachial artery catheterization just proximal to the aponeurosis is used for coronary angiography or cardiac catheterization. The ability to compress the brachial artery against the humerus makes the arm the favoured site for non-invasive blood pressure measurement. The median nerve is intimately related to the brachial artery throughout its course in the arm. Proximally, it sits lateral to the artery; around the midpoint of the arm, it passes anterior to the artery and descends on its medial side to the cubital fossa.</div><div class="text" id="p0875">The radial and ulnar arteries originate in the anterior forearm at a point situated medial to the bicipital tendon at the level of the lower head/neck of the radius (see <a href="#f0075">Fig. 48.53B</a>). From here, the ulnar artery passes inferomedially to a point one-third of the way down flexor carpi ulnaris (which passes along a line joining the medial humeral epicondyle to the pisiform). The ulnar artery and nerve then pass inferiorly to a point just lateral to the pisiform along the line of flexor carpi ulnaris, with the ulnar artery lying on the lateral (radial) side of the nerve. The radial artery passes inferolaterally through the forearm, from its point of origin to a point just lateral to the tendon of flexor carpi radialis, anterior to the distal radius. The upper part of its course can be represented by a line that passes deep to the medial part of the elevation produced by brachioradialis on the anterior aspect of the forearm.

Thrombosis or vasospasm of the radial artery at this site should not normally jeopardize the circulation to the hand since the interconnecting palmar arterial arches provide a collateral circulation to the hand. Allen’s test, and ideally Doppler ultrasound, should be performed prior to invasive procedures to determine the presence of collateral circulation from the ulnar artery.</div><section><a id="s0535"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle7440">Allen’s test</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0895">Allen’s test examines the patency of the interconnection between the superficial and deep palmar arches, and determines whether either artery is capable of maintaining the arterial supply to the hand in isolation. To perform the test, the radial and ulnar arteries of one hand are compressed by the examiner’s thumbs. The forearm is then elevated and the hand exsanguinated by clenching the fist. The hand is then opened while arterial compression is continued. The palm of the hand appears pale, unless there is an anomalous arterial supply, e.g. from a persistent median artery. The rapid return of a normal pink colour to the palmar skin following removal of digital pressure from the ulnar artery suggests it is capable of perfusing the hand adequately in isolation. If the palmar skin remains pale, it must be assumed either that there is a distal obstruction to the artery or that the artery cannot adequately perfuse the hand in isolation.

In the forearm and proximal hand, its course corresponds to a line drawn from the base of the posterior aspect of the medial epicondyle of the humerus to the lateral side of the pisiform, where the nerve passes through the ulnar (Guyon’s) canal and its superficial branch often passes superficial to the hook of the hamate. Deep pressure at these bony landmarks can produce paraesthesia in the distribution of the nerve.

Ultrasound guidance is commonly used.</div><div class="text" id="p0985">The interscalene route requires identification of the interscalene groove. The patient is asked to sniff, an action that involves the scalene muscles as accessory muscles of respiration. A needle is inserted perpendicular to the skin and enters the interscalene groove. Paraesthesia may be elicited, and local anaesthetic solution is injected. There is a risk that some local anaesthetic may move in a retrograde direction and reach the cervical epidural space. The proximal nature of the block means that there is almost always some involvement of the phrenic nerve, and sympathetic block (as evidenced by a Horner’s syndrome) is universal.</div><div class="text" id="p0990">The supraclavicular route places local anaesthetic solution in the plane occupied by the trunks of the brachial plexus as they emerge between scalenus anterior and medius on the first rib, immediately posterior to the third part of the subclavian artery.

The needle is directed backwards, inwards and downwards to make contact with the upper surface of the first rib. During this procedure, the patient will usually report paraesthesia within the upper limb, which indicates that the needle is correctly placed; preliminary aspiration ensures that a major vessel has not been punctured. If the first rib is missed, there is the risk of producing a pneumothorax. There is often a transient Horner’s syndrome, caused by diffusion of the local anaesthetic towards the stellate ganglion.</div><div class="text" id="p0995">The axillary approach blocks the nerves as they group around the axillary artery.</div></section><section><a id="s7620"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0505">Wrist</p><div class="textfl" id="p1000">Anaesthesia of the palm of the hand (except for the lateral surface of the thumb base) can be achieved by blockade of the ulnar and median nerves at the wrist (see Video 51.9). The ulnar nerve may be blocked via a needle inserted lateral to the tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris at the wrist. The median nerve may be blocked via a needle inserted at the level of the proximal wrist crease between the tendons of palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis.</div><div class="text" id="p1005">The radial nerve, which supplies the dorsal skin of the hand, may be blocked by injecting local anaesthetic in the subcutaneous tissues around the dorsolateral wrist, where branches of the nerve can be palpated as they pass over tendon of extensor pollicis longus, especially during resisted extension of the thumb.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0625"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0510">Digital nerves</h6><div class="textfl" id="p8010">The digital nerves lie on either side of the flexor sheath in a plane immediately anterior to the phalanx. Therefore, the needle should be inserted on either side of the base of the digit, just anterior to the anterolateral margin of the phalanx. A common alternative approach to blocking the digital nerves is via a dorsal skin approach; the needle is inserted through the dorsal skin on either side of the base of the proximal phalanx and advanced towards the palmar location of the digital nerves while the local anaesthetic agent is continually infused. This is thought to be less painful than the palmar approach because the dorsal skin is less sensitive than the palmar skin.</div></section></section></section></section></section></section><footer><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebib0010"/><h2 class="reftitle" id="s9010">References</h2><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebibsec0010"/><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib1"><!--<a hreef="#bib_1">1</a>. --><a id="ref0015"/><a href="#bib_1">Auerbach</a> D.M, Collins E.D, Kunkle K.L, et al. <cite>The radial sensory nerve: an anatomic study</cite>. <cite><i>Clin Orthop Relat Res</i></cite>. 1994;308:241–249.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib2"><!--<a hreef="#bib_2">2</a>. --><a id="ref0020"/><a href="#bib_2">Berman</a> J, Anand P, Chen L, et al. <cite>Pain relief from preganglionic injury to the brachial plexus by later intercostal transfer</cite>. <cite><i>J Bone Joint Surg Br</i></cite>. 1996;78:759–760.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib3"><!--<a hreef="#bib_3">3</a>. --><a id="ref0025"/><a href="#bib_3">Berman</a> J.S, Birch R, Anand P. <cite>Pain following human brachial plexus injury with spinal cord root avulsion and the effect of surgery</cite>. <cite><i>Pain</i></cite>. 1998;75:199–207.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib4"><!--<a hreef="#bib_4">4</a>. --><a id="ref0030"/><a href="#bib_4">Bono</a> C.M, Grossman M.G, Hochwald N, et al. <cite>Radial and axillary nerves: anatomic considerations for humeral fixation</cite>. <cite><i>Clin Orthop Relat Res</i></cite>. 2000;373:259–264.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib5"><!--<a hreef="#bib_5">5</a>. --><a id="ref0035"/><a href="#bib_5">Birch</a> R. <cite>The closed supraclavicular lesion</cite>. In: <cite><i>Surgical Disorders of the Peripheral Nerves</i></cite>. 2nd ed. London: Springer; 2011:375–429 Ch. 9.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib6"><!--<a hreef="#bib_6">6</a>. --><a id="ref0040"/><a href="#bib_6">Birch</a> R. <cite>Pain</cite>. In: <cite><i>Surgical Disorders of the Peripheral Nerves</i></cite>. 2nd ed. London: Springer; 2011:527–562 Ch. 12.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib7"><!--<a hreef="#bib_7">7</a>. --><a id="ref0045"/><a href="#bib_7">Birch</a> R. <cite>Rehabilitation</cite>. In: <cite><i>Surgical Disorders of the Peripheral Nerves</i></cite>. 2nd ed. London: Springer; 2011:607–630 Ch. 14.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib8"><!--<a hreef="#bib_8">8</a>. --><a id="ref0050"/><a href="#bib_7">Birch</a> R. <cite>Operating on peripheral nerves</cite>. In: <cite><i>Surgical Disorders of the Peripheral Nerves</i></cite>. 2nd ed. London: Springer; 2011:231–302 Ch. 7.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib10"><!--<a hreef="#bib_10">10</a>. --><a id="ref0055"/><a href="#bib_10">Bonney</a> G. <cite>The value of axon responses in determining the site of lesion in traction lesions of the brachial plexus</cite>. <cite><i>Brain</i></cite>. 1954;77:588–609.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib11"><!--<a hreef="#bib_11">11</a>. --><a id="ref0060"/><a href="#bib_11">Bonney</a> G, Gilliatt R.W. <cite>Sensory nerve conduction after traction lesion of the brachial plexus</cite>. <cite><i>Proc R Soc Med</i></cite>. 1958;51:365–367.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib12"><!--<a hreef="#bib_12">12</a>. --><a id="ref0065"/><a href="#bib_12">Bonney</a> G. <cite>Prognosis in traction lesions of the brachial plexus</cite>. <cite><i>J Bone Joint Surg Br</i></cite>. 1959;41:4–35.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib13"><!--<a hreef="#bib_13">13</a>. --><a id="ref0070"/><a href="#bib_13">Camp</a> S.J, Birch R. <cite>Injuries to the spinal accessory nerve: a lesson to surgeons</cite>. <cite><i>J Bone Joint Surg Br</i></cite>. 2011;93:62–67.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib14"><!--<a hreef="#bib_14">14</a>. --><a id="ref0075"/><a href="#bib_14">Cetik</a> O, Uslu M, Acar H.I, et al. <cite>Is there a safe area for the axillary nerve in the deltoid muscle?
