The right respiratory diaphragm is higher than the left, while the anterior and medial parts are higher than the posterior and lateral parts. There are three separate diaphragmatic openings present, the foramen for the inferior vena cava located in the midportion of the central tendon, the oesophageal hiatus located within the right diaphragmatic crus, and the aortic hiatus between the diaphragmatic crura and median arcuate ligament. These openings allow structures to pass through the diaphragm and communicate between the thoracic and abdominopelvic cavities. The motor and sensory innervation of the diaphragm is mainly from the left and right phrenic nerves (C3–C5), with additional contributions from the lower six intercostal nerves. Contraction of the respiratory diaphragm, with assistance from the secondary respiratory muscles, causes a decrease in intrathoracic pressure, which allows air to move down a pressure gradient into the lungs. Relaxation of the respiratory diaphragm and contraction of the abdominal wall muscles causes exhalation because intrathoracic pressure now exceeds atmospheric air pressure. In addition to serving as the primary muscle of ventilation, the respiratory diaphragm also assists with regulation of intra-abdominal pressure, especially during normal bodily functions such as urination and defecation.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">breathing; central tendon; eventration; foramen; hernia; hiatus; phrenic nerve; respiratory diaphragm; right and left crura; trauma</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The respiratory diaphragm is a domed musculofibrous sheet, approximately 2–4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm thick that separates the thoracic and abdominopelvic cavities (<a href="#f0035"><span class="bold">Fig. 55.1</span></a>). The superior surface of the respiratory diaphragm is mainly convex and forms the floor of the thoracic cavity. It is covered by a layer of phrenicopleural fascia, a continuation of the endothoracic fascia, covered in turn by a layer of diaphragmatic parietal pleura, except in the region inferior to the heart, which is covered by a layer of parietal serous pericardium. The concave inferior surface of the respiratory diaphragm forms the roof of the abdominopelvic cavity and is mostly covered by a layer of diaphragmatic fascia, a continuation of the transversalis fascia, which is then covered by a layer of parietal peritoneum. The position of the domes or cupulae of the respiratory diaphragm is variable and may be altered by body position, ventilatory phase, thoracic cavity morphology, height and body mass. Conditions resulting in lung over-inflation, e.g. emphysema, cause diaphragmatic depression or flattening. Usually, after forced expiration, the right dome is level with the fourth costal cartilage anteriorly, whereas the left dome lies approximately one costal cartilage level lower. At end tidal inspiration in the supine position, the domes of the diaphragm descend to sit at the level of the fifth intercostal space anteriorly on the right and sixth rib on the left. On a posteroanterior (PA) chest radiograph at full inspiration, the highest point of the right hemidiaphragm is located at the anterior end of the sixth rib, or at the posterior end of the tenth rib; the left hemidiaphragm is normally 1.5–2.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm lower (see <a href="../B9780702077050000562/B9780702077050000562.xhtml#f0080">Fig. 56.17A</a>).

The diaphragm lies more superiorly in the supine compared to the erect position. In the lateral decubitus position the lowermost gravity-dependent dome of the diaphragm sits at a higher level than the uppermost dome; this results in greater diaphragmatic muscle displacement, and therefore ventilation, on the gravity-dependent side (<a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Froese 2006</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0020">Movement of the respiratory and pelvic diaphragms is often complementary. Magnetic resonance imaging has shown the respiratory and pelvic diaphragms to move symmetrically during normal respiration and other physiological processes: as the respiratory diaphragm descends during inspiration, the pelvic floor also descends in response to the change in intra-abdominal pressure. These changes assist with supporting the trunk and maintaining urinary continence during respiration and coughing (<a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_31">Talasz et al 2011</a>).</div><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Attachments and Components</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0025">The respiratory diaphragm consists of a central tendinous portion, the central tendon, and a muscular peripheral portion. The muscle fibres arise from the circumference of the inferior thoracic aperture and converge to an attachment to the central tendon; the posterior and lateral attachments are therefore located relatively inferior to the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1039" id="pagebreak_1039"/><a id="pg1039"/>anterior attachments (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 55.2</span></a>) (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">du Plessis et al 2015</a>). The muscle can be considered in three parts, sternal, costal and lumbar. The sternal part is the smallest and varies in size and presence, it may be a broad and continuous band or may be absent (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">du Plessis et al 2015</a>). It commonly arises as two muscular strips from the posterior surfaces of the rectus sheath and the xiphoid process, near its apex. On each side, the costal part arises from the internal surfaces and superior margins of the lower six costal cartilages and their adjoining ribs, and interdigitates with transversus abdominis (see <a href="../B9780702077050000537/B9780702077050000537.xhtml#f0145">Fig. 53.15A</a>) (<a href="#bib30" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_30">Sun et al 2016</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000550/main.assets/f55-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 55.2</span> The respiratory diaphragm with attachments, openings and arterial blood and nerve supply. <br/><span class="figcredit">With permission from Drake RL, Vogl AW, Mitchell AWN (eds) Gray’s Anatomy for Students, 3rd ed.

They are covered by connective tissue and are the conduits by which the internal thoracic vessels access the anterior abdominal wall. A retrosternal (parasternal) hernia can pass through the triangles: it is more common on the right side and often congenital, which may reflect a deficit of muscle fibres in this region.</div><div class="text" id="p0035">The lumbar part arises from two aponeurotic arches, the medial and lateral arcuate ligaments (Haller’s or the lumbocostal arches), and asymmetrically from the more superiorly located lumbar vertebral bodies via the left and right crura. The medial arcuate ligament covers the upper part of psoas major. Medially, it is continuous with the lateral tendinous margin of the corresponding crus and is attached to the side of the first or second lumbar vertebral body. Laterally, it is fixed to the anterior aspect of the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra. The lateral arcuate ligament covers and arches across quadratus lumborum, attaching medially to the anterior aspect of the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra, and laterally to the inferior margin of the midpoint of the twelfth rib (<a href="#bib30" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Sun et al 2016</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0040">The lumbocostal triangle (of Bochdalek) represents a developmental defect resulting from an incomplete formation of the pleuroperitoneal membrane. When present, it is located in the posterolateral diaphragm between the lumbar and costal parts, superior to the lateral arcuate ligament. The lumbocostal triangle is devoid of muscle fibres, covered only by the diaphragmatic parietal pleura superiorly and parietal peritoneum inferiorly (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Downey 2011</a>), and is the most common route for congenital diaphragmatic herniation.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">The crura are tendinous at their attachments to the lumbar vertebrae and blend with the anterior longitudinal ligament (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 55.1</a>). The broader and longer right crus arises from the anterolateral surfaces of the bodies and intervertebral discs of the superior three lumbar vertebrae. The left crus arises from the corresponding parts of the superior two lumbar vertebrae and intervertebral disc. The medial tendinous margins of the crura meet in the midline to form the median arcuate ligament, an often poorly defined tendinous arch that crosses anterior to the aorta at the level of the body of the twelfth thoracic vertebra (range, vertebral body of T10–L1). The crura vary greatly in length, thickness and the ratio of muscle to tendon (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">du Plessis et al 2015</a>, <a href="#bib30" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Sun et al 2016</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0050">The muscle fibres of the sternal, costal and lumbar parts of the respiratory diaphragm converge into the central tendon. Fibres from the xiphoid process are short, run almost horizontally and are occasionally aponeurotic. Fibres originating from the medial and lateral arcuate ligaments, and particularly the osteochondral surfaces of the ribs, are much longer. They arise almost vertically at first and then curve towards their central attachment. The right crus is commonly divided into three bundles of fibres (medial, middle and lateral), whereas the left crus is divided into two (medial and lateral) (<a href="#bib5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_5">Botros et al 1990</a>). Muscle fibres from the crura diverge, the most lateral fibres pass more laterally as they ascend to the central tendon. Medial fibres of the right crus ascend and loop around the oesophagus where it passes through the diaphragm at the oesophageal hiatus; the more superficial fibres form the left margin, and the deeper fibres form the right margin of the hiatus. Multiple different patterns of crural muscle fibre arrangement may occur around the oesophageal hiatus (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Loukas et al 2008a</a>). Sometimes, a fleshy fasciculus from the medial side of the left crus crosses the aorta and runs obliquely through the fibres of the right crus towards the caval foramen; this fasciculus does not normally pass around the oesophageal hiatus on the right side.</div><div class="text" id="p0055">The central tendon of the respiratory diaphragm is a thin but strong aponeurosis of closely interwoven fibres situated near the centre of the muscle. In the anteroposterior plane, it sits closer to the anterior thoracic wall, which means that the posterior muscle fibres are longer than the anterior fibres (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 55.3</span></a>). The central region of the central tendon lies immediately inferior to the pericardium, with which it partially blends. This region consists of four diagonal bands of fibres that fan out from a thick central node; from here, compressed tendinous strands decussate anterior to the oesophagus and to the left side of the inferior vena cava.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000550/main.assets/f55-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 55.3</span> Superior and inferior views of the respiratory diaphragm. <span class="bold">A</span>, Superior view showing the relationship between the central tendon and muscular components, and the prominent relationship between the diaphragm and the pericardium.

The right and left folia are tongue-shaped and similar in length, although the left may be narrower; both curve posterolaterally to form a V-shape that spans the midline. The size and shape of the folia and the ratio of diaphragmatic muscle to tendon varies between individuals, the most common arrangement being a V-shaped central tendon and a 10–15% muscle to tendon ratio (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">du Plessis et al 2015</a>). The muscle to tendon ratio can vary disproportionately, such that larger respiratory diaphragms may have a small central tendon, and smaller diaphragms may have a large central tendon and a relatively small amount of muscle.</div></section><section><a id="s0015"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0025">Profile and Relations</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0065">The superior surface of the respiratory diaphragm is covered by three separate serous membranes. On each side, the diaphragmatic parietal pleura separates it from the base of the corresponding lung. Centrally, the parietal pericardium separates mainly the middle folium of the central tendon from the inferior surface of the heart. The middle folium is almost flat and extends more to the left than the right. From an anterior view, the smooth convex domes or cupulae of the left and right sides of the diaphragm rise above the middle folium: the right cupula is higher and slightly broader than the left. Most of the inferior surface of the diaphragm is covered by diaphragmatic fascia and parietal peritoneum. The right cupula conforms to the convex surface of the right lobe of the liver, right kidney and right suprarenal gland; the left cupula conforms to the surface of the left lobe of the liver, gastric fundus, spleen, left kidney and left suprarenal gland. Given the differences in their profiles and anatomical relationships, clinical descriptions of the respiratory diaphragm should always reference a specific side.</div><div class="text" id="p0070">The diaphragm is connected to closely related organs by various connective tissue formations known as ligaments. Within the thoracic cavity, the inferior pulmonary ligament, a double-layered fold of parietal pleura, connects the inferior part of the hilum and root of the lung and the mediastinal surface of the inferior lobe of the lung to the diaphragm. The phrenico-oesophageal ligament, formed from peri-oesophageal areolar tissue, connects the diaphragm to the oesophagus as it passes through the oesophageal hiatus. Within the abdominopelvic cavity, a number of peritoneal formations form a series of supportive ligaments. The falciform ligament connects the anterior surface of the liver to the diaphragm and rectus sheath. The right and left coronary and triangular ligaments pass to the diaphragmatic surface of the liver forming the boundaries of the bare area of the liver. The phrenicosplenic and phrenicocolic ligaments connect the diaphragm to the spleen and splenic flexure of the colon, respectively. The suspensory muscle of the duodenum (ligament of Treitz) is formed from a series of muscular bands that originate from the left crus and connect to the duodenojejunal flexure (<a href="#bib4" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_4">Bordoni and Zanier 2013</a>).</div><section><a id="s0020"/><section><a id="s0025"/><section><a id="s0030"/><section><a id="s0035"/><section><a id="s0040"/><section><a id="s0045"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0030">Ultrasound imaging</p><div class="textfl" id="p0075">Ultrasound examination of the posterior and lateral aspects of the respiratory diaphragm is best undertaken with the patient in the supine position, to limit veiling by other organs and reducing the risk of misdiagnosis due to underlying pulmonary pathologies. The respiratory diaphragm is typically identified by its curved morphology, deep location and specific echotexture. It is visualized as a thin, muscular hypoechoic line wedged between two hyperechoic layers consisting of parietal peritoneum and pleura (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 55.4</span></a>). During inspiration, the hypoechoic line thickens as the muscle contracts, making it more visible. An atrophic diaphragm may be suspected when the thickness of this line does not change during inspiration.

It is the most posteroinferior of the openings, and is commonly found at the level of the superior half of the body of the twelfth thoracic vertebra (range, vertebral body of T10 to L1), slightly to the left of the midline. It is an osseo-aponeurotic opening bordered by the diaphragmatic crura laterally, the vertebral column and anterior longitudinal ligament posteriorly and the median arcuate ligament anteriorly; the aorta therefore normally passes posterior to the diaphragmatic musculature and as such is not affected by its contraction (<a href="#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Nason et al 2012</a>). Occasionally, some tendinous fibres from the medial parts of the crura also pass posterior to the aorta, converting the osseo-aponeurotic hiatus into an aponeurotic fibrous ring.</div><div class="text" id="p0090">The oesophageal hiatus transmits the oesophagus, anterior and posterior vagal trunks, gastric nerves, oesophageal branches of the left gastric vessels and lymphatic vessels. It is commonly located level with the inferior half of the body of the eleventh thoracic vertebra (range, vertebral body of T9 to L1–L2 intervertebral disc), anterosuperior to, and to the left of, the aortic hiatus. The elliptical hiatus has a slightly oblique long axis, and is bounded by muscle fibres that originate from the medial part of the right crus and cross the midline, forming a tunnel approximately 2.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm long that accommodates the distal part of the oesophagus.

Quadrilateral in shape with aponeurotic margins, it is located at the junction of the right folium of the central tendon with the central part. During inspiration, dilation of the caval foramen, combined with increased intra-abdominal pressure, increases cardiac venous return (<a href="#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Nason et al 2012</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0100">Two smaller openings within each crus transmit the greater and lesser thoracic splanchnic nerves.

The resulting increase in intra-abdominopelvic pressure can also be used to provide an anteriorly located pneumatic support to the vertebral column when lifting heavy objects. Repeated mechanical stress may eventually compromise the integrity of the oesophageal hiatus, leading to widening of the muscular hiatal tunnel. Concomitant laxity of the phrenico-oesophageal ligament allows the gastro-oesophageal junction to migrate into the posterior mediastinum, a condition that is normally termed a sliding (type I) hiatus hernia. Sliding hernias are typically acquired in the fifth decade of life, and are found in more than 50% of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux. This reflux induces tonic contraction of the longitudinal oesophageal muscle, further exacerbating the hiatus hernia.</div><div class="text" id="p0120">Herniation of the stomach into the thoracic cavity adjacent to the oesophagus is termed a para-oesophageal (type II) hiatus hernia. There are three distinct types: II, III and IV. Type II refers to a herniated stomach with normal positioning of the gastro-oesophageal junction. Type III, a ‘mixed’ hernia, refers to both a herniated stomach and a sliding-type hernia. Type IV refers to a hernia in which more than one-third of the stomach is herniated into the thoracic cavity. Para-oesophageal herniae can be diagnosed with barium swallow, CT or endoscopy (<a href="#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_8">Daugherty et al 2017</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0090"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0050">Congenital hernia</p><div class="textfl" id="p0125">Congenital respiratory diaphragmatic defects may cause abdominal organs, usually the stomach and/or the small bowel, colon, liver and spleen, to herniate through the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity; they are described in <a href="../B9780702077050000537/B9780702077050000537.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1042" id="pagebreak_1042"/><a id="pg1042"/></div></section><section><a id="s0095"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0055">Eventration</p><div class="textfl" id="p0135">Eventration is a focal bulge, usually located in the anteromedial segment of the muscular portion of the diaphragm.

Diaphragmatic paralysis can also be assessed by ultrasound examination, using an inhalation ‘sniff’ manoeuvre.</div><div class="text" id="p0265">The ‘gold standard’ for assessment of phrenic nerve and diaphragm function is electrical or magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerve with recording of the compound muscle action potential and/or the transdiaphragmatic pressure. Electrical stimulation of the diaphragm, by ‘pacing’ of one or both phrenic nerves, has been used with some success in infants with congenital central alveolar hypoventilatory syndrome (‘Ondine’s curse’) and in patients with high cervical lesions of the spinal cord, where the diaphragm is paralysed but the lower motor neurones are intact. Electrodes are placed adjacent to the nerves, sometimes in the neck but more usually in the chest, and a ventilatory rhythm is established by stimuli delivered by an implanted device. As this is a non-physiological way of recruiting the muscle, the fibres must be ‘conditioned’ during the initial period of stimulation, so that they acquire the necessary resistance to fatigue.</div></section><section><a id="s0210"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0150">Referred pain</p><div class="textfl" id="p0270">Diaphragmatic irritation or pain is frequently felt at the tip of the shoulder, reflecting the common spinal nerve root origins of the phrenic and supraclavicular nerves (the ventral rami of the third and fourth cervical spinal nerves).

The respiratory diaphragm is the main muscle of inspiration, responsible for approximately two-thirds of the volume of air intake during quiet breathing in healthy humans. Contraction of the external and internal intercostal muscles during inspiration and expiration varies with the superior-to-inferior position of an intercostal space and the position of the intercostal muscle within a given intercostal space. For example, the external intercostal muscles in the dorsal region of the more superiorly located intercostal spaces are mainly active during inspiration, whereas those in the ventral region of the more inferiorly located intercostal spaces are mainly active during expiration (<a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_10">De Troyer et al 2005</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0290">Increasing the vertical, transverse and anteroposterior dimensions of the thoracic cavity increases the volume of the pleural cavity: the resulting decrease in pressure within the pleural cavity creates a pressure gradient that draws air at atmospheric pressure into the lungs. During expiration, the diaphragm relaxes and is moved superiorly by the intra-abdominal viscera and increased intra-abdominal pressure produced by contraction of the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. Air is expelled from the lungs and the elastic recoil of the lung creates a subatmospheric pressure that returns the lateral and anteroposterior dimensions of the thorax to normal (<a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">De Troyer and Estenne 1988</a>, <a href="#bib76" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_76">Celli 1998</a>). During inspiration, the most inferior ribs are fixed and contraction of the diaphragm draws the central tendon inferiorly, minimally altering diaphragmatic curvature. The cupulae of the diaphragm move inferiorly and slightly anteriorly, almost parallel to their original positions. The associated inferior displacement of the abdominal viscera is permitted by the extensibility of the abdominal wall, but the limit of this extensibility is soon reached. The central tendon, its further motion prevented by the abdominal viscera, becomes a fixed point from which the fibres of the diaphragm continue to contract. This causes the second <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1045" id="pagebreak_1045"/><a id="pg1045"/>to tenth ribs to be elevated and the inferior portions of the ribs to be turned outwards as a result of direct transmission of pressure through the costal attachments of the diaphragm (zone of apposition) (<a href="#f0070"><span class="bold">Fig. 55.12</span></a>). During inspiration, the bodies of the ribs move superiorly and laterally, increasing the transverse dimensions of the thoracic cavity in the same manner as a bucket handle swinging outwards. This effect is most evident in the seventh to tenth ribs. Movements at the costovertebral joints cause elevation of the anterior ends of the ribs that push the body of the sternum and the upper ribs anteriorly in a ‘pump handle’ movement; this effect is most evident in second to sixth ribs, and increases the anteroposterior dimension of the thorax. The right cupula of the diaphragm, which lies over the liver, has a greater resistance to overcome than the left, which lies over the stomach; consequently the right crus and the muscle fibres of the right side of the diaphragm are more substantial than those of the left. The balance between descent of the diaphragm, protrusion of the abdominal wall <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1046" id="pagebreak_1046"/><a id="pg1046"/>(‘abdominal breathing’) and elevation of the ribs (‘thoracic breathing’) varies between individuals and with the phase and depth of ventilation, the degree of distension of the stomach and intestines, and the size of the liver. The thoracic element is usually more evident in females, but increases in both sexes during deep inspiration.</div><section><a id="sf0070"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0070"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000550/main.assets/on55-06-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0070"/><a id="fspara0075"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 55.12</span> Movements of the thoracic cage and respiratory diaphragm, and pressure changes within the thoracic and abdominal cavities during inspiration. <br/><span class="figcredit">With permission from Drake RL, Vogl AW, Mitchell AWN (eds) Gray’s Anatomy for Students, 3rd ed.

It is highest (most superior) when the body is supine, when it performs the greatest range of ventilatory movements with normal breathing. When the body is erect, the diaphragm is located at a more inferior level and its ventilatory movements become smaller; when sitting, the diaphragm is at its most inferior level and its ventilatory movements are at their smallest. When the body is horizontal and on one side (lateral decubitus), the two halves of the diaphragm are positioned and move differently. The uppermost half sinks to a lower level than that seen when sitting, and moves little with ventilation. The lower half rises to a higher level in the thoracic cavity than it does even in the supine position, and its ventilatory excursions are considerably greater (<a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Froese 2006</a>). Changes in the position of the diaphragm with alterations in posture explain why patients with severe dyspnoea are most comfortable, and least short of breath, when sitting with the trunk upright.</div><div class="text" id="p0300">In quiet breathing, the range of diaphragmatic excursion is about 1–2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm, increasing to 5–7<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm during deep breathing (<a href="#bib6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Boussuges et al 2009</a>, <a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Jung et al 2014</a>). Following a forced inspiration, e.g. when breathing is partially obstructed, the right cupula of the diaphragm may descend to approximately the level of the body of the eleventh thoracic vertebra, while the left cupula may reach the level of the body of the twelfth thoracic vertebra. After forced expiration, the right cupula of the diaphragm is level anteriorly with the fourth costal cartilage, laterally with the fifth, sixth and seventh ribs, and posteriorly with the eighth rib; the left cupula is normally located more inferiorly by about one intercostal space, rib or costal cartilage.</div><div class="text" id="p0305">The role of the abdominal wall in breathing is often underestimated. If the anterolateral abdominal wall connected the pelvic rim rigidly to the costal margins, inspiration would be impossible because the diaphragm could not descend (the abdominal contents would be incompressible), and the ribs could not rise (the connections to the pelvis would be inextensible). During normal breathing, the abdominal wall relaxes as the diaphragm contracts. It is possible to oppose this motion by tensing the abdomen, as in the ‘beach posture’ adopted to exaggerate the size of the chest. In this case, the abdominal contents fix the central tendon of the diaphragm, so that it raises the ribcage as it contracts, thus widening the gap between the ribs and the pelvic rim.</div><div class="text" id="p0310">The ventilatory muscles must also work during sleep, when the pharyngeal muscles relax and upper airway resistance increases. In some individuals, particularly those with obesity, this relaxation can lead to periodic apnoea and marked hypoxia during sleep, implying that the pharyngeal muscles play an important ventilatory role in waking life. Although ventilatory muscles rarely tire in normal life, they do fatigue when placed under abnormal loads, e.g. in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</div><div class="text" id="p0315">The different pulmonary regions do not all move equally during ventilation. In quiet ventilation, the juxtahilar part of the lung moves minimally, the middle region moves only slightly and the superficial costal regions of the lung expand the most. The mediastinal surface, posterior border and apex move less because they are related to less movable structures. The diaphragmatic and costomediastinal regions expand most of all. Most of the volumetric change during ventilation occurs in the alveoli.</div><div class="text" id="p0320">The primary role of the intercostal muscles is to stiffen the chest wall, preventing paradoxical motion during inspiratory diaphragmatic descent. This becomes most obvious immediately after high spinal cord injury, when there is flaccid paralysis of the entire trunk and only the diaphragm remains functional.</div><div class="text" id="p0325">In a healthy adult with a vital capacity of 4.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>L, approximately 3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>L is accounted for by diaphragmatic excursion. Immediately after high spinal cord injury, the vital capacity decreases to about 300<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>ml, even though the diaphragm is moving maximally, because the paradoxical incursion of the flaccid intercostal muscles results in a 2.7<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>L loss. After several weeks the paralysis usually becomes spastic, stiffening the chest wall, and the vital capacity increases towards its phrenic limit of about 3 litres. In the same way, high spinal cord injury reveals the role of the abdomen in inspiration and expiration. The abdominal musculature plays a major role in active expiration in humans. During the flaccid stage of high spinal cord paralysis, the only mechanisms available for returning the relaxed diaphragm into the thorax on expiration are passive recoil of the lungs and chest wall, and the weight of the abdominal viscera. The latter is the most important and operates only when an affected patient is lying down. If the patient is sat up or raised into an upright position, exhalation is impossible; trussing the abdomen with an elastic binder may be helpful. When the post injury paralysis becomes spastic, the stiff abdominal wall opposes inspiration.</div></section></section><footer><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1046.e2"
