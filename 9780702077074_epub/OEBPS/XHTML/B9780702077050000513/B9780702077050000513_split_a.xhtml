Each finger and the thumb have an osseo-aponeurotic tunnel that extends from the neck of the metacarpal to the distal phalanx. The proximal border is well defined, lying just beneath the distal palmar crease of the little, ring and middle fingers at the level of the neck of the metacarpal. The sheath consists of arcuate fibres that arch anteriorly over bone, tendons (where the sheath is required to be stiff) and the centres of joints (where a bucket-handle of arcuate fibres is a mechanically favourable arrangement). By contrast, where the sheath is required to fold to permit joint flexion, it consists of cruciate fibres. These fibrous sheaths are lined by a thin synovial membrane that provides a sealed lubrication system containing synovial fluid. The synovial membrane extends from the distal phalanx to mid-palm in the case of the index, middle and ring fingers, and further proximally in the case of the little finger (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_split_a.xhtml#f0120"><span class="bold">Fig. 51.27C</span></a>). The sheaths around the thumb and little finger are continuous with the flexor sheaths in front of the wrist. The parietal synovial membrane is reflected on to the surface of the flexor tendon, forming a visceral synovium.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0120"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000513/main.assets/f51-22-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0120"/><a id="fspara0120"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 51.27</span> Synovial sheaths of the tendons and fibrous flexor tendon sheaths on the flexor aspect of the left wrist and hand.

The usual pattern is as follows (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_split_a.xhtml#f0120"><span class="bold">Fig. 51.27A–B</span></a>). The A1 pulley is situated anterior to the palmar cartilaginous plate of the metacarpophalangeal joint and may extend over the proximal part of the proximal phalanx. The A2 overlies the middle third of the proximal phalanx. It is the strongest pulley and arises from well-defined longitudinal ridges on the palmar aspect of the phalanx. Its distal edge is well developed. A pouch or recess of synovium extends superficial to the free edge of the pulley fibres so that the free edge forms a lip protruding into the synovial space. A3 is a narrow pulley lying palmar to the proximal interphalangeal joint. A4 overlies the middle third of the middle phalanx, and A5 overlies the distal interphalangeal joint. The cruciate fibres are numbered in a slightly different manner. C0 is palmar to the metacarpophalangeal joint. There are two cruciate zones, C1 and C2, at the proximal interphalangeal joint, and they lie just proximal and distal, respectively, to A3. At the distal interphalangeal joint, there is one pronounced cruciate system, C3, which lies between A4 and A5. Variations occur frequently. During flexion, the cruciate fibres become orientated more transversely in the digits, and the edges of adjacent anular pulleys approximate so that they form, in full flexion, a continuous tunnel of transversely orientated fibres. Surgically, the most important pulleys that prevent bowstringing of the flexor tendons are the A2 and A4 pulleys.</div><div class="text" id="p1160">In the thumb, there are three constant pulleys: two anular and one oblique (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_split_a.xhtml#f0125"><span class="bold">Fig. 51.28</span></a>). The A1 pulley is located at the metacarpophalangeal joint. The oblique pulley is located over the mid-portion of the proximal phalanx and its fibres pass from the ulnar aspect proximally to the radial aspect dorsally. The A2 pulley is thinner than the A1 pulley and is situated just proximal to the interphalangeal joint. The oblique pulley is the most important pulley in the thumb for maintaining the action of flexor pollicis longus.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0125"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000513/main.assets/f51-23-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0125"/><a id="fspara0125"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 51.28</span> The flexor sheath of the left thumb, showing the anular and oblique pulleys. <br/><span class="figcredit">From Doyle JR, Blythe WF 1977 Anatomy of the flexor tendon sheath and pulleys of the thumb.

The sheath surrounding the tendons of the flexors digitorum reaches about halfway along the metacarpals, where it ends in blind diverticula around the tendons to the index, middle and ring fingers (see <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_split_a.xhtml#f0120">Fig. 51.27B</a>). The sheath is prolonged around the tendons to the little finger and is usually continuous with their digital synovial sheath. The sheath of flexor pollicis longus, which is usually separate, is continued along the thumb as far as the insertion of the tendon (see <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_split_a.xhtml#f0125">Fig. 51.28</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s1130"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0900">Vincula</h6><div class="textfl" id="p1170">The phenomenon of tendon gliding within a fibrous sheath requires a very specialized arrangement of the vascular supply.

Vincula brevia are attached to the deep surfaces of the tendons near to their insertions. There are two in each finger, one attaches flexor digitorum profundus to the region of the distal interphalangeal joint, and a more proximal vinculum lies deep to flexor digitorum superficialis at the proximal interphalangeal joint.

The opening of the fibrous flexor sheaths of the fingers thickens to form a distinct palpable, often tender, nodule in the palm beneath the distal transverse palmar crease. This inhibits the normal excursion of the flexor tendons, causing the finger to lock down into flexion at all three joints. The corresponding extensor muscle is insufficiently powerful to extend the affected finger, so the patient does this passively, accompanied by a painful snap. As time passes the proximal interphalangeal joint develops a contracture. Treatment frequently requires corticosteroid injection or surgical division of the A1 pulley of the flexor sheath to relieve the stricture.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s1145"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0910">Synovial sheaths of the carpal extensor tendons</h6><div class="textfl" id="p1185">Six tunnels deep to the extensor retinaculum transmit the extensor tendons, each containing a synovial sheath (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_split_a.xhtml#f0135"><span class="bold">Fig. 51.30</span></a>).

The floor of the sheath is formed by the insertion of brachioradialis. The tendons of extensors carpi radialis longus and brevis lie dorsomedial to the styloid process (compartment II); the tendon of extensor pollicis longus lies on the medial side of the dorsal (Lister’s) tubercle of the radius (compartment III); the tendons of extensors digitorum and indicis lie in a tunnel on the medial side of the tubercle (compartment IV); the tendon of extensor digiti minimi lies dorsal to the distal radio-ulnar joint (compartment V); the tendon of extensor carpi ulnaris lies between the head and the styloid process of the ulna in a narrow groove (compartment VI). The tendon sheaths of abductor pollicis longus, extensors pollicis brevis and longus, extensors carpi radialis longus and brevis and extensor carpi ulnaris stop immediately proximal to the bases of the metacarpals, while those of extensors digitorum, indicis and digiti minimi are sometimes prolonged a little more distally along the metacarpus. The sheaths of compartments I–V are separated by vertical pillars that connect the dorsum of the distal radius and the extensor retinaculum. Compartment VI (containing extensor carpi ulnaris) has a separate subsheath that is not in continuity with the extensor retinaculum, an arrangement that allows rotation of the distal radio-ulnar joint that would not otherwise be possible if the rigid retinaculum linked compartments V and VI.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0135"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000513/main.assets/f51-25-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0135"/><a id="fspara0135"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 51.30</span> A transverse section through the left wrist at the level of the distal row of the carpus, showing the muscle tendons (in grey) and their synovial sheaths (in green).<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="976" id="pagebreak_976"/></figcaption></figure></div><section><a id="s1150"/><section><a id="s1155"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0915">De Quervain’s tenovaginitis</p><div class="textfl" id="p1195">De Quervain’s tenovaginitis is a stenosing tenovaginosis of unknown aetiology that occurs in the first dorsal compartment at the level of the radial styloid.

There is palpable thickening of the tendon sheath with painful limitation of active extension and passive flexion of the thumb. Treatment may involve splinting, corticosteroid injection or surgery to divide the thickened sheath. The sheath is divided longitudinally along its dorsal attachment. This reduces the chance of ‘bowstringing’ of the abductor tendons on wrist flexion by retaining some pulley function. The surgeon must seek for a second and sometimes even third separate sheath within the first compartment.

These typically pass in a distal direction from middle finger to index finger, and from ring finger to middle and little fingers. Proximal lacerations to the middle finger extensor tendon may result in only partial loss of extension because of these tendinous interconnections. There is considerable variability in the arrangement of the extensors over the back of the hand. There are usually two tendons to the middle and ring fingers, whereas the tendon to the little finger may be absent and replaced with a junctura tendinum from the ring finger.</div><div class="text" id="p1205">At the level of the metacarpophalangeal joint, each extensor tendon is held in a central position over the dorsum of the joint by a flat, fibrous extensor expansion (see <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513.xhtml#f0110">Fig. 51.25</a>). The expansion extends on to the dorsum of the proximal phalanx of each digit, forming a movable hood that moves distally when the metacarpophalangeal joint is flexed, and proximally when it is extended. Each extensor tendon blends with the extensor expansion along its central axis and is separated from the metacarpophalangeal joint by a small bursa. The expansion is triangular in shape, with its base proximal. It receives the conjoined tendons of the interosseous and lumbrical muscles and is almost translucent between its margins and the tendon of extensor digitorum. Transverse fibres (the sagittal bands) pass to the volar plate and transverse metacarpal ligaments, separating the phalangeal attachment of the dorsal interosseous from the rest of the muscle, and the palmar interosseous from the lumbrical muscle. The margins of the extensor expansions are thickened on the radial side by the tendons of the lumbrical and interosseous muscles, and on the ulnar side either by the tendon of an interosseous alone or, in the case of the fifth digit, by abductor digiti minimi.</div><div class="text" id="p1210">The tendons of the interossei join the extensor expansion at the level of the proximal portion of the proximal phalanx, while the tendons of the lumbricals join the extensor mechanism further distally at the mid-portion of the proximal phalanx. Their line of pull is anterior to the axis of rotation at the metacarpophalangeal joint, but dorsal to the axis of rotation at the proximal interphalangeal joint. The extensor mechanism trifurcates into a central slip and two lateral bands just proximal to the proximal interphalangeal joint. The central slip receives a contribution from the tendons of the lumbricals and interossei via the lateral bands. Similarly, some fibres from the central region pass to each lateral band, producing a criss-cross arrangement of fibres. The central slip attaches to the base of the middle phalanx, while the lateral bands continue distally; they eventually fuse together and insert into the distal phalanx. The tension in the central slip and the lateral bands varies as the finger moves between flexion and extension and plays a crucial role in coordinating synchronous activity between the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints.</div><div class="text" id="p1215">The transverse and oblique retinacular ligaments of Landsmeer connect the fibrous flexor sheath to the extensor apparatus. The transverse retinacular ligament passes from the A3 pulley of the fibrous flexor sheath at the level of the proximal interphalangeal joint to the lateral border of the lateral extensor band. The oblique retinacular ligament lies deep to the transverse retinacular ligament. It originates from the lateral aspect of the proximal phalanx and flexor sheath (A2 pulley) and passes volar to the axis of rotation of the proximal interphalangeal joint, but in a dorsal and distal direction, to insert into the terminal extensor tendon.</div></section><section><a id="s1165"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0925">Sagittal band movement</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1220">See <span class="bold">Video 51.4</span>.</div></section><section><a id="s1170"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0930">Sagittal band injury</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1235">Injuries to the sagittal bands, from natural degeneration or a direct blow, can lead to subluxation of the extensor tendon. The radial sagittal band is usually affected. The tendon then passes anterior to the axis of the metacarpophalangeal joint, causing flexion and abduction of the proximal phalanx on the metacarpal. Secondary tightness of the opposite sagittal band and underlying collateral ligament promptly follows. Treatment involves immediate splinting to extend the metacarpophalangeal joint whilst keeping the proximal joint mobile. This reduces the sagittal band and allows healing. An alternative, particularly when there is secondary tightness of the opposite sagittal band, is surgical reconstruction.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s1175"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0935">Intrinsic muscles of the hand</h3><div class="textfl" id="p1240">The intrinsic muscles of the hand are organized into three groups plus a superficial muscle.

When the interossei are paralysed, the grip strength of the hand is reduced and the arc of finger motion is abnormal, with a tendency for the fingers to claw. Each interosseous also rotates the digit at the metacarpophalangeal joint.

Since both attachments are mobile, they have the potential for producing movement at either. The action on the extensor apparatus extends both interphalangeal joints in a coordinated manner. The mode of action at the metacarpophalangeal joints is disputed, but if there is a flexor action, it is weaker than that of the interossei. Because of the more distal insertion into the expansion, the lumbricals can still extend the interphalangeal joints with the metacarpophalangeal joints flexed, whereas the interossei cannot. The effect on the flexor digitorum profundus attachment is to pull the tendon distally. The combined action on both origin and insertion is, therefore, to weaken the tone of flexor digitorum profundus and augment the extension tone. Pinching the index finger against the thumb without a lumbrical would result in a nail-to-nail contact; the addition of the lumbrical increases the interphalangeal joint extension and results in pulp-to-pulp pinch. Lumbricals contain many muscle spindles and have a long fibre length and it is therefore reasonable to assume that they play a role in proprioception.</div><div class="text" id="p1475">The intrinsic muscles of the fingers, the interossei and lumbricals combined, have an important role in advancing metacarpophalangeal joint flexion yet inhibiting interphalangeal joint flexion when grip is initiated. This allows the fingers to form a hemisphere to hold an item such as a ball or a stick. In the absence of this accessory function, the long flexors would pull the interphalangeal joints into flexion too early which would hook the tips of the fingers and obstruct the space in front of the phalanges into which the ball would sit.</div></section><section><a id="s1555"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle1210">Testing</p><div class="textfl" id="p1480">Lumbricals cannot be tested in isolation but only as the lumbrical–interosseous muscle complex. The examiner asks the subject to hold the metacarpophalangeal joint of the finger in full flexion whilst fully extending the interphalangeal joints. An inability to do this causes the finger to assume a ‘clawed’ posture wherein the metacarpophalangeal joint extends and the interphalangeal joints flex. Tightness of the intrinsic muscles is assessed by the Bunnell test the metacarpophalangeal joint is held extended by the examiner and the proximal interphalangeal joint is passively flexed. An inability to flex the latter indicates that the intrinsic muscle is foreshortened.</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s1560"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle1215">Vascular supply to the intrinsic muscles of the hand</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1485">Flexor pollicis brevis is supplied by the superficial palmar branch of the radial artery, and branches from the princeps pollicis artery and radialis indicis artery.

Adductor pollicis, abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi brevis, opponens digiti minimi and all the interossei are innervated by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve; the first dorsal interosseous and adductor pollicis are supplied by its most distal portion. Palmaris brevis is innervated by the superficial branch of the ulnar nerve. The first and second lumbricals are innervated by the median nerve, and the third and fourth lumbricals by the deep terminal branch of the ulnar nerve. The third lumbrical frequently receives a supply from the median nerve. The first and second lumbricals are, occasionally, innervated by the deep terminal branch of the ulnar nerve.</div></section></section></section><a id="s1570"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle1225">Movements of the Hand</h2><div class="textfl" id="p1500">The apparently simple human functions of closing the hand to grasp an object, or opening the palm to release it, are, in reality, tasks of considerable mechanical complexity, requiring the simultaneous contraction of many individual muscles. The isolated action of a single muscle may be inferred from the positions of its origin and insertion, and the estimated line of action (usually, the centre line of the muscle) in relation to the axes of all the joints traversed by the muscle and its tendon. The limb can be regarded as a chain of joints crossed by muscles. If it is known which muscles are active, then the reason why one joint moves and others do not is a matter of simple mechanical relationships. For example, flexor pollicis longus is considered to have a major role as a flexor of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb. However, the position of its tendon relative to more proximal joints in the limb gives it the potential for producing flexion at the metacarpophalangeal joint and also at the trapeziometacarpal and wrist joints. In the living subject, the actual motion that takes place depends on which other muscle groups are acting as antagonists, and so the potential for movement must be considered for each joint in the chain in turn. Potential flexion at the wrist by flexor pollicis longus is generally balanced by wrist extensors and flexion at the trapeziometacarpal joint is balanced by abductor pollicis longus. Flexor pollicis longus will then have an action as a flexor of the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints only.</div><div class="text" id="p1505">The factor that determines whether one or both of two joints will move is the turning moment at each. The greater the perpendicular distance from the line of muscle or tendon pull to the axis of the joint, the stronger is the turning effect of the muscle at the joint, but the smaller the range of joint motion that can be produced. In the case of flexor pollicis longus, the tendon is situated further from the axis of the metacarpophalangeal joint than from the axis of the interphalangeal joint; it will, therefore, tend to produce flexion preferentially at the metacarpophalangeal joint, unless that joint is restrained by extensor pollicis brevis. In this way, different postures of the thumb can be produced by the interplay of flexor and extensor forces. These simple guiding principles should provide an understanding of muscle action in the hand that is sufficient for most purposes.</div><div class="text" id="p1510">In considering the role of a particular muscle, there is a tendency to concentrate on motion. Indeed, many muscles are named on the basis of the movements that they generate, although others, often those whose actions are the most difficult to interpret, are described according to their morphology or situation. A more important function may be the nature of the force generated. For example, although flexor pollicis longus flexes the thumb, a large range of flexion is actually required in only a few activities, such as grasping a narrow bar in the palm. In most pinch and manipulative tasks, the role of the thumb is to apply isometric force, which it does with such precision that it is possible to pick up an egg and neither crush nor drop it. Thus, for much of the time, flexor pollicis longus behaves as an extremely sophisticated mechanism for the application of force, in which contraction and proprioception are equally important.</div><div class="text" id="p1515">The anatomical position of the hand (palm flat and pointing anteriorly, forearm supinated) is a convenient standard for studying structural relationships. The hand in the relaxed (anaesthetized) position adopts a posture of partial flexion and mid-supination/pronation (the reader can verify this by relaxing completely and observing forearm and hand position).</div><section><a id="s1575"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle1230">Special functions of the hand</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle1235">Closing and opening the hand</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s1580"/></section></section><a id="s7558"/><section><a id="s9767"/><section><a id="s5432"/><section><a id="s1585"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle1240">Closing the hand</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1525">Whilst the fingers flex in gripping, grasping or making a fist, there are subtle differences in hand posture in these various activities. The basic mechanisms of hand closure will be described before special grips are considered.</div><div class="text" id="p1530">As the digits flex, the wrist usually extends (dorsiflexes) at the same time. The involvement of the long digital flexors in this movement will be considered first, followed by an analysis of the role of the wrist.</div><section><a id="s1590"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle1245">Role of the long digital flexors</h6><div class="textfl" id="p1535">Flexor digitorum superficialis acts principally to flex the proximal interphalangeal joints, through its insertions into the middle phalanges. However, in each digit, it also has an action on the metacarpophalangeal joint because the tendon passes anterior to that joint. The muscle has the potential to produce flexion at the wrist for the same reason. The fact that each tendon arises from an individual muscle slip allows the clinician to test one finger at a time. The reader can verify this by attempting to flex each digit individually while using the other hand to keep the distal interphalangeal joints of the remaining fingers in extension. This test is frequently used in clinical practice and is useful for the middle and ring fingers, where flexion of one finger alone must be attributed to flexor digitorum superficialis. The index finger, however, has its own profundus musculotendinous unit and may, therefore, move independently under the action of this tendon. Many individuals cannot flex the proximal interphalangeal joint of the little finger alone, usually because of linkage between the tendons of the ring and little finger flexor digitorum superficialis, but occasionally because superficialis is deficient. Most individuals can flex the metacarpophalangeal joint of the little finger using flexor digiti minimi.</div><div class="text" id="p1540">Flexor digitorum profundus is the only flexor of the distal interphalangeal joint. It also contributes, together with superficialis, to flexion at the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints. These two long flexors (sometimes called extrinsic flexors because the muscle bellies are outside the hand) can be considered to act together to flex the fingers.</div></section><section><a id="s1595"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle1250">Role of the intrinsic muscles of the hand</h6><div class="textfl" id="p1545">The action of the long flexors alone would wind up the interphalangeal joints before the metacarpophalangeal joints, and the fingers would not move in a normal arc of flexion. This is precisely what happens in an ulnar nerve paralysis, in which the interossei and lumbricals are not functioning. These small (intrinsic) muscles have been described earlier in terms of their individual actions. For their role in coordinated activity, it is sufficient to appreciate that their contribution changes the arc produced by the long flexors, increasing flexion at the metacarpophalangeal joint and reducing flexion at the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. All three joints are then angulated to the same degree and the fingers form a normal arc of flexion. As the finger flexes, the long extensor tendons (extensor digitorum, extensor indicis and extensor digiti minimi) aid the process by relaxing and allowing the extensor apparatus to glide distally on the dorsum of the phalanges.</div></section><section><a id="s1600"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle1255">Role of the wrist</h6><div class="textfl" id="p1550">As the fingers wind up to make a fist, the wrist tends to extend, particularly when force is applied. This extension has a marked effect on the excursion of the long flexor tendons. On its own, digital flexion requires the long tendons to move proximally in their sheaths and the flexor muscles in the forearm would shorten. The maximum excursion possible in flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus is approximately 7<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm. Extension of the wrist tends to produce a lengthening of these muscles, which, in normal use, is almost enough to balance the shortening due to finger flexion; the net effect is a very slight shortening (approximately 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm) of the long flexors in the forearm. The wrist can, therefore, be seen as a mechanism for maximizing force because it allows the fingers to flex while maintaining the resting length of the extrinsic muscles near to the peak of the force–length curve. It is, of course, possible to wind up the fingers with the wrist held in a neutral position but the grip is somewhat weaker. With the wrist in full flexion, it is not possible to flex the fingers fully as there is insufficient excursion of the muscle unit.</div><div class="text" id="p1555">Flexion of the fingers on gripping tends to result in a distal excursion of the long extensors. However, this tendency is counteracted by dorsiflexion of the wrist. The net effect is a very small proximal excursion of the long extensor tendons on gripping, mirroring the effect on the flexor surface. If the movement of the wrist is exaggerated so that the wrist is a little flexed on opening the hand, and fully dorsiflexed on closing it, the net excursion of long flexors and extensors is zero, i.e. this whole movement sequence can be completed with the forearm flexor and extensor muscles contracting isometrically.</div><div class="text" id="p1560">The reader can observe the relationship between digits and wrist by performing the following manoeuvre. The wrist is held in a relaxed, mid-supinated position, with the elbow flexed at 90°. If the forearm is now rotated into pronation, the wrist will fall into flexion and the fingers will automatically extend. If the forearm is rotated into supination, the wrist will extend and the fingers flex. The finger movements compensate for the wrist movements and are entirely automatic; they are made without the need for any excursion of forearm flexor or extensor tendons. This test, the wrist tenodesis test, is a useful way of examining the limb for tendon injury. The pointing finger (which does not move with wrist motion) ‘points to’ a tendon injury.</div></section><section><a id="s1605"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle1260">Making a tight fist</h6><div class="textfl" id="p1565">It is possible to observe and to palpate the muscle groups that are active in making a tight fist. Flexor digitorum profundus and flexor digitorum superficialis are active, and flexor carpi ulnaris contracts strongly, as do the wrist extensors. Palpation of the long digital extensors on the dorsum of the wrist, the first dorsal interosseous in the thumb web, and of the other interossei and the thenar and hypothenar muscles, will confirm that all these muscles are contracting. As a firm fist is swung forwards in anger, brachioradialis stands out; at the moment of impact, virtually every muscle in the limb is active.</div></section><section><a id="s1610"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle1265">Role of the arches of the hand</h6><div class="textfl" id="p1570">The hand has <span class="italic">stable</span> elements and <span class="italic">mobile</span> elements (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib87" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_87">Tubiana et al 1996</a>). The distal row of the carpus together with the second and third carpometacarpal joints are stable and rigid. The fourth and especially the fifth carpometacarpal joints, the thumb ray and the phalangeal joints are mobile. This allows the hand to form adaptable arches on gripping. The transverse carpal arch, formed by the carpal bones, is rigid. The metacarpal arch, between the metacarpal heads of the index and little finger, allows the ulnar side of the palm to curve into supination, by movement at the fourth and fifth carpometacarpal joints. The longitudinal arch, along the axis of a metacarpal and its phalanges, allows the finger to flex around an object. The thumb forms two important oblique arches, one between the tip of the thumb through the thumb–index web to the pulp of the index finger, the other from the pulp of the thumb, along the thumb ray, across the palm and along the front of the little finger to its pulp. As the fingers flex into the palm, the combined alignment and mobility of the involved joint surfaces bring all the finger tips to a focal point over the scaphoid tubercle. This also increases the security of grip of small items such as a golf ball.</div></section></section><section><a id="s1615"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle1270">Opening the hand</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1575">The hand is opened from its relaxed balanced posture, e.g. when stretching out to reach an object. This motion is made up of extension of the distal interphalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints together with retroposition and extension of the thumb. As the fingers extend they tend to abduct and rotate outwards from the axis of the middle finger. The hand is provided with an ingenious mechanism that allows this to happen. The laws of mechanics would suggest that one motor would be required for every joint in a chain, together with some sort of controlling mechanism to ensure that the chain of joints moved together in a coordinated fashion. In the hand, this is achieved through an extensor apparatus that minimizes the number of motors required for movement by allowing the muscles to act on more than one joint, and by linking different levels in the mechanism so that the arc of motion is controlled.</div><div class="text" id="p1580">The tendons of extensor digitorum run distally over the metacarpal heads, forming the major component of the extensor apparatus. Extensor digitorum has no insertion into the proximal phalanx and, therefore, exerts its extensor action on the metacarpophalangeal joint indirectly through more distal insertions. The first point of insertion is at the base of the middle phalanx (known as the ‘central slip’). Acting at this insertion alone, extensor digitorum can extend both metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints together. The interossei are also active in hand opening, since they extend both the proximal and interphalangeal joints through the lateral bands. There is, therefore, a range of possibilities. At one extreme, with no contribution from the interossei, the long extensor will exert all of its action at the metacarpophalangeal joint; this leads to full extension, and even hyperextension, while the proximal interphalangeal joint remains flexed (the typical ‘intrinsic minus’, or claw hand, of ulnar nerve paralysis). At the other extreme, when the intrinsics act strongly together with extensor digitorum, the proximal interphalangeal joint will extend completely while the metacarpophalangeal joint remains flexed (‘intrinsic plus’ hand). Thus, the hand possesses, in the proximal part of the extensor apparatus, a variable mechanism that allows different amounts of relative metacarpophalangeal or proximal interphalangeal joint motion.</div><div class="text" id="p1585">In contrast, the more distal part of the extensor apparatus acts as an automatic or fixed mechanism that determines that the two interphalangeal joints, proximal and distal, will move together. The lateral slips of the extensor apparatus arise from extensor digitorum and pass distally on either side of the central slip and thus over the proximal interphalangeal joint; being further lateral, they are nearer the joint axis because the dorsal surface curves away on each side. A helpful analogy that has been suggested for this arrangement is to consider it as two pulleys of different size on one axle. The central slip can be regarded as a cord that passes over the larger wheel, and each lateral slip as a cord that passes over the smaller wheel. Since these latter pulleys are smaller, there is less longitudinal excursion for a given rotation of the wheel, and this allows some of the excursion to be used for another function, namely: extension at the distal joint. There is an additional mechanism by which the lateral slips move laterally during flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joint. The effect of this lateral movement is to reduce further the distance between the lateral slips and the joint axis, thereby reducing the amount of excursion at the proximal interphalangeal joint still more and allowing more excursion at the distal joint. When the hand flexes, this mechanical linkage system allows both interphalangeal joints to flex together in a coordinated way.</div><div class="text" id="p1590">The extensor expansion also receives contributions from the interossei and lumbricals, which approach the digits from the webs and join the corresponding expansion in the proximal segment of the digit. These muscles can, therefore, act on the extensor apparatus at two levels: they can extend the proximal interphalangeal joint through fibres that radiate towards the central slip, and they can act on the distal interphalangeal joint through fibres that join the lateral slip.</div><div class="text" id="p1595">The oblique retinacular ligament also passively aids synchronized extension by linking the terminal extensor fibres at the level of the distal interphalangeal joint with the flexor sheath just proximal to the proximal interphalangeal joint. This tightens with extension of the proximal interphalangeal joint causing obligatory passive extension of the distal interphalangeal joint. The presence of this structure can be confirmed by noting the marked resistance when passively flexing the distal joint with the proximal interphalangeal joint held passively extended, which resistance disappears if the proximal joint is flexed.</div><div class="text" id="p1600">Apart from the components of the extensor expansion that are concerned with joint function, the whole structure requires additional anchorage (see <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513.xhtml#f0110">Fig. 51.25</a>). The transversely lying triangular ligament just distal to the insertion of the central slip prevents the lateral bands from subluxating too far outwards and palmarwards when the proximal interphalangeal joint flexes. Following a central slip rupture, this triangular ligament becomes attenuated, causing the lateral bands to slide outward and forwards until they pass anterior to the axis of the joint acting as flexor and causing the boutonnière deformity.</div><div class="text" id="p1605">As the expansion glides backwards and forwards, the transverse fibres move like bucket handles. Smooth gliding layers are required under the expansion and retinacular ligaments to allow motion to occur without friction.</div></section></section></section><a id="s5120"/><section><a id="s4220"/><section><a id="s4920"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle1275">Movements of the thumb</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1615">See <span class="bold">Video 51.6</span> .</div><div class="text" id="p1625">The thumb does not easily assume the classical anatomical position. Therefore, the normal descriptive anatomical terms, i.e. anterior, posterior, medial and lateral, do not readily apply. The terms ‘palmar’, ‘dorsal’, ‘ulnar’ and ‘radial’ have been adopted in clinical practice.</div><div class="text" id="p1630">An opposable thumb requires a different system of control from the other digits. Since the metacarpal is much more mobile than in the digits, muscles are needed to control the extra freedom of movement. The basic active movements are flexion–extension, abduction–adduction, rotation and circumduction. In the resting position of the first metacarpal, flexion and extension are parallel with the palmar plane, and abduction and adduction occur at right-angles to this.</div><div class="text" id="p1635">Flexion and extension should be confined to motion at the interphalangeal or metacarpophalangeal joints). Palmar abduction (in which the first metacarpal moves away from the second at right-angles to the plane of the palm, and radial abduction in which the first metacarpal moves away from the second with the thumb in the plane of the palm, occur at the carpometacarpal joint. The opposite of radial abduction is ulnar adduction, or transpalmar adduction, in which the thumb crosses the palm towards its ulnar border. In clinical practice, the term adduction is generally used without qualification. Circumduction describes the angular motion of the first metacarpal, solely at the carpometacarpal joint, from a position of maximal radial abduction in the plane of the palm towards the ulnar border of the hand, maintaining the widest possible angle between the first and second metacarpals. Lateral inclinations of the first phalanx maximize the extent of excursion of the circumduction arc. Opposition is a composite position of the thumb (achieved by palmar abduction, flexion and pronation of the first metacarpal, with slight radial deviation and flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joint and slight flexion of the interphalangeal joint) such that the pulp of the thumb opposes the pulp of a digit with the nail of the thumb parallel to the palm (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Bunnell 1938</a>). Retroposition restores the hand from opposition, lifting the thumb backwards from the plane of the palm.</div><div class="text" id="p1640">Rotary movements occur during circumduction. The simple angular movements described above combine with rotation about the long axis of the metacarpal shaft. In opposition, the shaft must rotate medially into pronation. In retroposition, the thumb must rotate laterally into supination. Axial rotation of the thumb metacarpal is produced by muscle activity (which moves the thumb through its arc of circumduction); the geometry of the articular surfaces of the trapeziometacarpal joint; and tensile forces in the ligaments (which combine with forces exerted by the muscles of opposition and retroposition to produce axial rotation). The stability of the first metacarpal is greatest after complete pronation in the position of full opposition, when the tension in the ligaments, muscular contraction and joint congruence combine to maximal effect.</div></section></section><a id="s4625"/><section><a id="s3625"/><section><a id="s2625"/><section><a id="s1625"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle1280">Position of rest</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1645">The hand has a well-recognized position of rest, with the wrist in extension and the digits in some degree of flexion.

It appears, however, that even a monoarticular muscle can change posture in all three joints by altering the overall balance of forces and it is, therefore, very difficult to attribute function to the individual intrinsic muscles. However, the thumb muscles do seem to provide two broad functions.

These forces act simultaneously but with different intensities, depending on the situation of the thumb.

The proximal phalanx is stabilized from translating dorsally in pinch by the volar plate and by the extensor hood (which is actively contracted by the adductor pollicis and flexor pollicis brevis). The abductor pollicis longus also contracts firmly, locking the base of the metacarpal into a stable position of abduction and compression against the trapezium.

Flexion–adduction deformity of the thumb reflects an imbalance between its intrinsic and extrinsic musculature – principally powered by adductor pollicis, the first dorsal interosseous, flexor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis brevis – which produces flexion, adduction and lateral rotation of the carpometacarpal joint, flexion and lateral rotation of the metacarpophalangeal joint and flexion of the interphalangeal joint. In an attempt to counteract this, the patient tends to hold the wrist in extreme flexion and ulnar deviation (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib59" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_59">Matev 1963</a>).

The metacarpophalangeal joints have no primary flexor but retain the powerful extensor digitorum. Extensor digitorum relies on a single muscle belly to extend the metacarpophalangeal joints and the proximal and the distal interphalangeal joints. In order to permit interphalangeal joint flexion with metacarpophalangeal joint extension (hook grip) there needs to be some ‘slack’ in the tendons distal to the metacarpophalangeal joints when extensor digitorum is contracted: the intrinsic muscles are responsible for trimming this slack in order to extend the interphalangeal joints fully. Absence of the intrinsic muscles results in four main disabilities: the fingers cannot be extended fully at the interphalangeal joints; abduction and adduction of the digits are lost; when grasping an object, flexion begins at the terminal joints, closing the fingers on themselves rather than on the palm; and the effective part of the finger becomes the tip and nail rather than the pulp (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Brand 1958</a>).</div></section></section><a id="s1655"/><hgroup><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle1310">Vascular Supply</h2><h3 class="h2after1" id="cesectitle1315">Arteries</h3></hgroup><section><a id="s1660"/><div class="textfl" id="p1715">Anastomoses occur between the radial and ulnar arteries at the wrist (via the palmar and dorsal carpal arches) and in the hand (via the superficial and deep palmar arches), and between their digital and metacarpal branches (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_split_a.xhtml#f0195"><span class="bold">Figs 51.35</span></a><span class="bold">,</span> <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_split_a.xhtml#f0160"><span class="bold">51.36</span></a>) (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib96" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_96">Wong and Higgins 2015</a>).</div><div id="p1720"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0195"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000513/main.assets/on51-07ag-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000513/main.assets/on51-07hk-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0195"/><a id="cap6195"/><a id="fspara0200"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 51.35</span> A digital subtraction macroangiogram of the hand.

They pass distally on the second to fourth lumbricals, each joined by a corresponding palmar metacarpal artery from the deep palmar arch, and divide into two proper palmar digital arteries. These run along the contiguous sides of all four fingers, dorsal to the digital nerves, between Grayson’s and Cleland’s ligaments, anastomosing in the subcutaneous tissue of the fingertips and near the interphalangeal joints. Each digital artery has two dorsal branches that anastomose with the dorsal digital arteries and supply the soft parts dorsal to the middle and distal phalanges, including the matrices of the nails (see <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513.xhtml#f0170">Fig. 51.2B</a>).

Three distal phalangeal dorsal arterial arcades anastomose with each other and with those from the other side of the digit. The superficial arcade occurs at the level of the proximal nail fold and is supplied primarily by a dorsal branch from the palmar digital artery, which is given off at the level of the middle phalanx. The proximal subungual arcade is at the level of the lunula and is supplied by a terminal branch of the digital artery, which passes dorsally. The distal subungual arcade occurs more distally in the nail bed. It is supplied by a dorsal vessel that emerges from the point of confluence of the ‘H’-shaped anastomosis between the terminal portions of both digital arteries, and passes from volar to dorsal aspect of the digit under the interosseous ligament connecting the proximal and distal parts of the distal phalanx.</div></section><section><a id="s1805"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle1415">Variations</p><div class="textfl" id="p1830">The ulnar and radial arteries to the hand may occasionally be supplemented by a median artery that contributes to, or supplies, the superficial palmar arch and by the anterior interosseous artery, which may make a contribution to the deep palmar arch.

The antebrachial type is slender and short, usually arising from the anterior interosseous artery and finishing in the forearm.

It often divides first into a lateral ramus, providing digital branches to the thumb and the radial side of the index finger, and a medial ramus, supplying digital branches to adjacent sides of the index, middle and ring fingers. Other modes of termination can occur.</div><div class="text" id="p1885">Digital branches are commonly arranged as follows. They pass distally, deep to the superficial palmar arch and its digital vessels, at first anterior to the tendons of the long flexors. Two proper palmar digital nerves, sometimes from a common stem, pass to the sides of the thumb; the nerve supplying its radial side crosses in front of the tendon of flexor pollicis longus. The proper palmar digital nerve to the lateral side of the index finger also supplies the first lumbrical. Two common palmar digital nerves pass distally between the tendons of the long flexors. The lateral divides in the distal palm into two proper palmar digital nerves that traverse adjacent sides of the index and middle finger. The medial divides into two proper palmar digital nerves that supply adjacent sides of the middle and ring fingers. The lateral common digital nerve supplies the second lumbrical, and the medial receives a communicating twig from the common palmar digital branch of the ulnar nerve and may supply the third lumbrical. In the distal part of the palm, the digital arteries pass deeply between the divisions of the digital nerves; the nerves lie anterior to the arteries on the sides of the digits. The median nerve usually supplies palmar cutaneous digital branches to the radial three and a half digits (thumb, index, middle and the lateral side of the ring); sometimes, the radial side of the ring finger is supplied by the ulnar nerve. Occasionally, there is a communicating branch between the common digital nerve to the middle and ring fingers (derived from the median nerve) and the common digital nerve to the ring and little fingers (derived from the ulnar nerve); this may explain variations in sensory patterns that do not conform to the classic pattern.</div><div class="text" id="p1890">The proper palmar digital nerves pass along the medial side of the index finger and both sides of the middle and the lateral side of the ring finger. They enter these digits in fat between slips of the palmar aponeurosis. Together with the lumbricals and palmar digital arteries, they pass dorsal to the superficial transverse metacarpal ligament and ventral to the deep transverse metacarpal ligament. In the digits, the nerves run distally beside the long flexor tendons (outside their fibrous sheaths), level with the anterior phalangeal surfaces and anterior to the digital arteries, between Grayson’s and Cleland’s ligaments. Each nerve gives off several branches to the skin on the front and sides of the digit and sends branches to the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints.</div><div class="text" id="p1895">The digital nerves supply the fibrous sheaths of the long flexor tendons, blood vessels (vasomotor) and sweat glands (sudomotor). Distal to the base of the distal phalanx, each digital nerve gives off a branch that passes dorsally to the nail bed (see <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513.xhtml#f0045">Fig. 51.9</a>). The main nerve frequently trifurcates to supply the pulp and skin of the terminal part of the digit. Distal to the base of the proximal phalanx, each proper digital nerve also gives off a dorsal branch to supply the skin over the back of the middle and distal phalanges. The proper palmar digital nerves to the thumb and the lateral side of the index finger emerge with the tendons of the long flexors from under the lateral edge of the palmar aponeurosis. They are arranged in the digits as described above, except that, in the thumb, small distal branches supply the skin on the back of the distal phalanx only.</div></section><section><a id="s1910"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle1485">Other branches</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1900">In addition to the branches of the median nerve described above, variable vasomotor branches supply the radial and ulnar arteries and their branches. Some of the intercarpal, carpometacarpal and intermetacarpal joints are said to be supplied by the median nerve or its anterior interosseous branch; the precise details are uncertain.</div></section><section><a id="s1915"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle1490">Carpal tunnel syndrome</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1905">Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common entrapment mononeuropathy. It is caused by compression of the median nerve as it passes through the fibro-osseous tunnel beneath the flexor retinaculum (see <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_split_a.xhtml#f0200">Fig. 51.38</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1915">Carpal tunnel syndrome is usually idiopathic, however, certain diagnoses may predispose to the condition. The carpal tunnel may be narrowed by arthritic changes in the wrist joint, by thickening of the synovium (especially in rheumatoid disease), by soft tissue thickening, as may occur in myxoedema and acromegaly; it is associated with diabetes, oedema, obesity, pregnancy and vibration. The association with repetitive use and computing is controversial and has probably been overestimated. Normally, the median nerve slides smoothly in and out of the carpal tunnel during flexion and extension of the wrist, but when the nerve is compressed this sliding is restricted by traction which <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="984" id="pagebreak_984"/><a id="pg984"/>aggravates the conduction block. Typically, the syndrome produces painful paraesthesia and numbness in the thumb, index, middle and medial side of the ring fingers, which is worse at night and on manoeuvres such as holding a book or telephone. The palmar branch of the median nerve is spared because it does not pass through the carpal tunnel. With time, the compression leads to wasting and weakness of abductor pollicis brevis and loss of sweating in the cutaneous territory of the median nerve, sparing the patch overlying the scaphoid tubercle and palmar side of the carpometacarpal joint which is supplied by the palmar cutaneous nerve. Treatment depends on the cause. If present just at night, due to involuntary flexion of the wrist (which increase pressure in the carpal canal) then a splint may suffice. If the syndrome is of recent onset, especially in association with pregnancy or synovial thickening, then a steroid injection can be curative. For more persistent symptoms, and especially if there is evidence of axonal failure (numbness, loss of sweating, wasting of abductor pollicis brevis) then surgery is recommended. This involves dividing the flexor retinaculum (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_split_a.xhtml#f0200"><span class="bold">Fig. 51.38</span></a>). The most common hazards of decompression are inadequate decompression because of failure to divide the most distal or most proximal part of the flexor retinaculum, damage to the motor branch causing weakness, or palmar cutaneous branch or one or more terminal sensory branches causing scar tenderness and a patch of numbness and damage to the superficial palmar arch causing a haematoma.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0200"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000513/main.assets/f51-32-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap9165"/><a id="fspara8165"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 51.38</span> Carpal tunnel syndrome, left wrist, flexor aspect: the flexor retinaculum has been divided, exposing the median nerve. <br/><span class="figcredit">Copyright Martin Langer.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p1920">Anatomical anomalies of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel are very common (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_41">Henry et al 2015</a>) and occur in up to 12% of hands.

The symptoms depend on the precise level at which the ulnar nerve and its branches are compressed. Altered sensation is noted in the palmar aspect of the little and ulnar half of the ring fingers; sensation on the ulnar aspect of the dorsum of the hand is normal due to preservation of the dorsal cutaneous branch. If the motor branch fibres are affected, there is weakness and wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hand supplied by the ulnar nerve, with clawing posture in severe compression. Weakness of adductor pollicis and the first dorsal interosseous substantially degrades pinch strength: if a slip of paper is held in the key pinch position between the pulp of the thumb and the radial side of the index proximal interphalangeal joint, the tip of the thumb involuntarily flexes as flexor pollicis longus contracts to compensate for the absent adductor pollicis and first dorsal interosseous (Froment’s sign).</div><div class="text" id="p1975">Surgical treatment involves decompression of the nerve by division of the roof of Guyon’s canal and removal of any causative lesion, such as a ganglion.

However, the superficial terminal branch of the radial nerve may supply the whole dorsum of the hand.</div></section></section></section><a id="s1970"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle1545">Surface Anatomy of the Wrist And Hand</h2><div class="textfl" id="p2015">See <span class="bold">Video 51.8</span> and <span class="bold">Video 51.9</span>.</div><section><a id="s1975"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle1550">Flexor/volar surface</h3><div class="textfl" id="p2035">The wrist joint is identified between the distal ends of the radius and ulna, and the proximal row of the carpus, on flexion and extension of the wrist. The line of the wrist joint corresponds to a line, convex superiorly, joining the radial and ulnar styloid processes. Its position is also marked by the proximal of the two transverse anterior wrist creases (see <a href="../B9780702077050000483/B9780702077050000483.xhtml#f0290">Fig. 48.54A</a>). The radial styloid process normally sits 1 cm distal to the ulnar styloid process.</div><div class="text" id="p2040">When the forearm is pronated, the head of the ulna forms a rounded surface elevation on the medial side of the posterior aspect of the wrist (see <a href="../B9780702077050000483/B9780702077050000483.xhtml#f0285">Figs 48.53C</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000483/B9780702077050000483.xhtml#f0290">Fig. 48.54B</a>), and the ulnar styloid process projects distally from its posteromedial aspect. The radial styloid process projects inferiorly from the distal radius along the lateral aspect of the wrist. The posterior aspect of the lower end of the radius is partly obscured by the extensor tendons but is palpable. The prominent dorsal radial (Lister’s) tubercle is both visible and palpable, and aligns with the web space between digits 2 and 3. The tendon of extensor pollicis longus in extensor compartment 3 sits medial to the tubercle, and the tendons of extensors carpi radialis longus and brevis sit lateral to the tubercle in compartment 2.</div><div class="text" id="p2045">Four of the carpal bones are palpable. The pisiform is both visible and palpable on the palmar aspect of the medial wrist at the base of the hypothenar eminence. It is often overlain by the distal wrist crease. It can be moved over the articular surface of the triquetrum when the wrist is passively flexed. The hook of the hamate lies approximately 2.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm distal to the pisiform, in line with the ulnar border of the ring finger. It can be felt on deep palpation, and the superficial division of the ulnar nerve can be rolled from side to side over the tip of the hook. The tubercle of the scaphoid is situated at the base of the thenar eminence, in line with the tendon of flexor carpi radialis and, in many individuals, forms a small, visible elevation. Immediately distal to it, but covered by the muscles of the thenar eminence, the tubercle of the trapezium can be identified on deep palpation.</div><div class="text" id="p2050">Proximal to the wrist creases, the prominent tendon of flexor carpi radialis can be seen and palpated when the wrist is flexed against resistance (see <a href="../B9780702077050000483/B9780702077050000483.xhtml#f0290">Fig. 48.54A</a>). The radial artery lies on its lateral side and crosses the anterior margin of the expanded distal end of the radius, where it is palpable. It then passes posteriorly, deep to the tendons of abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis, and enters the anatomical snuff-box, where its pulsations are palpable (see <a href="../B9780702077050000483/B9780702077050000483.xhtml#f0290">Fig. 48.54C</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p2055">Palpation lateral to flexor carpi radialis, 5–6<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm proximal to the wrist crease, reveals the muscle belly of flexor pollicis longus (flexing and extending the thumb will confirm that the examining finger is correctly placed). The area on the medial (ulnar) side of flexor carpi radialis tendon is packed with functionally important structures. The median nerve is either covered by, or situated just radial to, the tendon of palmaris longus. The latter can be identified by gently pinching the tips of the digits together and partially flexing the wrist (see <a href="../B9780702077050000483/B9780702077050000483.xhtml#f0290">Fig. 48.54A</a>). Near to the wrist, the median nerve lies very close to the skin and can, therefore, be injured by relatively superficial lacerations. When palmaris longus is absent, only a thin covering of subcutaneous fat and deep fascia separate skin and nerve. The four tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis lie deep to the median nerve; the tendons to the middle and ring fingers lie anterior to those for the index and little fingers as they pass deep to the flexor retinaculum, and can be felt and usually seen to move during finger flexion/extension. Deeper still are the tendons of flexor digitorum profundus. The broad tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris is easily palpated passing to the pisiform on the ulnar side of the anterior wrist; the ulnar nerve, artery and venae comitantes lie along its lateral (radial) edge. Any sharp injury that cuts through the tendon usually has enough energy to sever the ulnar neurovascular bundle.</div></section><section><a id="s1980"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle1555">Anatomical snuff-box</h3><div class="textfl" id="p2065">When the thumb is fully extended, the depression of the anatomical snuff-box is seen on the lateral aspect of the wrist immediately distal to the radial styloid process. The snuff-box is bounded on its anterolateral (radial) side by the tendons of abductor pollicis longus (laterally) and extensor pollicis brevis (immediately dorsomedial), and on its posteromedial/ulnar side by the tendon of extensor pollicis longus. Running a finger along extensor pollicis brevis enables palpation of the superficial radial nerve, which can be rolled from side to side on the tendon. The cephalic vein passes through the roof of the snuff-box, where it is visible and palpable, and the pulsation of the radial artery can be palpated deeply on its floor. Three bones are palpable distal to the radial styloid process along the floor of the anatomical snuff-box: the convex, ovoid proximal articular surface of the scaphoid (best palpated during alternating wrist abduction/adduction), the radial aspect of the trapezium and the expanded base of the first metacarpal. The first carpometacarpal joint forms a palpable depression distal to the trapezium.</div></section><section><a id="s1985"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle1560">Extensor/dorsal surface</h3><div class="textfl" id="p2075">The tendons located within the six extensor compartments of the wrist are subcutaneous and palpable (see <a href="../B9780702077050000483/B9780702077050000483.xhtml#f0290">Fig. 48.54B</a>). Compartment I (containing abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis) sits over the lateral radius. Regional tenderness to palpation occurs in de Quervain’s tenosynovitis. Compartment II is bounded laterally by the radial styloid and medially by Lister’s tubercle. The tendons of extensors carpi radialis longus and brevis in this compartment can be identified on the dorso-radial carpus when the fist is clenched and relaxed. Compartment III (containing extensor pollicis longus) is palpable to the medial side of Lister’s tubercle: the tendon of extensor pollicis longus is palpable if the thumb pulp is actively retroposed behind the plane of the palm. Compartment IV (containing extensors digitorum and indicis) sits between the ulnar head and compartment III: the tendons of extensor digitorum are visible and palpable on the dorsum of the hand with the fingers fully extended. Compartment V (containing extensor digiti minimi) overlies the distal radio-ulnar joint. Compartment VI (containing extensor carpi ulnaris) overlies the dorso-ulnar corner of the ulnar head: the tendon of extensor carpi ulnaris is palpable distal to the ulnar styloid as it crosses the wrist, with the wrist in resisted extension and supination or pronation and adduction. The first dorsal interosseous forms a visible fleshy mass on the lateral part of the dorsal hand between the index finger and thumb, especially whilst abducting the index finger against resistance.</div></section><section><a id="s1990"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle1565">Hand</h3><div class="textfl" id="p2085">The palmar skin is marked by a number of creases but they are of little value as points of reference (see <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 51.1</a>). Transverse skin creases cross the palmar aspect of the fingers in three places: the most proximal crease sits at the junction of the digit with the palm and lies approximately 2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm distal to the metacarpophalangeal joint; the intermediate crease sits opposite the proximal interphalangeal joint; and the distal crease sits just proximal to the distal interphalangeal joint.</div><div class="text" id="p2090">The first metacarpal is both visible and palpable on the dorsolateral hand; its dorsal aspect forms the lateral border of the hand. The fleshy elevation of the thenar eminence, produced by abductor and flexor pollicis brevis overlying opponens pollicis, is located on the lateral palm. The less prominent hypothenar eminence is located on the medial palm and is formed by the comparable muscles of the little finger. The medial aspect of the hypothenar eminence forms the medial border of the hand.</div><div class="text" id="p2095">The dorsal aspects of the trapezium and of each of the metacarpals are partially palpable around the margins of the corresponding extensor tendons. The heads of the metacarpals form the prominences of the knuckles and are most obvious during digit flexion. On the dorsal hand, the metacarpophalangeal joint line forms a palpable depression either side of the digital extensor tendon: alternating digit flexion/extension aids identification. The joint can be aspirated/injected from this perspective. Palpation distal to the metacarpal head reveals the flared base of the corresponding proximal phalanx. The interphalangeal joints are palpable on the dorsal aspect of a flexed digit just distal to the prominences formed by the heads of the proximal and middle phalanges.</div><div class="text" id="p2100">The flexor retinaculum, and therefore the surface position of the carpal tunnel, can be mapped according to its palpable bony attachments. Its distal border is concave inferiorly and is marked by a curved line that joins the tubercle of the trapezium to the hook of the hamate. Its proximal border is marked by a curved line, concave superiorly, which joins the tubercle of the scaphoid to the pisiform. Flexion of the wrist produces a number of transverse skin creases (usually two, sometimes three) at the wrist. The dominant, most distal, wrist crease normally sits distal to the lunate and overlies pisiform and the proximal edge of the flexor retinaculum.
