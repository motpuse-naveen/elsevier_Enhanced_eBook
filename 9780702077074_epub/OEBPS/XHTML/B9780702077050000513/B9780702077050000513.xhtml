The rest of the palm is supplied by branches from the common palmar digital arteries that pierce the palmar aponeurosis, and branches from the radialis indicis artery. The palmar digital skin is supplied by branches from each digital artery. In the distal phalanx, the two digital arteries typically form an H-shaped anastomosis, from which cutaneous perforators fan out within the pulp.

The blood supply to the dorsum of the hand arises from longitudinal rows of four or five branches from each of the dorsal metacarpal arteries, which usually arise either directly from the radial artery or from the dorsal carpal arch. At the level of the neck of the metacarpals, where the second, third and fourth dorsal metacarpal arteries communicate with branches from the corresponding common palmar digital arteries, a large cutaneous perforating branch passes proximally to supply an area of skin as far as the dorsal aspect of the wrist.</div><div class="text" id="p0050">The blood supply to the dorsum of the fingers arises proximally from the terminal branches of the dorsal metacarpal arteries, (supplying a region as far distally as the proximal interphalangeal joint) as well as from dorsal branches of the palmar digital arteries that are given off at the level of each phalanx (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513.xhtml#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 51.4</span></a>).

These injuries occur as the result of a low velocity traction force being applied to the affected part. The plane of cleavage is through the subcutaneous tissues, leaving the underlying structures essentially intact. These injuries may occur if the hand is caught in industrial machinery, typically between rollers or in a conveyor belt.</div><div class="text" id="p0065">The most common manifestation is the ‘ring avulsion injury’, when a ring is caught and the finger rapidly pulled away (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Bamba et al 2018</a>). The degloving may be complete or partial. Complete avulsion is rare, whereas avulsion of the skin of all or part of the finger is relatively common. <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib91" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_91">Urbaniak et al (1981)</a> grouped ring avulsion injuries into three classes: those in which the blood supply is intact (class I); those in which the blood supply is compromised (class II); and those in which digits are either completely degloved or amputated (class III). While these represent injuries of increasing severity, the avulsion force required to achieve them does not occur in a linear manner (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib50" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_50">Kupfer et al 1999</a>). The longitudinal force applied to a finger causes a traction injury to the blood vessels, which may extend over a considerable distance. The crushing element of a degloving injury may cause skin necrosis and thrombosis of the underlying vessels (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_22">Brooks et al 2007</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0070">Treatment of these injuries depends on their extent (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib48" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_48">Krishnamoorthy and Karthikeyan 2011</a>). In complete avulsion, restoration of the tissue and microvascular anastomosis is called replantation. Where the skin remains attached but is devascularized, restoration of the blood supply by anastomosis is called revascularization. Because the traction injury may extend over a considerable distance, large sections of vessel may need to be excised: the judicious use of vein grafts is essential. If neither of these procedures is feasible, the avulsed skin may be defatted and reapplied to the affected part, where it effectively acts as a split skin graft. If none of these techniques is practicable, primary amputation may have to be considered. Subsequently, reconstruction may be by split-skin graft, skin/fasciocutaneous flap or free flap. The decision whether to reconstruct or to amputate is multifactorial and depends not just on the injury but on the medical, psychological and social situation of the patient.</div></section><section><a id="s0040"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0050">Basic skin flaps in reconstruction</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0080">The pedicled groin flap used to be regarded as the workhorse flap for reconstruction of the hand. Swelling due to the dependent position of the hand, and the need for a second operation, coupled with the social stigma associated with the position of the hand, has led to it falling out of favour.</div><div class="text" id="p0085">Regional and free flaps have gradually replaced the pedicled groin flap. Numerous different types of regional and free flaps have been used to cover soft tissue defects in the hand, based on the principle that the hand has a reliable vascular anatomy. The anatomical basis can be a named artery to which a free flap is attached (e.g. toe to thumb transfer), a naked vessel that can be rotated with a paddle of skin (e.g. the radial forearm and dorsal intermetacarpal artery flaps), or a skin flap based on a reliable subcutaneous blood supply (e.g. the cross-finger flap).</div><div class="text" id="p0090">The radial forearm flap was originally described by surgeons from the Shenyang Military Hospital in 1978 and was consequently known as the ‘Chinese flap’. It can be used as a free flap or as a reversed pedicled fasciocutaneous island flap to cover soft tissue defects of the ipsilateral hand. Its blood supply is based on septocutaneous perforators that arise from the distal part of the radial artery and supply the skin on the radial side of the lower forearm; these tend to become more sparse proximally. Venous drainage is by the venae comitantes and superficial subcutaneous veins.</div><div class="text" id="p0095">The ulnar forearm flap is a fasciocutaneous flap based on the ulnar artery distal to its common interosseous branch. A variant on this flap based on the ascending branch of the dorsal ulnar artery was described by <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Becker and Gilbert (1988)</a>. It has the disadvantage of a short pedicle but is useful for achieving cover of defects of the proximal and ulnar side of the palm. For each of these flaps, the patency of the other vessel must be confirmed by the clinical ‘Allen occlusive test’ wherein both radial and ulnar arteries are occluded by digital pressure at the wrist then the ulnar or radial artery is released: perfusion of the hand indicates adequate residual flow in the other artery. This test is now supplemented by Doppler ultrasonography and angiography.</div><div class="text" id="p0100">The posterior interosseous island flap, distally based on the dorsal carpal arterial arch via the anastomoses between the posterior and anterior interosseous arteries just lateral to the head of the ulna (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Costa et al 2007</a>), was introduced by Zancolli and Angrigiani in 1985 (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib100" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_100">Zancolli and Angrigiani 1988</a>). Its principal advantages are that it spares both of the major arteries of the forearm and is a good match for the skin colour and texture of the dorsum of the hand. Care must be taken to avoid injury to the adjacent posterior interosseous nerve when harvesting the flap. Doppler studies should be carried out preoperatively to ensure the presence and positioning of the anastomoses between the posterior and anterior interosseous arteries. It has been claimed that most defects of the hand can be treated using this flap; its particular advantage is in the treatment of hand injuries with severe accompanying vascular damage.</div><div class="text" id="p0105">The anatomical distribution of the first dorsal metacarpal artery allows a flap of skin over the dorsum of the proximal phalanx of the index finger to be raised on the artery and its accompanying venae comitantes. This flap is particularly useful under certain circumstances for reconstruction of the thumb following injury. The distribution of the second, third and fourth dorsal metacarpal arteries allows the surgical elevation of flaps of dorsal skin based either proximally, on the dorsal metacarpal arteries proper, or distally, on their direct cutaneous branches. These flaps may be used for reconstructing areas of missing tissue elsewhere in the hand. The dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar artery is constant and can support a flap of skin on the medial aspect of the distal forearm just proximal to the wrist; it is useful in the reconstruction of areas of missing skin in this region.</div><div class="text" id="p0110">Anatomical studies that define the cutaneous vascularity of the hand provide the scientific foundations of new skin flap techniques.

The retinaculum is crossed superficially by the ulnar vessels and nerve, immediately radial to the pisiform, and by the palmar cutaneous branches of the median and ulnar nerves (see <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_split_a.xhtml#f0120">Fig. 51.27</a>). A slender band of fascia, the superficial part of the flexor retinaculum, bridges the ulnar neurovascular bundle and is attached to the radial side of the pisiform, forming a tunnel (Guyon’s canal), which is the occasional site of ulnar nerve entrapment (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513.xhtml#f0175"><span class="bold">Fig. 51.10</span></a>). The tendons of palmaris longus and flexor carpi ulnaris are partly attached to the anterior surface of the retinaculum.

The loculi are contained within defined fibrous boundaries, which means that the shape, but not the volume, of each loculus can change. The compliance or deformability of the boundaries determines the amount of shock absorption. The palm also contains much larger fibrous compartments between skin and skeleton that transmit muscles, tendons and other structures. The honeycomb pattern of these compartments constitutes the palmar shock absorption system. The soft, padded parts of the hand are able to conform to the contours of objects that are grasped which allows better interpretation of sensation and better grip. The hand must also resist tensile loading. Tendons and ligaments are particularly suitable for resisting such forces but many other parts of the fascial continuum, such as the anchorage system of the palm, also play a major role in resisting ‘pulling’ forces.</div></section><section><a id="s0150"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0140">Anchorage</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0230">Whilst the thin hair-bearing skin on the dorsum has considerable excursion on flexion and extension, the thick palmar skin is retained by fascial ligaments that allow the hand to flex while retaining the skin in position. The palmar creases have been described as skin ‘joints’. Fascial anchors may be vertical (perpendicular to the palm), as in the mid-palm, where scattered vertical fibres run from the dermis down into the depths of the hand; horizontal (in the plane of the palm); or oblique to the skin surface. As the hand grips an object, the skin creases constrain each intervening cushion of fat to provide a secure conforming grip; adhesion is further improved by sweating of the palmar skin.</div><div class="text" id="p0235">The insertion of the longitudinal (pretendinous) fibres of the palmar aponeurosis is an example of a well-developed horizontal anchorage system. The most superficial longitudinal fibres insert into the dermis of the distal palm. This arrangement resists horizontal shearing force in gripping tasks, such as holding a hammer, where it prevents distal skin slippage or degloving of the palm during use. The characteristic blisters on the palms of those unaccustomed to such use map out the sites of the skin anchorage points. This anchorage system can be demonstrated by flexing the palm until the skin of the distal palm folds loosely. An attempt to pull the loose skin distally will reveal the anchoring longitudinal fibres of the palmar aponeurosis. Oblique anchors occur in the fingers where Cleland’s ligaments tether the skin of the proximal and middle segments of the digits to the region of the proximal interphalangeal joints.</div></section></section></section></section><a id="s0135"/><section><a id="s5135"/><section><a id="s4135"/><section><a id="s6135"/><section><a id="s0155"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0145">Binding</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0240">Transversely orientated fascial structures help to maintain the transverse arch of the hand by ‘binding’ the underlying skeletal structures or the tendon sheaths.</div></section><section><a id="s0160"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0150">Limiting or tethering</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0245">Joint motion is limited not only by the action of its ligaments but also, in some cases, by skin tightness.

Biomechanical studies of tendons gliding within their sheaths have emphasized the importance of avoiding extreme postures of a joint, which increase the friction between tendon and pulley, as well as the need to establish a smooth, well-lubricated tendon surface after repair. Increased friction within a tendon sheath may, in part, explain the cause of spontaneous rupture of extensor pollicis longus because the gliding resistance of the tendon has been shown to be significantly higher than that of other tendons (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_14">An 2007</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0170"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0160">Vascular protection and pumping action</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0260">The blood vessels of the palm are surrounded by a cuff of tough fascia or by a fatty pad.

Mechanical stimuli subsequently cause the alignment of myofibroblasts along the lines of traction, which are later replaced by collagen. These collagenous cords cause the flexion contractures that characterize the disease. Treatment of Dupuytren’s disease includes suppressing myofibroblast turnover with radiotherapy; dividing the cord (fasciotomy) with a percutaneous needle or an enzyme (collagenase); surgically removing the cord (fasciectomy), which can include removal of the overlying involved skin (dermofasciectomy), and replacement with disease-free skin from elsewhere (skin autograft).</div><div class="text" id="p0280">The pattern of contracture is determined by the anatomy of the basic constituents of the palmar and digital fasciae. The physiological ‘bands’ formed by the healthy palmar fascia are replaced by pathological ‘cords’ of diseased tissue. The pretendinous bands that constitute the superficial layer (layer 1) of the palmar aponeurosis are most frequently involved. The development of nodules that tether the skin to the deep fascia usually precedes cord formation. Contracture of the pretendinous cords causes flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints. Shortening of the vertical fibres causes skin pits. Involvement of the natatory ligament restricts abduction of the fingers. The transverse metacarpal fibres are never contracted and are a useful surgical landmark in the palm because the neurovascular bundle runs deep to them. The vertical fibres can become very thickened but do not contract: they form a dense barrier between the flexor tendons and the neurovascular bundle.</div><div class="text" id="p0285">The pretendinous cord in the palm extends into a finger as a central cord that lies superficially in the midline.

It lies deep to the palmar aponeurosis, between the radial and ulnar condensations of vertical fibres that connect the palmar aponeurosis to the thenar and hypothenar eminences. Partitions that pass deeply from the longitudinal bands of the palmar aponeurosis form eight narrow compartments; four contain the digital flexor tendons and four contain the lumbricals and the neurovascular bundles.</div><section><a id="s0190"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0180">Infections of the hand</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0310">The spaces of the hand form predictable sites of infection and also limit its spread. Infections in the digit can occur in the nail fold (paronychia); the distal pulp (a felon); and the flexor sheaths. The flexor synovial sheath of the thumb and the little finger often connect in the palm (see <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_split_a.xhtml#f0120">Fig. 51.27C</a>) such that an infection in one can spread to the other causing a ‘horseshoe abscess’. Deep infections in the palm are not usually confined to any particular space; the infection may be inoculated by direct penetration but more often occurs from a primary infection in the web space or flexor sheath.</div><div class="text" id="p0315">An abscess in any of the digital or palmar spaces should always be drained. An understanding of the anatomy is crucial to successful surgical treatment. Incisions should, wherever possible, follow the line of the flexion creases and adhere to the principles of extensile exposure. A felon is drained with a midlateral incision or midline incision avoiding the neurovascular bundle and spreading apart the taut vertical septa. A web space infection is drained with a longitudinal incision that allows extensile exposure of the web space and the lumbrical-interosseous canals, also avoiding a web contracture that would follow a transverse incision. A thenar space abscess is drained through a palmar incision: the motor and palmar cutaneous branches of the median nerve are very vulnerable to iatrogenic damage (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_19">Birch 2011</a>). The mid-palmar space is best approached through a combination of a transverse distal palmar incision with an oblique longitudinal extension (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib56" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_56">McDonald et al 2011</a>), although alternative incisions can be employed, based on the location and size of the collection. Hypothenar space infections are very rare and tend to be confined by the hypothenar fascia, resulting in swelling of the ulnar side of the hand with some flexion and adduction of the little finger. These lesions are of less clinical consequence than other palmar collections because there is no direct communication with the two other major palmar spaces and hence the long flexors of the fingers and lumbricals are not involved. They may be drained by an incision along the ulnar border of the space without significant risk of damage to underlying structures. The flexor sheath is drained by a transverse or oblique incision over the flexion crease of the distal interphalangeal joint and another over the distal palmar (metacarpophalangeal) joint crease.</div></section><section><a id="s0195"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0185">Compartment syndrome of the hand</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0325">There are 10 identifiable muscle compartments in the hand: four contain each of the dorsal interossei; three contain the palmar interossei; three contain the thenar, hypothenar and adductor compartments. Any or all of these compartments may be injured by a rise in intracompartmental pressure caused by bleeding, blast, burn, crush, ischaemia–reperfusion and by injection, whether of therapeutic substances at low pressure or of industrial agents at high pressure. This rise in pressure prevents venous inflow then capillary (low pressure) inflow. Arterial (high pressure) inflow persists which causes yet more congestion; this compounds the rise in compartment pressure and the condition deteriorates. The tissues then become ischaemic, causing transient impairment then permanent necrosis. The hand will be extremely painful, usually with tingling and weakness due to nerve ischaemia. It becomes increasingly swollen. On examination, the tissues are tense; passive movement of the fingers is very painful due to stretching of the ischaemic muscles. There will be reduced sensitivity in the territory of the nerves passing through the compartment. Intra-compartmental pressure measurements should be taken; the means by which this is done is not critical (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib68" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_68">Ortiz and Berger 1998</a>) but it should not delay emergency surgery if the diagnosis is reasonably suspected.</div></section></section></section><a id="s0200"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0190">Bones</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0330">The skeleton of the hand comprises the carpus, metacarpus and the phalanges.</div><section><a id="s0205"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0195">Carpus</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0335">The carpus contains eight bones: four each in proximal and distal rows (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513.xhtml#f0060"><span class="bold">Figs 51.13</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513.xhtml#f0070"><span class="bold">51.15</span></a>).

The ulnar projection is formed by the pisiform and the hook (hamulus) of the hamate. The pisiform is at the proximal border of the hypothenar eminence, on the ulnar side of the palm, and it is easily felt in front of the triquetrum.

The former is distal on the anterior scaphoid surface and palpable (sometimes also visible) as a small medial knob at the proximal border of the palmar thenar eminence, radial to the tendon of flexor carpi radialis. The tubercle of the trapezium is a vertically rounded ridge on the anterior surface of the bone, slightly hollow medially and just distal and radial to the scaphoid tubercle. The scaphoid can be moved passively into extension by direct backward pressure onto the scaphoid tubercle. The carpal groove is converted into an osseofibrous carpal tunnel by the flexor retinaculum which is attached to its margins: the tunnel transmits flexor tendons and the median nerve into the hand. The retinaculum strengthens the carpus and augments flexor efficiency.

The fracture most commonly occurs at the waist of the bone, probably because, on impact, the scaphoid folds into flexion over the taut radioscaphocapitate ligament. Distal tubercle fractures occur as a result of avulsions by the attached radial collateral ligament. Proximal fractures are the result of avulsion by the scapholunate ligament. <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_24">Compson (1998)</a>, in a study of the true, rather than the radiological, anatomy of scaphoid fractures, identified three distinct fracture patterns: transverse through the ‘surgical waist’; oblique (45° to the surgical waist) in the plane of the dorsal sulcus; and through the proximal pole. A fractured scaphoid is prone to non-union because of its anatomy. Since it is largely covered by articular cartilage, the surface area for arterial inflow is limited. There is no arterial inflow through the scapholunate ligament proximally; the blood supply enters distally, which means that a fracture through the waist or more proximally will cut off the blood supply to the proximal pole.

Up to eight small vessels usually enter both the dorsal and the palmar aspects of the bone, three on the dorsal surface and five on the palmar; they divide into smaller branches within the bone.

It is shaped like a pea, with a distolateral long axis (see <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513.xhtml#f0070">Fig. 51.15D</a>). It bears a dorsal flat articular facet for the triquetrum. The tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris and its distal continuations, the pisometacarpal and pisohamate ligaments, are all attached to the palmar non-articular area. The deep motor branch of the ulnar nerve runs on its radial side.</div></section><section><a id="s0265"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0235">Trapezium</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0395">The trapezium has a tubercle and groove on its rough palmar surface (see <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513.xhtml#f0070">Fig. 51.15E</a>). The tendon of flexor carpi radialis passes dorsomedial to the tubercle which acts as a pulley to prevent flexor carpi radialis from bowstringing palmarwards on flexion. Two layers of the flexor retinaculum are attached to its margins. The tubercle is obscured by the thenar muscles attached to it (opponens pollicis, flexor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis brevis) (see <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513.xhtml#f0060">Fig. 51.13B</a>). The elongated, rough dorsal surface is related to the radial artery. The large lateral surface is rough for attachment of the radial collateral ligament and capsular ligament of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb. A large sellar surface faces distolaterally and articulates with the base of the first metacarpal. Most distally, it projects between the bases of the first and second metacarpals and carries a small, quadrilateral, distomedially directed facet that articulates with the base of the second metacarpal. The large medial surface is gently concave for articulation with the trapezoid. The proximal surface is a small, slightly concave facet for articulation with the scaphoid. Its ridge, or ‘summit’, fits the concavity of the base of the first metacarpal, and extends in a palmar and lateral direction, at an angle of approximately 60° with the plane of the second and third metacarpals. Abduction and adduction occur in the plane of the ridge, which is shorter than the corresponding metacarpal groove. Their contours vary reciprocally: they are more curved near the base of the second metacarpal, whereas the radius of curvature is longer further away from this site. The two surfaces are not completely congruent, and the area of close contact probably moves towards the palm in adduction and dorsally in abduction. While the axis of flexion/extension passes through the trapezium, the axis for adduction/abduction is in the metacarpal base. Flexion is accompanied by medial rotation, and extension by lateral rotation.</div></section><section><a id="s0270"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0240">Trapezoid</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0400">The trapezoid is small and irregular.

Its lateral border is a concave strip for articulation with the medial side of the base of the second metacarpal. Its dorsomedial angle usually bears a facet for articulation with the base of the fourth metacarpal. The head projects into the concavity formed by the lunate and scaphoid, the proximal surface articulates with the lunate, and the lateral surface with the scaphoid. The facets for the scaphoid and trapezoid, though usually continuous on the distolateral surface, may be separated by a rough interval. The medial surface bears a large facet for articulation with the hamate, which is deeper proximally where it is partly non-articular.

The hamulus is curved with a lateral concavity and its tip inclines laterally, contributing to the medial wall of the carpal tunnel. The tendon of flexor digitorum profundus to the little finger passes directly radial to the hamulus which acts as a pulley because the origin of this tendon is more radial than its insertion. The flexor retinaculum is attached to the apex of the hamulus. Distally, on the base of the hamulus, a slight transverse groove may be in contact with the terminal deep branch of the ulnar nerve. The remaining palmar surface, like the dorsal, is roughened for the attachment of ligaments. A faint ridge divides the distal surface into a smaller lateral facet that articulates with the base of the fourth metacarpal, and a medial facet for articulation with the base of the fifth. The proximal surface, the thin margin of the wedge, sometimes bears a narrow facet that contacts a reciprocal facet on the lunate. The medial surface is a broad strip, convex proximally, concave distally, that articulates with the triquetrum; distally, a narrow medial strip is non-articular.

These are small long bones, with a distal head, shaft and expanded base. The rounded heads articulate with the proximal phalanges. The articular surfaces of the head are convex, although less so transversely, and extend further on the palmar surfaces, especially at their margins. From a distal perspective the metacarpal head has a trapezoidal shape and is broader on its palmar aspect than its dorsal. The knuckles are produced by the metacarpal heads. The metacarpal bases articulate with the distal carpal row and with each other. The shafts have longitudinally concave palmar surfaces, which form hollows for the palmar muscles. Their dorsal surfaces bear a distal triangular area, which is continued proximally as a round ridge. These surfaces are palpable proximal to the knuckles.</div><div class="text" id="p0430">The medial four metacarpals gently diverge proximodistally. The first metacarpal is more anterior and rotated medially on its axis through 90°, so that its morphologically dorsal surface is lateral, its radial border palmar, its palmar surface medial, and its ulnar border dorsal. Hence, the thumb flexes medially across the palm and can be rotated into opposition with each finger. Opposition is important in manual dexterity and depends on pronation of the thumb carpometacarpal joint and flexion-supination of the little finger carpometacarpal joint. When an object is grasped, the fingers and thumb encircle it from opposite sides, greatly increasing the power and precision of the grip.</div><section><a id="s0295"/><hgroup><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0265">Individual metacarpals</h4><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0270">First metacarpal</h5></hgroup><section><a id="s0300"/><div class="textfl" id="p0435">The first metacarpal is shorter and thicker than the other metacarpals (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513.xhtml#f0075"><span class="bold">Fig</span>. <span class="bold">51.17A</span></a>). Its dorsal (lateral) surface can be felt to face laterally; its long axis diverges distolaterally from its neighbour. The shaft is flattened, dorsally broad and transversely convex. The palmar (medial) surface is longitudinally concave and divided by a ridge into a larger lateral (anterior) and smaller medial (posterior) part. Opponens pollicis is attached to the radial border and adjoining palmar surface: the first dorsal interosseous muscle (radial head) is attached to its ulnar border and adjacent palmar surface. The base is concavo-convex and articulates with the trapezium. Abductor pollicis longus is attached on its lateral (palmar) side, the first palmar interosseous muscle to its ulnar side.

The palmar facet may be absent: less frequently, the facets are connected proximally by a narrow bridge. The palmar surface of the base receives a slip from the tendon of flexor carpi radialis: extensor carpi radialis brevis is attached to its dorsal surface, beyond the styloid process. The shaft resembles that of the second metacarpal. The ulnar head of the second dorsal interosseous muscle is attached to its lateral surface; the radial head of the third dorsal interosseous is attached to its medial surface, and the transverse head of adductor pollicis to the intervening palmar ridge in its distal two-thirds.

Centres for the second to fifth metacarpal heads appear in that order in the second year in females, and between 1½ to 2½ years in males. They unite with the shafts about the fifteenth or sixteenth year in females, and the eighteenth or nineteenth in males. The first metacarpal base begins to ossify late in the second year in females, early in the third year in males, uniting before the fifteenth year in females and seventeenth in males. Sometimes, the styloid process of the third metacarpal is a separate ossicle. The thumb metacarpal ossifies like a phalanx, and some authorities therefore consider that the thumb skeleton consists of three phalanges. Others believe that the distal phalanx represents fused middle and distal phalanges, a condition occasionally observed in the fifth toe. When the thumb has three phalanges, the metacarpal has a distal and a proximal epiphysis. It occasionally bifurcates distally. When it does, the medial branch has no distal epiphysis and bears two phalanges, while the lateral branch shows a distal epiphysis, and three phalanges. The existence of only a distal metacarpal epiphysis may be associated with a greater range of movement at the metacarpophalangeal joint. In the thumb, the carpometacarpal joint has the wider range, and the first metacarpal has a basal epiphysis. A distal epiphysis may appear in the first, and a proximal epiphysis in the second, metacarpal.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="964" id="pagebreak_964"/><a id="pg964"/></div></section></section><section><a id="s0330"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0300">Phalanges</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0470">There are 14 phalanges, three in each finger and two in the thumb (see <a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513.xhtml#f0080">Fig. 51.18</a>). Each has a head, shaft and proximal base. The shaft tapers distally, its dorsal surface transversely convex. The palmar surface is transversely flat but gently concave anteriorly in its long axis. The bases of the proximal phalanges carry concave, oval facets adapted to the metacarpal heads. Their own heads have a midline dorsal–palmar groove and encroach more on to the palmar surfaces. The bases of the middle phalanges carry two concave facets separated by a smooth ridge, conforming to the heads of the proximal phalanges and a dorsal lip to receive the central slip of the extensor tendon. The bases of the distal phalanges are adapted to the shallow midline groove of the middle phalangeal heads. A dorsal lip receives the conjoined extensor tendon and a palmar lip receives the flexor digitorum profundus tendon.

It is inherently unstable and controlled by specific retaining and gliding ligaments. Its relative position is determined by the dimensions of the space between the radius, triangular fibrocartilage complex and ulna on one side, and the rigid distal carpal row on the other. The proximal carpal row is subject to two opposing moments: the scaphoid straddles the proximal and distal rows and tends to rotate the proximal row into flexion under axial load and radial deviation. At the same time, there is a force tending to extend the proximal row, which is initiated by the distal row and transmitted via the midcarpal ligaments to the triquetrum. Stability of the midcarpal joint is thus ensured during both movement and loading. The distal carpal row (trapezium, trapezoid, capitate and hamate) can be regarded as one rigid structure. The scaphoid bridges the proximal and distal carpal rows and provides a functional couple between the two.</div><div class="text" id="p0740">Movement of the carpus was originally quantified by measuring carpal bone length in static radiographs while the wrist was moved in orthogonal anatomical planes.

A wrist is said to be kinetically unstable when it cannot bear physiological loads without giving way or causing injury, and to be kinematically unstable when it exhibits sudden changes in carpal alignment during movement, manifest as a ‘clunk’ as one or more of the carpal bones move abnormally with respect to the others. Stability of the various joints, so that the bones maintain normal anatomical relations with respect to each other throughout the normal range of motion, is essential for physiological load transmission. Disruption of this complex system leads to pain, loss of function and, in time, degeneration of the articular surfaces.</div><div class="text" id="p0810">Some degree of carpal instability may occur as part of inherent hypermobility in affected individuals. More commonly it occurs after acute rupture or chronic attenuation of intrinsic and extrinsic carpal ligaments, which may be detected either clinically or radiologically as malalignment of the carpal bones. In clinical practice, certain patterns of instability predominate.</div><div class="text" id="p0815">Garcia-Elias described a kinetic theory of carpal stability that states that the neutral posture of the lunate is preserved by balancing the flexion moment of the scaphoid with the extension moment of the triquetrum (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_38">Garcia-Elias 1997</a>). When axially loaded, these rotational forces increase. If the interosseous scapholunate ligament is disrupted then the extension moment of the triquetrum remains unopposed leading to an extended position of the lunate. This is referred to as dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI). In the absence of the luno-triquetral ligament the scaphoid flexion moment loses its antagonistic extension moment from the triquetrum and the lunate adopts a flexed posture: this is termed volar intercalated segment instability (VISI).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0685"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0560">Carpometacarpal joints</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0565">Carpometacarpal joint of the thumb</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0690"/><section><a id="s0695"/><section><a id="s0700"/><section><a id="s0705"/><section><a id="s0710"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0570">Articulating surfaces</p><div class="textfl" id="p0820">The carpometacarpal joint of the thumb (basal joint of the thumb) is a sellar joint between the first metacarpal base and trapezium.

Rotation accompanies flexion–extension, e.g. when the finger flexes and rotates to place its tip near the centre of the palm. The range of rotation is frequently increased as a result of the resistance of a grasped object. Active flexion is 90° or more and is greater in the little finger than in the index. The range of extension depends on whether it is active or passive: the former is limited by the resistance of the antagonistic muscles, the latter is significantly greater because the volar plate offers little resistance. (This contrasts with the thumb–metacarpophalangeal joint and all the proximal interphalangeal joints, in which a rigid volar plate prevents hyperextension, so that passive and active extension are equal.) Passive extension is greater in the little finger than in the index. The range can be even greater in those with generally lax joints. The trapezoidal shape of the metacarpal heads means that the collateral ligament allows no ulnar or radial deviation of the proximal phalanx when the joint is fully flexed, but allows the fingers to move through about 20° in each direction when the joints are extended.</div><div class="text" id="p0975">Slight supination (lateral rotation) accompanies digital flexion of the middle, ring and little fingers.

Chronic attritional tears of this ligament are traditionally reported to occur in gamekeepers from wringing the necks of pheasants. Acute injuries typically occur in skiers who fall onto an outstretched hand while having the strap of a ski pole wrapped around the thumb, or if the thumb is caught in the snow (or the grid of an artificial slope). The ligament may be avulsed directly from the bone or with a pyramidal fragment of bone. The fragment also includes the insertion of the volar plate, flexor sheath and part of adductor pollicis. The ulnar collateral ligament is normally covered by the aponeurotic fibres of the tendon of adductor pollicis. Following avulsion, the proximal end can become superficially displaced around the proximal free edge of the aponeurotic insertion of adductor pollicis. This is termed a Stener lesion (<a href="../B9780702077050000513/B9780702077050000513_bib.xhtml#bib60" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_60">Mattox et al 2015</a>). The soft tissue interposition prevents the ends of the avulsed ligament from healing. The presence of a Stener lesion is indicated clinically if there is more than 30° of radial laxity when stressing the metacarpophalangeal joint in 40° of flexion. If the joint is assessed in extension, then the lateral fibres of the volar plate may contribute significantly to the lateral stability of the joint and give a false impression of stability. Surgical repair requires division of the aponeurotic fibres of adductor pollicis to expose the insertion, followed by reattachment of the avulsed ligament to its attachment in the anteromedial corner of the proximal phalanx. Postoperative rehabilitation requires early movement of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb, otherwise the adductor aponeurosis will adhere to the repair and prevent flexion of the tip. The ulnar collateral ligament is isometric, i.e. the same length in flexion and extension. Consequently, early movement of the metacarpophalangeal joint will prevent adherence of the repair to the side of the joint, which would otherwise limit movement.</div><div class="text" id="p1020">The comparable injury to the radial collateral ligament is less common. It is caused by sudden, forced adduction of the metacarpophalangeal joint as the result of a fall or during ball games. The ligament may be ruptured in its mid-substance or avulsed from either bony attachment, usually the distal. A Stener lesion does not occur because the aponeurosis of abductor pollicis brevis is closely apposed to the joint and thus does not provide the space.</div></section></section></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0970"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0775">Interphalangeal joints</h3><div class="textfl" id="p1025">The interphalangeal joints are uniaxial hinge joints.</div><section><a id="s0975"/><section><a id="s0980"/><section><a id="s0985"/><section><a id="s0990"/><section><a id="s0995"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0780">Fibrous capsule</p><div class="textfl" id="p1030">Each interphalangeal joint has a fibrous capsule.</div></section><section><a id="s1000"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0785">Ligaments</p><div class="textfl" id="p1035">The proximal interphalangeal joint is stable in all positions.
