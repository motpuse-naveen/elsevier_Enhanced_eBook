This is a debate that simmers in the disciplines of anthropology, genetics and genealogy. Generations can be very short, with both males and females becoming parents in their early teens, or very long, with men fathering children in their 10th decade, but these variations are uncommon. It is probable that the average male generation is somewhere between 30 and 35 years and that female generations are shorter, at between 25 and 30 years. Despite a long-held assumption that generations were shorter in prehistoric societies there is now evidence to suggest that these mean generational gaps have been stable for millennia (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Tremblay and Vézina 2000</a>, <a href="#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_8">Helgason et al 2003</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0015">For genealogists these figures are used as a rule of thumb to assess the integrity of a family tree. Too few generations in a given century alerts them to the possibility of missing data. For geneticists these figures are used to estimate the rate at which mutations have occurred in our genome. And in evolutionary terms these figures may determine the age at which our bodies begin to fail.</div><div class="text" id="p0020">It seems reasonable to argue that the child of a parent who remains healthy, until their offspring are independent, is more likely to survive and propagate their genes than the progeny of a weak and feeble parent. The traits of good health in parenthood would therefore be passed on to subsequent generations whereas the weaker phenotype would be less likely to endure. Assuming that the age of independence is 15, then the evolutionary driver is a parent who is healthy until the age of 45. After that a healthy parent is much less likely to contribute to the survival of the offspring; evolution has selected a human phenotype that remains strong until the age of 45 and then starts to fall apart.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">While the estimate of intervals between generations has an evidence base, my subsequent argument is a hypothesis. One that is supported by a number of facts: at 45 we go grey (<a href="#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_24">Van Neste and Tobin 2004</a>), we become short sighted (<a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_14">Michael and Bron 2011</a>) and we suffer a peak in short-term musculoskeletal pain (<a href="#bib4" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_4">Claus et al 2019</a>). At age 45 the production of new collagen in cartilage and bone falls to the lowest level in our lifetimes (<a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Mouritzen et al 2003</a>) and we start to shrink (<a href="#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_21">Sorkin et al 1999</a>).</div><section><a id="s0010"/><section><a id="s0015"/><h2 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0010">Cartilage</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0030">Normal hyaline cartilage in a young adult has a laminar appearance on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. I.3.1</span></a>). The vertical and oblique zones of type 1 collagen fibres that make up the parabolic arcades of Benninghoff (<a href="#bib2" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_2">Benninghoff 1925</a>), and the armour-plated surface layer can be differentiated because the orientation of collagen fibres influences the signal generated by radiofrequency pulses. The extracellular matrix of cartilage, consisting mainly of glycosaminoglycan, is hygroscopic; as water is absorbed the cartilage expands until limited by the collagen arcades. This balanced tension between expanding extracellular matrix and restraining collagen is often referred to as a hydrostatic cushion, implying that hyaline articular cartilage plays a significant role in load distribution. As we shall see later this may not be the case, and the main role of hydrostatic cartilage may be to resist shearing forces.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050001002/main.assets/on100-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. I.3.1</span> Sagittal fat-saturated proton density MR images through the medial tibiofemoral compartment of the knee of a 24-year-old (<span class="bold">A</span>) and a 62-year-old (<span class="bold">B</span>) male patient.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0035">As we age, our chondrocytes die. Those that survive synthesize less glycosaminoglycan which means that less water is bound into the cartilage, which gets thinner and loses its compressive stiffness (<a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_10">Lotz and Loeser 2012</a>). This age-related biological degeneration is commonly seen in routine clinical practice (<a href="#f0010">Fig. I.3.1</a>) where, paradoxically, many musculoskeletal radiologists will resist describing them as degenerative. This is because in clinical practice the terms ‘degeneration’ and ‘osteoarthritis’ are often used interchangeably. An alternative approach is to describe uncomplicated thinning of articular cartilage as normal age-related change, the assumption being that this does not contribute to symptoms. Once the integrity of the articular cartilage has been breached, or there is reactive subchondral bone marrow signal, this may then be described as being ‘degenerative’. When the clinical history or secondary signs of inflammation support the diagnosis, then these findings can be interpreted as ‘osteoarthritis’.</div><div class="text" id="p0040">All these assumptions and tortuous semantic manipulations illustrate one of the principal difficulties that clinicians and scientists have when approaching the ageing musculoskeletal system. We do not have a language that allows us to differentiate normal ageing from degenerative disease and the imaging phenotypes do not allow us to separate the two with any certainty.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">For the purpose of clinical practice most clinicians consider diffuse thinning of articular cartilage to be a predictable asymptomatic feature of the ageing musculoskeletal system. This does not mean that it is entirely benign. The thin, soft and collagen-depleted cartilage is less resistant to shearing injuries and is therefore a risk factor for developing osteoarthritis (OA). The knee joint in particular is dependent on the integrity of the cruciate and collateral ligaments, rather than the profile of the articular surfaces, for its stability. As the joint space narrows so these ligaments become redundant and the joint becomes intrinsically less stable; there is a view that the redundancy of stabilizing ligaments caused by joint space narrowing is a significant source of symptoms (<a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Hunter et al 2008</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Bone</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0050">The ability of bone to resist fracture is defined by two characteristics: strength, a measure of maximum load without failure, and toughness, the ability to flex under a deforming force. While bone mineral density contributes to both of these functions it appears that ageing type 1 collagen is an important contributor to bone fragility (<a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_3">Boskey and Coleman 2010</a>). The mechanical properties of collagen in bone are determined <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1.464E138" id="pagebreak_1.464E138"/><a id="pg1464.e136"/>by the type of cross-link between fibrils. New collagen is connected by cross-links that result from a specific enzymatic reaction. As collagen persists in tissues the method of cross-linkage changes to glycation or oxidation. With increasing age, the production of new collagen slows down and these non-enzymatic cross-links predominate, with a concomitant decrease in bone strength and a reduction in toughness (<a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Saito and Marumo 2010</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0055">The effect of these changes in stiffness can be seen on radiographs in the form of subchondral sclerosis (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">MacKay et al 2014</a>). This has long been recognized as one of the hallmarks of OA, together with irregular joint space loss, osteophytes and subchondral cysts, but there is evidence that sclerosis can develop in the absence of any of the other features of OA. High resolution MRI of the subchondral bone in asymptomatic middle-aged volunteers demonstrates increased subchondral sclerosis but also significant differences in trabecular architecture when compared to young asymptomatic volunteers (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. I.3.2</span></a>) (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">MacKay et al 2016</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050001002/main.assets/on100-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. I.3.2</span> Coronal high resolution T1-weighted trabecular maps of subchondral bone in (<span class="bold">A</span>) 27-year-old and (<span class="bold">B</span>) 46 year-old asymptomatic male volunteers demonstrating changes in the conspicuity and texture of subchondral trabecular bone with age (arrows). <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Dr James MacKay, University of East Anglia.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0060">One explanation for this is that bone is a major contributor to the dissipation of loads through a weight-bearing joint, i.e. it is an important shock absorber. Bone has been estimated to account for up to 40% of the load-damping capacity of a limb in some animal models (<a href="#bib6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_6">Dodge et al 2012</a>). One consequence of the increased stiffness of non-enzymatic cross-linked collagen is that these loads will not be as efficiently dissipated along the length of a weight-bearing bone. Therefore loading will become more localized and increased over smaller volumes of bone. According to Wolff’s law, that volume of bone will then adapt by laying down more bone and the result will be subchondral sclerosis.</div><div class="text" id="p0065">Osteoporosis is reduced bone mineral density that is most commonly related to age and in particular to postmenopausal females. It is an independent risk factor for developing fragility fractures, but it is not the only variable that contributes to bone fragility; ageing collagen also contributes to reduced bone toughness. The anatomical distribution of bone loss is an important independent predictor of fragility fractures. The cross-sectional cortical morphology of bones, their curvature and the cortico-medullary distribution of mineralized osteoid and trabecular organization, all change with increasing age (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. I.3.3</span></a>). Which of these traits contribute to disease, and which do not, is only partly understood.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0020"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050001002/main.assets/on100-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0020"/><a id="fspara0020"/><span class="fignum">Fig. I.3.3</span> Conventional dorsopalmar radiographs of the proximal and middle phalanges of the right index and middle fingers of a 20-year-old female (20F) demonstrating the normal proportions of 1/3 cortex, 1/3 medulla and 1/3 cortex at the mid-diaphysis. With increasing age (49F, 61F), and with normal bone mineral density, the width of the medulla increases and the cortex decreases. In osteoporosis these normal age-related changes are accompanied by cortical tunnelling, illustrated by a longitudinal lucency in the ulnar cortex of the proximal phalanx of the index finger, and patchy secondary trabecular bone loss, best seen here at the base of the middle phalanx of the middle finger (arrows).</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0070">An example of changing anatomy that appears to relate simply to age is ‘cortical drift’. This is a process that describes the changing cross-sectional profile of long bones that occurs with increasing age and refers <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1.464E139" id="pagebreak_1.464E139"/><a id="pg1464.e137"/>to the drift away from a perfect circle. During adolescence, remodelling occurs rapidly so that in the femur of a young adult the cross-section looks like a polygon closely fitted to a circle. With increasing years the cross-section becomes more ellipsoid resulting in a wider diameter bone with relatively thinner cortices (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. I.3.4</span></a>) (<a href="#bib7" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_7">Goldman 2009</a>). What causes this change in shape is not understood, neither has it been associated with any adverse outcomes. This is an example of an age-related anatomical feature that, for the moment, we assume to be a ‘normal’ finding in the absence of evidence to the contrary.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0025"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050001002/main.assets/on100-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0025"/><a id="fspara0025"/><span class="fignum">Fig. I.3.4</span> Axial CT through the left femur of (<span class="bold">A</span>) a 20-year-old male in whom the cross-section of the femoral diaphysis is roughly circular.

The secondary trabeculae are stabilizers of the longitudinal load-bearing primary trabeculae and contribute to the toughness of bone by allowing the longitudinal trabeculae to flex without fracture under increased load. Bone loss in the secondary trabeculae has a disproportionately higher impact on fragility than loss of bone in the primary trabeculae (<a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Pathria et al 2016</a>) which means that it is not only the severity of bone loss, but also the distribution of that loss, that predicts the increased risk of fragility fractures in females.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0030"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050001002/main.assets/on100-05-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0030"/><a id="fspara0030"/><span class="fignum">Fig. I.3.5</span> Anteroposterior radiographs in (<span class="bold">A</span>) 23-year-old and (<span class="bold">B</span>) 69-year-old females.

The distal patellar tendon in particular buckles during extension of the knee; it has been suggested that this reflects a property that protects the extensor mechanism during sudden extreme contraction. The proposed effect is similar to that seen in crimping of ligament fibrils. Patellar tendon buckling is usually demonstrable at any age but the tendons of the middle-aged and elderly buckle less, and unbuckle more slowly, than those of young adults (<a href="#f0035"><span class="bold">Fig. I.3.6</span></a>) (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Slane et al 2018</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0035"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050001002/main.assets/on100-06-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0035"/><a id="fspara0035"/><span class="fignum">Fig. I.3.6</span> Sagittal fat-saturated proton density MR images in two patients with acute complete tears of the anterior cruciate ligament that produce anterior translation of the tibia and redundancy of the extensor mechanism.

In fact, it may be a redundant question. Some might argue that osteoarthritis is so prevalent in old age that OA is ‘normal’. Functional impairment in the musculoskeletal system is more strongly associated with psychological profiles than with any degree of joint disruption. In other words, the happier an individual is, the less likely their ageing joints will hurt. Therefore it seems rather insular to <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1.464E140" id="pagebreak_1.464E140"/><a id="pg1464.e138"/>define normal anatomical appearances in the elderly without considering the context of their life experience (<a href="#bib5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_5">Creamer et al 2000</a>). Interestingly, strength training in the very elderly has a reassuringly wide range of positive impacts on function and happiness (<a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_13">Marcos-Pardo et al 2018</a>).

If evolution has selected for relatively homogeneous good health until the age of 45, progress thereafter is increasingly variable. The genes that code for good health in later years probably do not offer an evolutionary advantage and so are not propagated through future generations in favour of genes that code for poor health. Some individuals degenerate rapidly in middle age and present early in their life to radiologists with images demonstrating failure of articular cartilage, and the consequences of degenerating ligaments and tendons. A fortunate few maintain youthful joint alignment, hyaline cartilage integrity, muscle mass and connective tissue elasticity (<a href="#f0045"><span class="bold">Fig. I.3.9</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0045"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050001002/main.assets/on100-09-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0045"/><a id="fspara0045"/><span class="fignum">Fig. I.3.9</span> Sagittal T2-weighted MR images of the lumbar spine in 45-year-old (<span class="bold">A</span>) and 63-year-old (<span class="bold">B</span>) male patients.

The corollary for radiologists and anatomists is to try to define what constitutes a ‘healthy’ older human body. What does a normal old musculoskeletal system look like on imaging? How is that different from a patient in pain, or from someone with functional impairment, or from someone with limited quality of life scores? These are almost impossible questions to answer. Some of the strongest predictors of pain and quality of life, in a patient with a degenerative joint, are psychological status, education and wealth. An absence of pain in old age can be attributable not to ‘good health’ but rather to decent schooling, a good pension and a close circle of family and friends. The available measurable endpoints of healthy ageing, with which we can correlate anatomical imaging features, are multiple, variable and confounded.</div><div class="text" id="p0105">For now, the available scientific methods limit us to hypothesis testing.

We can do these in defined samples of individuals from whom we hope to extrapolate generalizable results. Each study will result in a one-dimensional outcome. In the future we may be able to take a more sophisticated approach to defining normal anatomy in the healthy ageing human. Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) are now vast archives of anatomical information in digital form. Full integration of healthcare records, including primary and secondary care clinic notes, pharmacy prescriptions and pathology reports, will allow us to data mine whole populations using machine learning algorithms overcoming the one dimensional limitations of hypothesis testing.
