The electrocardiogram may reveal deep narrow Q waves, left ventricular hypertrophy and left axis deviation. Radiologically, cardiomegaly is present with left ventricular and left atrial enlargement. Colour flow imaging can identify the anomalous origin of the left coronary artery. The pulmonary trunk may also give rise to the right coronary artery, the anterior interventricular branch of the left coronary artery, or even both coronary arteries.

A diminished pulmonary flow is supplied through a patent ductus arteriosus (<a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Smith and McKay 2004</a>), and a concomitant ventricular septal defect may permit outflow from the right ventricle.

As the latter crosses the aortic arch, its recurrent laryngeal branch hooks inferior to the vessel, to the left posterior aspect of the ligamentum arteriosum, and then ascends on the right of the aortic arch. The left superior intercostal vein ascends obliquely anteriorly on the arch, anterolateral to the left vagus nerve and posteromedial to the left phrenic nerve and pericardiacophrenic vessels. The left lung and pleura separate all these structures from the thoracic wall. Posterior and to the right are the trachea and the deep cardiac plexus, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, the oesophagus, thoracic duct and vertebral column. Superiorly, the brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid and left subclavian arteries arise from its convexity (from right to left), and are crossed anteriorly near their origins by the left brachiocephalic vein.

Despite their relative independence, the aortic nipple is defined by new contours in cases of pneumomediastinum, taking on an ‘inverted aortic nipple’ appearance (<a href="#f0030"><span class="bold">Fig. 58.5</span></a>). In this position, the inverted aortic nipple may facilitate radiographic discrimination of pneumomediastinum from similar conditions. The presence of a particularly prominent aortic nipple has also been shown to precede pathological conditions such as venous obstruction in the superior and inferior venae cavae or left brachiocephalic vein, and has been identified in conditions where venous flow through the left superior intercostal vein is increased (e.g. portal venous hypertension and certain congenital venous anomalies).</div><div id="p0110"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0030"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000586/main.assets/on58-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0030"/><a id="fspara0030"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 58.5</span> A posteroanterior (PA) chest radiograph, showing the ‘aortic nipple’ appearance of the left superior intercostal vein (green dot) in a patient with pneumomediastinum. <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Professor M Loukas.

In the preductal type, the length of coarctation is variable, aortic arch hypoplasia is common and the left subclavian and even the brachiocephalic trunk may be involved. Severe forms of infantile coarctation and its extreme form (aortic interruption) may be patent ductus arteriosus-dependent, as there is no time for effective collateral circulation to develop. Prostaglandin infusion prior to transfer, and surgery at a tertiary centre, often provide a good mid- to long-term outlook for such infants.</div><div class="text" id="p0170">The postductal type of coarctation has been attributed to abnormal extension of tissue of the ductus arteriosus into the aortic wall, stenosing both vessels as the duct contracts after birth. This form may permit years of normal life, allowing the development of an extensive collateral circulation to the aorta distal to the stenosis (<a href="#f0040"><span class="bold">Figs 58.7</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0045"><span class="bold">58.8</span></a>). High vascularity of the thoracic wall is important and clinically characteristic. Many arteries that arise indirectly from the aorta proximal to the region of coarctation anastomose with vessels that are connected to the aorta distal to the region of coarctation; these vessels form a bypass route and become greatly enlarged. Thus, in the thoracic wall, the thoraco-acromial, lateral thoracic and subscapular arteries (from the axillary artery), the suprascapular artery (from the subclavian artery) and the supreme intercostal artery (from the costocervical trunk) anastomose with other posterior intercostal arteries and the internal thoracic artery and its terminal branches (e.g. the musculophrenic artery) anastomose with many of the posterior intercostal arteries and the inferior epigastric arteries (from the external iliac artery). Posterior intercostal arteries are always involved, and enlargement of their dorsal branches may eventually groove (notch) the inferior margins of the ribs. The radiographic shadow of an enlarged left subclavian artery is also increased. Enlargement of the scapular vessels and anastomoses may lead to widespread interscapular pulsation which is palpated easily with the palm of the hand, and is sometimes heard on auscultation.</div><div id="p0175"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0040"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000586/main.assets/on58-05-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0040"/><a id="fspara0040"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 58.7</span> A cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) angiogram showing three-dimensional reconstruction of a native aortic coarctation (arrow) in an adult with extensive collateral flow.

Smooth muscle cells are lost and elastic fibres degenerate, producing cystic spaces in the media that then fill with mucoid material. The loss of these structural cells leads to weakening of the wall with progressive dilation. Ageing and hypertension are major predisposing factors to cystic medial degeneration and there is a strong link with cigarette smoking. Thoracic aortic aneurysms are categorized by their location. A particular pattern of aortic root involvement, anulo-aortic ectasia, is seen in Marfan syndrome (<a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_3">Baliga et al 2007</a>).

The subcostal arteries pierce the aponeurosis of transversus abdominis to become more superficial, and continue toward the anterior midline in the plane between transversus abdominis and internal abdominal oblique; they anastomose with the superior epigastric, lower posterior intercostal and lumbar arteries.

Blunt aortic rupture commonly occurs in road traffic accidents and has a 20% survival rate. There is usually a transverse tear involving the tunica intima and tunica media of the aortic wall; systemic circulatory pressure may cause the formation of a false aneurysm. Rupture of the isthmus region of the descending thoracic aorta is more common, probably because it marks the junction between the mobile and fixed parts of the aorta. Other sites include the ascending aorta proximal to the origin of the brachiocephalic trunk, the aortic arch and the abdominal aorta.

During embryological development, if the cardinal vein does not oblit-erate, it will persist as a left-sided superior vena cava. A left superior vena cava may have a slender connection with the right superior vena cava and subsequently cross the left side of the aortic arch to pass anterior to the hilum of the left lung before turning to enter the right atrium. It replaces the oblique vein of the left atrium (of Marshall) and coronary sinus, and receives all the normal tributaries of the coronary sinus. Other variations include drainage of the hemiazygos vein directly into the persistent left superior vena cava (<a href="#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_8">Liu et al 2019</a>). The left brachiocephalic vein sometimes projects above the manubrium (more frequently in childhood) and crosses the midline superior to the jugular notch, immediately anterior to the trachea. A left-sided superior vena cava may cause difficulties when placing a cardiac catheter, pacing or defibrillating electrodes because the angle between the left superior vena cava and the left subclavian vein is more acute than that normally found between the left subclavian and left brachiocephalic vein. Its calibre may also be smaller than that of the right. Even if insertion of a catheter into a left superior vena cava is possible, the angle at which the catheter enters the right atrium causes difficulty when attempting to place it into the right ventricle and pulmonary trunk; this generally leaves the catheter tip against the coronary sinus, making it difficult to obtain blood samples. In the majority of cases of persistent left superior venae cava, blood drains into the right atrium via the coronary sinus. When this does not happen, the coronary sinus is absent, and the persistent left superior vena cava drains directly into the right atrium. Cyanosis reflects a persistent right-to-left shunt and affected individuals have a higher risk for paradoxical embolism. Radiographically, there is a paramediastinal bulge anterior to the aortic arch. Electrocardiograms show a left P-wave axis. Diagnosis can be confirmed by cardiac catheterization and angiography. Persistent left superior vena cava may be asso-ciated with extracardiac conditions such as VACTERL association (vertebral defects, anal atresia, cardiac malformations, tracheo-oesophageal fistula with oesophageal atresia, radial and renal dysplasia, and limb anomalies); trisomy 21; 22q11; CHARGE association (coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, mental retardation, genital and ear anom-alies); and 45 XO karyotype (Turner syndrome).</div><div class="text" id="p5950">If the superior vena cava is duplicated, the right superior vena cava may drain into the right atrium and the left superior vena cava into the left atrium.

The abdominal course of the inferior vena cava is described in <a href="../B9780702077050000549/B9780702077050000549.xhtml">Chapter 61</a>.</div><section><a id="s0570"/><section><a id="s0575"/><section><a id="s0580"/><section><a id="s0585"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0280">Collateral venous channels</p><div class="textfl" id="p0430">In obstruction of the superior part of the inferior vena cava, the azygos and hemiazygos veins and vertebral venous plexuses are the main collateral channels that maintain venous circulation. They connect the superior and inferior venae cavae and communicate with the common iliac vein via the ascending lumbar veins and with multiple tributaries of the inferior vena cava.</div></section><section><a id="s0590"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0285">Variations</p><div class="textfl" id="p0435">The inferior vena cava may be congenitally interrupted, duplicated, left-sided or even absent.</div><div class="text" id="p0440">Embryologically, if the right subcardinal vein fails to anastomose with the hepatic sinusoids, the hepatic segment of the inferior vena cava fails to develop. When this occurs, the hemiazygos or azygos veins, both of which originate from the cranial supracardinal veins, return blood to the heart. Azygos continuation of the inferior vena cava, characterized by a prominent azygos vein, is a variant that the paediatric surgeon should be aware of when undertaking repair of oesophageal atresia and tracheo-oesophageal atresia in neonates. The azygos vein, which is commonly ligated and divided during this procedure, should be spared because ligation of this vessel in neonates with azygos continuation of the inferior vena cava leads to intraoperative circulatory collapse and death. Double inferior vena cava (right side usually dominant) is a result of the persistence of all or any segments of the subcardinal veins. One of the most common variations is a left-sided inferior vena cava, which is formed if the right supracardinal vein regresses and the left supracardinal vein persists (<a href="#bib179" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_179">Spratt 2016</a>). There may also be a duplication of the inferior vena cava, which typically occurs inferior to the level of the renal veins, and is the result of persistence of the left lumbar and thoracic supracardinal veins and left suprasubcardinal anastomosis as well as malformation of the right subcardinal–hepatic anastomosis. Abnormalities associated with duplication of the inferior vena cava include congenital heart disease, congenital absence of the right kidney, cloacal extrophy, renal ectopia with abdominal aneurysm, right retrocaval ureter, left retrocaval ureter and congenital absence of the iliac anastomosis, abnormal left upper limb drainage and transcaval ureter.</div><div class="text" id="p0445">In situs inversus with dextrocardia, the inferior vena cava passes inferiorly along the left side instead of the right. In situs inversus with levocardia, the inferior vena cava remains on the right side. In situs ambiguus (heterotaxy) the major organs are arranged ambiguously within the body. Prominent azygos veins with interrupted inferior vena cava are associated with heterotaxy (<a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_13">Punn and Olson 2010</a>). Situs ambiguus with polysplenia is associated with an absence of parts of the inferior vena cava on the right side (with continuation through the azygos or hemiazygos vein), transposition of the inferior vena cava to the left side, or duplication of the inferior vena cava with one on the right and one on the left. Situs inversus with asplenia is similar to that of polysplenia, in that the inferior vena cava may be absent with azygos continuation or with the inferior vena cava to the left of the midline. In situs inversus totalis, transposition of the inferior vena cava consists of a right-sided inferior vena cava. The inferior vena cava may have an abnormally high insertion into the right atrium.</div><div class="text" id="p0450">Scimitar syndrome, a form of anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, occurs when there is an abnormal connection between the right pulmonary vein(s) and the inferior vena cava. This often involves hypoplasia of the pulmonary veins and the pulmonary trunk and arteries, as well as abnormal ipsilateral lung parenchyma. This creates a left-to-right shunt and increases the risk of right ventricular failure as a result of ventricular hypertrophy. Typical symptoms include respiratory insufficiency such as recurrent respiratory infections, heart failure, or pulmonary hypertension.</div><div class="text" id="p0455">Congenital agenesis of the inferior vena cava may occur and may be completely asymptomatic because venous drainage of the lower limbs occurs through anastomosed channels of the azygos and hemiazygos veins. However, this condition may be associated with a higher risk for deep vein thrombosis.</div></section></section></section></section></section></section></section></section><footer><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1102.e2" id="pagebreak_1102.e2"/><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebib00190"/><h2 class="reftitle" id="cesectitle4605">References</h2><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebibsec00910"/><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib21"><!--<a hreef="#bib_21">21</a>. --><a id="ref0040"/><a href="#bib_21">Akgun</a> V, Hamcan S, Bozkurt Y, et al. <cite>Thoracic aorta</cite>. In: Tubbs R.S, Shoja M.M, Loukas M, eds. <cite><i>Bergman’s Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Human Anatomic Variation</i></cite>. 2nd ed. Hoboken: Wiley–Blackwell; 2016:501–529 Ch. 49.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib12"><!--<a hreef="#bib_12">12</a>. --><a id="ref0045"/><a href="#bib_12">Badshah</a> M, Soames R, Ibrahim M, et al. <cite>Surface anatomy of major anatomical landmarks of the neck in an adult population: a CT evaluation of vertebral level</cite>. <cite><i>Clin Anat</i></cite>. 2017;30(6):781–787.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib3"><!--<a hreef="#bib_3">3</a>. --><a id="ref0050"/><a href="#bib_3">Baliga</a> R.R, Neinaber C.A, Isselbacher E.M, et al. <cite><i>Aortic Dissection and Related Syndromes</i></cite>. Ann Arbor, MI: Springer; 2007.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib4"><!--<a hreef="#bib_4">4</a>. --><a id="ref0055"/><a href="#bib_4">Berdjas</a> D, Turina M.I. <cite><i>Operative Anatomy of the Heart</i></cite>. Berlin: Springer; 2011.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib5"><!--<a hreef="#bib_5">5</a>. --><a id="ref0060"/><a href="#bib_4">Deutsch</a> J, Savides T.J. <cite><i>Normal Thoracic Anatomy in Digital Human Anatomy and Endoscopic Ultrasonography</i></cite>. Hamilton, ON: BC Decker; 2005.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib6"><!--<a hreef="#bib_6">6</a>. --><a id="ref0065"/><a href="#bib_6">Kaiser</a> T, Kellenberger C.J, Albisetti M, et al. <cite>Normal values for aortic diameters in children and adolescents – assessment in vivo by contrast-enhanced CMR-angiography</cite>. <cite><i>J Cardiovasc Magn Reson</i></cite>. 2008;10:56.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib7"><!--<a hreef="#bib_7">7</a>. --><a id="ref0070"/><a href="#bib_7">Kervancioglu</a> P, Kervancioglu M, Tuncer C.M. <cite>Echocardiographic study of aortic root diameter in healthy children</cite>. <cite><i>Saudi Med J</i></cite>. 2006;27:27–30.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib8"><!--<a hreef="#bib_8">8</a>. --><a id="ref0075"/><a href="#bib_8">Liu</a> F, Ruze A, Amuti S, et al. <cite>A rare variation of the hemiazygos vein draining into the persistent left superior vena cava</cite>. <cite><i>Anat Sci Int</i></cite>. 2019;94(3):269–273.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib198"><!--<a hreef="#bib_198">198</a>. --><a id="ref0080"/><a href="#bib_198">Loukas</a> M, Groat C, Khangura R, et al. <cite>The normal and abnormal anatomy of the coronary arteries</cite>. <cite><i>Clin Anat</i></cite>. 2009;22:114–128.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib10"><!--<a hreef="#bib_10">10</a>. --><a id="ref0085"/><a href="#bib_10">Norton</a> J.A, Barie P.S, Bollinger R.R, et al. <cite><i>Surgery: Basic Science and Clinical Evidence</i></cite>. 2nd ed. New York: Springer; 2008.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib11"><!--<a hreef="#bib_11">11</a>. --><a id="ref0090"/><a href="#bib_11">Osborn</a> A.G. <cite><i>Diagnostic Cerebral Angiography</i></cite>. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams &amp;
