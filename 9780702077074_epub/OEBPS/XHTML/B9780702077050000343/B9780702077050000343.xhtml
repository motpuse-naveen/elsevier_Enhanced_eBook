This chapter considers the osteology of the external skull from anterior, posterior, superior, inferior and lateral views. Key stages in the development of the skull are documented from the newborn through to the attainment of adult morphology, including the postnatal growth and development of the calvarium, cranial base and facial skeleton. Anomalies of growth, including the appearance of sutural bones and the development of craniosynostosis are briefly considered along with other congenital abnormalities. Forensic identification from the skull is detailed in the context of sex, age and ancestry assessment, with the features commonly used in the estimation of the biological profile highlighted. Finally, the utility of forensic facial approximation, reconstruction and depiction in the identification process is summarized.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">age; ancestry; external skull; facial reconstruction; forensic; identification; osteology; sex</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The skull is the bony skeleton of the head. It houses the brain, the organs of special sense, and the upper parts of the respiratory and digestive systems and provides attachments for many of the muscles of the head and neck. Movement is restricted and is found only in relation to the mandible at the temporomandibular joint and at the atlanto-occipital joint for movement of the head in relation to the neck.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">The skull consists of the neurocranium, viscerocranium (facial skeleton) and mandible. The neurocranium may be subdivided into the calvaria (sometimes called the cranial vault) and the basicranium (also known as the cranial base). The neurocranium encloses the brain, intracranial portions of the cranial nerves, blood vessels, meninges and cerebrospinal fluid. Its walls are formed by parts of the frontal, ethmoid, parietal, sphenoid, temporal and occipital bones. The viscerocranium hangs down from the front of the neurocranium and houses the organs of sight, smell and taste, as well as the openings to the respiratory and digestive systems via the nose and mouth, respectively.</div><div class="text" id="p0020">Internally, the cranial base can be divided into three regions corresponding to the floor of the anterior, middle and posterior cranial fossae. In clinical parlance, the terms skull base and cranial base are frequently used as though they are synonymous. Indeed, inspection of the inferior surface of a skull confirms that the middle and posterior cranial bases are the same as the middle and posterior skull bases. However, the anterior cranial base and the anterior skull base should not be used interchangeably because the anterior skull base includes the inferior surface of the facial skeleton, whereas the internal surface of the anterior cranial base is the floor of the anterior cranial fossa and may be further subdivided into a midline (central) and two lateral parts. During development, the parts of the skull where the bones are derived by endochondral ossification constitute the chondrocranium; the remaining bones are derived by intramembranous ossification.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">The skull is the most complex bony structure in the body. The young adult skull is composed of an average of 28 separate bones, many of which are paired; some in the median plane are single, though symmetric. Most of the vault bones are flat and consist of two tables or plates of compact bone enclosing a narrow layer of relatively dense cancellous marrow (diploic bone). The marrow within the skull bones is a site of haemopoiesis, at least in the young individual. These bones form by intramembranous ossification of a highly vascular connective tissue membrane and have often been referred to as ‘dermal’ in deference to their alleged ancient phylogenetic origin. The inner table is thinner and more brittle while the outer tends to be thicker and more resilient; this is important to remember when examining fractures to the skull caused by either blunt or sharp trauma. This bone type is also of considerable value in cranial bone grafting in the young, where the two tables can be split to produce an autograft for use in maxillofacial reconstruction. The skull bones vary in thickness in different regions, with the bones of the viscerocranium being rather delicate and therefore particularly susceptible to fracture.</div><div class="text" id="p0030">The majority of bones in the skull articulate via fibrous joints called sutures, which facilitate growth rather than movement in the developing skull. The three main sutural morphologies reflect the magnitude of strain placed on them. Thus, the margins of adjacent bones of a suture may be smooth and meet end to end, giving a simple (butt-end) suture (e.g. median palatine suture); may be bevelled, so that the border of one bone overlaps the other (e.g. parietotemporal suture); or may present numerous projections that interlock, giving a serrated jigsaw appearance (e.g. lambdoid suture). The complexity of serrated sutures increases from the inner to the outer surface. Fusion across sutures (synostosis) can start early in the third decade, although its variability precludes using this information to assess age with any degree of accuracy. The process of fusion starts on the internal surface of the cranium first and proceeds externally; the coronal and sagittal sutures are often the first to display synostosis. By middle age, many of the larger sutures will show evidence of synostosis, although there are some that rarely show fusion, e.g. the zygomaticofacial. Premature fusion of sutures during the early growth phase of the skull (craniosynostosis) results in various abnormalities.</div><div class="text" id="p0035">The bones forming the base of the skull also play an important role in the overall growth of the face and the neurocranium. They develop mainly via endochondral ossification and the joints between most of them are primary cartilaginous joints. One of the most important is the spheno-occipital synchondrosis, between the body of the sphenoid anteriorly and the basilar part of the occipital bone posteriorly; fusion between them is generally completed between 13 and 18 years of age. Other joints include the occipital synchondroses and the jugular growth plate (or petro-exoccipital articulation).</div><div class="text" id="p0040">The two sites of synovial articulation associated with the exterior of the skull are the temporomandibular joint (between the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone and the condylar process of the mandible) and the atlanto-occipital joint (between the condyles of the occipital bone and the superior articular facets of the atlas). Movement at these joints does not facilitate rotation but participates in flexion and extension in the anteroposterior plane and bilateral flexion in the transverse plane.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">Many important neurological and vascular structures enter and exit the skull via foramina. The skull is often fractured following direct trauma. In addition to the main foramina, irregular emissary foramina allow veins situated externally on the face and scalp to communicate with those lying intracranially; spread of infection along these routes may have serious clinical consequences (e.g. cavernous sinus thrombosis).</div><div class="text" id="p0050">In the account of the skull that follows, only generalized standard views will be considered. A more detailed account of each individual bone will be found associated with the relevant regional text (<a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Berkovitz and Moxham 1994</a>).</div><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Frontal (Anterior) View</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0055">Viewed from the front, the skull is generally ovoid in shape and is wider above than below (<a href="#f0010">Fig. 34.1</a>). The upper part is formed by the frontal bone, which underlies the forehead region above the orbits. Superomedial to each orbit is a rounded superciliary arch (more pronounced in males), between which there may be a median elevation, the glabella. The glabella may show the remains of the interfrontal (metopic) suture, which usually closes in the first postnatal year (<a href="#bib52" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_52">Weinzweig et al 2003</a>) but persists in a small percentage of adult skulls in various ethnic groups. A retained interfrontal suture is usually present in the inferior portion of the suture, a feature known as metopism. The frontal bone articulates with the two nasal bones at the frontonasal sutures, which is marked by a depression at the root of the nose; the point at which the frontonasal and internasal sutures meet is the anthropometric landmark known as the nasion.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000343/main.assets/f34-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 34.1</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, The bones of the adult skull, frontal aspect. <span class="bold">B</span>, An anteroposterior radiograph of the skull and upper cervical spine, young adult.

Each orbital opening is roughly quadrangular in shape, although this can differ depending on ancestral origin (<a href="../B9780702077050000446/B9780702077050000446.xhtml">Ch. 44</a>). The upper, supraorbital, margin is formed entirely by the frontal bone, interrupted at the junction of its sharp lateral two-thirds and rounded medial third by the supraorbital notch or foramen, which transmits the supraorbital vessels and nerve. The lateral margin of the orbit is formed largely by the frontal process of the zygomatic bone and is completed above by the zygomatic process of the frontal bone; the frontozygomatic suture between them lies in a palpable depression. The infraorbital margin is formed by the zygomatic bone laterally and the maxilla medially. Both lateral and infraorbital margins are sharp and palpable. The medial margin of the orbit is formed above by the frontal bone and below by the lacrimal crest of the frontal process of the maxilla.</div><div class="text" id="p0065">The central part of the face is occupied mainly by the paired maxillae, separated by the anterior nasal aperture. Each maxilla contributes to the upper jaw, the floor and medial wall of the orbital cavity, the lateral wall of the nose, the floor of the nasal aperture and the bone of the cheek. The anterior nasal spine marks the upper limit of the intermaxillary suture at the lower margin of the anterior nasal aperture and is palpable in the nasal septum. The infraorbital foramen transmits the infraorbital vessels and nerve and lies about 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm below the middle of the infraorbital margin. The maxillary alveolar process bears the upper teeth. The short, thick zygomatic process of the maxilla has an oblique upper surface that <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="559" id="pagebreak_559"/><a id="pg559"/>articulates with the zygomatic bone at the zygomaticomaxillary suture. The frontal process of the maxilla ascends posterolateral to the nasal bone to articulate with it medially, the frontal bone superiorly and the lacrimal bone laterally.</div><div class="text" id="p0070">The anterior nasal aperture is piriform in shape, wider below than above and bounded by the paired nasal bones and maxillae. The upper boundary of the aperture is formed by the nasal bones while the remainder is formed by the maxillae. In life, several cartilages (septal, lateral nasal, major and minor alar) help to delineate two nasal cavities. The shape of these bones can be used quite successfully to predict the shape of the cartilaginous nose in forensic facial reconstructions (<a href="#bib56" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_56">Wilkinson and Rynn 2012</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0075">The lower part of the face, below the external nose, is formed from the alveolar arch of the maxillae and the upper dentition, and the body and alveolar process of the mandible and the lower dentition. In the midline, the mental protuberance produces the characteristic prominence of the chin. The mental foramen, which transmits the mental nerve and accompanying vessels, lies in the same vertical plane as the supraorbital and infraorbital foramina.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">Anteroposterior radiographs of the skull clearly show the central location of the paranasal air sinuses in the frontal bone, maxilla and ethmoid. The sinuses exhibit wide anatomical variations which can be useful indicators of identity when postmortem images are compared with antemortem clinical films.</div></section><section><a id="s0015"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0025">Posterior View</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0085">The parietal, temporal and occipital bones form the entirety of the posterior view (<a href="#f0015">Fig. 34.2</a>). The superolateral region is occupied by the parietal bones, the mastoid region of the temporal bones makes up the inferolateral regions, and the central portion is occupied by the squamous portion of the occipital bone, which is the reason why this aspect is also referred to as the occipital view. The parietal bones articulate with the occipital bone at the lambdoid suture, which extends inferiorly into the occipitomastoid and the parietomastoid sutures behind and above the mastoid processes, respectively. The lambda is the anthropometric point where the occipital bone meets the two parietal bones. Accessory sutural bones (or wormian bones) are islands of bone that may be found within a suture. They may arise from separate centres of ossification and they appear to have no clinical significance, being of genetic rather than pathological aetiology; their initial formation is thought to be caused by a degree of dural strain and increased sutural width (<a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_14">Bellary et al 2013</a>). They are most frequent in the lambdoid suture, which is the most tortuous of the sutures. However, they are also often observed within the sagittal and coronal sutures. A large, central interparietal bone is not uncommon and is sometimes referred to as an Inca bone (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 34.2</a>). Wormian bones are considered to be markers for various congenital diseases, including osteogenesis imperfecta and cleidocranial dysostosis.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000343/main.assets/f34-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 34.2</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, The bones of the adult skull, posterior aspect. <span class="bold">B</span>, Volume rendered CT of the head with a posteroanterior view of the skull. <br/><span class="figcredit">A, Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy © Elsevier GmbH, Urban &amp; Fischer, Munich.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0090">The external occipital protuberance is a midline elevation on the occipital bone that can become particularly well developed and palpable in males and is a marker for sex estimation. The location of the protuberance coincides with the anthropometric inion. Superior nuchal lines extend laterally from the protuberance and represent the boundary between the scalp and the neck. Inferior nuchal lines run parallel to, and below, the superior nuchal lines; a set of highest nuchal lines may sometimes develop above the superior lines. The external occipital protuberance, nuchal lines and roughened external surface of the occipital bone between the nuchal lines afford attachment to the muscles of the neck.</div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0030">Superior View</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0095">Seen from above, the contour of the calvaria varies greatly but is usually ellipsoid, or more strictly, a modified ovoid with its greatest width lying nearer to the occipital pole (<a href="#f0020">Fig. 34.3</a>). Four bones constitute this view and articulate via three well-defined sutures. The squamous part of the frontal bone is anterior, the squamous part of the occipital bone is posterior, and the two parietal bones meet in the midline separating the frontal from the occipital bone. The maximal parietal convexity on each site is palpable at the parietal tuber or eminence; it is most conspicuous in the female (retention of a paedomorphic appearance). The superior and inferior temporal lines run close to the parietal eminence but are best seen in a lateral view.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0020"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000343/main.assets/f34-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0020"/><a id="fspara0020"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 34.3</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, The bones of the adult skull, superior aspect. <span class="bold">B</span>, Volume rendered CT of the head with a superior view of the skull. <br/><span class="figcredit">A, Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy © Elsevier GmbH, Urban &amp; Fischer, Munich.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0100">The coronal suture marks the articulation between the posterior margin of the frontal bone and the anterior margins of the two parietal bones.

The upper temporal fossa is bounded inferiorly by the zygomatic arch, superiorly and posteriorly by the temporal lines, and anteriorly by the frontal process of the zygomatic bone. It is continuous inferiorly with the infratemporal fossa deep to the zygomatic arch. The temporal lines often present anteriorly as distinct ridges but become much less prominent as they arch posteriorly across the parietal bone. The inferior temporal line becomes more prominent as it curves down the posterior part of the squamous temporal bone, forming a supramastoid crest at the base of the mastoid process. The superior temporal line gives attachment to the temporal fascia while the inferior temporal line provides attachment for temporalis.</div><div class="text" id="p0125">The floor of the temporal fossa is formed by the frontal and parietal bones superiorly and the greater wing of the sphenoid and squamous part of the temporal bone inferiorly. All four bones of one side meet at a roughly H-shaped sutural junction called the pterion. This is an important anthropometric landmark because it commonly overlies both the anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery and the lateral fissure of the cerebral hemisphere (<a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Ma et al 2012</a>). The pterion corresponds to the site of the anterolateral (sphenoidal) fontanelle of the neonatal skull, which closes in the third month after birth.</div><div class="text" id="p0130">The vertical suture between the sphenoid and temporal bones, the sphenosquamosal suture, is formed by articulation between the posterior border of the greater wing of the sphenoid and the anterior border of the squamous part of the temporal bone.</div><div class="text" id="p0135">The lateral surface of the ramus of the mandible will be described briefly here because it lies within the middle region of this view of the skull. The ramus is a plate of bone projecting upwards from the body of the mandible; its lateral surface gives attachment to masseter. The ramus bears two prominent processes superiorly, the coronoid process anteriorly and the condylar process posteriorly, separated by the mandibular notch. The coronoid process is the site of insertion of temporalis; the condylar process articulates with the mandibular (glenoid) fossa of the temporal bone at the temporomandibular joint. The inferior and posterior borders of the mandible meet at the angle; it is more commonly splayed in the male, reflecting the larger site of attachment for medial pterygoid on the internal surface.</div><div class="text" id="p0140">The zygomatic arch stands proud of the rest of the skull, and the temporal and infratemporal fossae communicate via the gap thus created. In life, this space is largely filled by temporalis. The zygomatic bone is the principal bone of the cheek together with the zygomatic processes of the maxilla and temporal bones. The term ‘zygomatic arch’ is generally restricted to the temporal process of the zygomatic bone and the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, which articulate at the zygomaticotemporal suture. The suture between the zygomatic process of the frontal bone and the frontal process of the zygomatic bone is the frontozygomatic suture; the suture between the maxillary margin of the zygomatic bone and the zygomatic process of the maxilla is the zygomaticomaxillary suture; and the suture between the sphenoid and zygomatic bones is the sphenozygomatic suture. As the zygomatic process of the temporal bone passes posteriorly, it widens to form the articular eminence (tubercle) of the mandibular fossa anteriorly.</div><div class="text" id="p0145">The temporal bone is a prominent structure on the lateral aspect of the skull. Its squamous part lies in the floor of the upper temporal fossa and its zygomatic process contributes to the structure of the cheek. Additional components visible in the lateral view of the skull are the mandibular fossa and its articular eminence, the tympanic plate, the external acoustic meatus (external auditory meatus), and the mastoid and styloid processes. The mandibular fossa is bounded in front by the articular eminence and behind by the tympanic plate. The articular eminence provides a surface over which the mandibular condyle glides during mandibular movements and acts to prevent dislocation of the temporomandibular joint. The tympanic plate of the temporal bone contributes most of the margin of the external acoustic meatus; the squamous part forms the posterosuperior region. The external margin is roughened to provide an attachment for the cartilaginous part of the meatus. A small depression, the suprameatal triangle, lies above and behind the meatus and is related to the lateral wall of the mastoid antrum. The mastoid process is an inferior projection of the temporal bone. It lies posteroinferior to the external acoustic meatus and is the site of attachment of sternocleidomastoid. It is in contact behind with the posteroinferior angle of the parietal bone at the parietomastoid suture and with the squamous part of the occipital bone at the occipitomastoid suture. These two sutures meet the lateral end of the lambdoid suture at the asterion. This coincides with the site of the posterolateral fontanelle in the neonatal skull, which closes during the second year. A mastoid foramen may be found near, or in, the occipitomastoid suture; it transmits an emissary vein from the sigmoid sinus. Sutural bones may appear in the parietomastoid suture.</div><div class="text" id="p0150">The styloid process lies anterior and medial to the mastoid process and gives attachment to several muscles and ligaments. Its base is partly ensheathed by the tympanic plate and it descends anteromedially, its tip usually reaching a point medial to the posterior margin of the mandibular ramus. The styloid process is very variably developed. Its length ranges from a few millimetres to a few centimetres and increases with age (<a href="#bib32" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_32">Krmpotić Nemanić et al 2009</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0155">The infratemporal fossa is an irregular, postmaxillary space deep to the ramus of the mandible. It communicates with the upper temporal fossa deep to the zygomatic arch. It is best visualized when the mandible is removed but, for completeness, is considered here. Its roof is the infratemporal surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid, the lateral pterygoid plate lies medially, and the ramus of the mandible and styloid process lie laterally and posteriorly, respectively. The infratemporal fossa has no anatomical floor. Its anterior and medial walls are separated above by the pterygomaxillary fissure lying between the lateral pterygoid plate and the posterior wall of the maxilla. The infratemporal fossa communicates with the pterygopalatine fossa through the pterygomaxillary fissure.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="562" id="pagebreak_562"/><a id="pg562"/></div></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0040">Inferior View</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0160">With the mandible removed, the inferior surface of the skull extends from the upper incisor teeth anteriorly to the superior nuchal lines of the occipital bone posteriorly (<a href="#f0030">Fig. 34.5</a>). The region contains many of the foramina through which structures enter and exit the cranial cavity. The inferior surface may be conveniently subdivided into anterior, middle, posterior and lateral parts. The anterior part contains the hard palate and the dentition of the maxillary arch and lies at a lower level than the rest of the cranial base. The middle and posterior parts may be arbitrarily divided by a transverse plane passing through the anterior margin of the foramen magnum. The middle part is occupied mainly by the sphenoid bone, the apices of the petrous processes of the temporal bones, and the basilar part of the occipital bone. The lateral part contains the zygomatic arches, mandibular fossae, tympanic plates, the styloid and mastoid processes. The posterior part lies in the midline and is formed almost exclusively from the occipital bone. Whereas the middle and posterior parts are directly related to the cranial cavity (the middle and posterior cranial fossae), the anterior part is some distance from the anterior cranial fossa, being separated from it by the nasal cavities.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0030"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000343/main.assets/f34-05-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0030"/><a id="fspara0030"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 34.5</span> The external surface of the base of the adult skull. <br/><span class="figcredit">Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy © Elsevier GmbH, Urban &amp; Fischer, Munich.</span></figcaption></figure></div><section><a id="s0035"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0045">Anterior part of inferior surface</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0165">The bony palate within the superior alveolar arch is formed by the palatine processes of the maxillae anteriorly and the horizontal plates of the palatine bones posteriorly, all meeting at a cruciform system of sutures (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 34.5</a>). The median palatine suture runs anteroposteriorly and divides the palate into right and left halves. This suture is continuous with the intermaxillary suture between the maxillary central incisor teeth. The transverse palatine (palatomaxillary) sutures run transversely across the palate between the maxillae and the palatine bones. The palate is arched sagittally and transversely; its depth and breadth are variable but are always greatest in the molar region. The incisive fossa lies behind the central incisor teeth, and the lateral incisive foramina, through which incisive canals pass to the nasal cavity, lie in its lateral walls. Median incisive foramina are present in some skulls and open on to the anterior and posterior walls of the fossa. The incisive fossa transmits the nasopalatine nerve and the termination of the greater palatine vessels. When <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="564" id="pagebreak_564"/><a id="pg564"/>median incisive foramina are present, the left nasopalatine nerve usually traverses the anterior foramen and the right nerve traverses the posterior foramen. The greater palatine foramen lies near the lateral palatal border of the transverse palatine suture; a vascular groove, deeper behind and shallower in front, leads forwards from the foramen. The lesser palatine foramina, usually two, lie behind the greater palatine foramen and pierce the pyramidal process of the palatine bone, which is wedged between the lower ends of the medial and lateral pterygoid plates. The palate is pierced by many other small foramina and is marked by pits for palatine glands. Variably prominent palatine crests extend medially from behind the greater palatine foramina. The posterior border projects back as the posterior nasal spine. In the adult, the alveolar arch normally bears a maximum of 16 sockets or alveoli for the teeth; the sockets vary in size and depth. Some are single and some are subdivided by septa, according to the morphology of the dental roots.</div><div class="text" id="p0170">The nasal fossae lie above the hard palate and are separated by the nasal septum in the midline. The bony nasal septum is formed from the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid superiorly and the vomer inferiorly. The upper border of the vomer approximates to the inferior aspect of the body of the sphenoid, where it expands into an ala on each side. The two posterior nasal apertures (choanae) are located at the end of the nasal fossae; they are separated by the free posterior border of the vomer and bounded below by the posterior border of the horizontal plates of the palatine bones, above by the sphenoid and laterally by the medial pterygoid plates.</div></section><section><a id="s0040"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0050">Middle part of inferior surface</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0175">The middle part of the inferior surface is made up from the sphenoid, petrous parts of the temporal bones and the basiocciput (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 34.5</a>). It extends from the posterior nares anteriorly to an artificial line drawn transversely through the anterior margin of the foramen magnum posteriorly. In the adult, the body of the sphenoid fuses with the basiocciput, at the spheno-occipital synchondrosis, to form a midline bar of bone that extends posteriorly to the foramen magnum (internally, this is known as the clivus). The basiocciput bears a small midline pharyngeal tubercle, which gives attachment to the pharyngeal raphe, the highest attachment of the superior pharyngeal constrictor.</div><div class="text" id="p0180">The petrous processes of the two temporal bones pass from the lateral sides of the base of the skull and fill the triangular space between the greater wing of the sphenoid anteriorly and the lateral margins of the basiocciput posteriorly. Each petrous process meets the basilar part of the occipital bone at a petro-occipital junction, which is deficient posteriorly at the jugular foramen. The petrosphenoidal junction and the groove for the pharyngotympanic tube lie between the petrous process and the infratemporal surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid. The apex of the petrous process does not meet the spheno-occipital synchondrosis; the deficit so produced is the foramen lacerum.</div><div class="text" id="p0185">Pterygoid processes descend from the junction between the greater wing and body of the sphenoid, separated by a pterygoid fossa. Anteriorly, the plates are fused, except inferiorly, where they are separated by the pyramidal process of the palatine bone. Sutures are usually discernible at this site in young skulls. Laterally, the pterygoid plates are separated from the posterior maxillary surface by the pterygomaxillary fissure, which leads into the pterygopalatine fossa. The posterior border of the medial pterygoid plate is sharp, and bears a small projection near the midpoint, above which it is curved and attached to the pharyngeal end of the pharyngotympanic tube. Above, the medial pterygoid plate divides to enclose the scaphoid fossa. Below, it projects as a slender pterygoid hamulus, which curves laterally and is grooved anteriorly by the tendon of tensor veli palatini. The pterygoid hamulus gives origin to the pterygomandibular raphe. The lateral pterygoid plate projects posterolaterally and its lateral surface forms the medial wall of the infratemporal fossa. Superiorly and laterally, the pterygoid process is continuous with the infratemporal surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone, which forms part of the roof of the infratemporal fossa. This surface forms the posterolateral border of the inferior orbital fissure and bears an infratemporal crest associated with the origin of the upper part of lateral pterygoid. The infraorbital and zygomatic branches of the maxillary nerve and accompanying vessels pass through the inferior orbital fissure. Laterally, the greater wing of the sphenoid articulates with the squamous part of the temporal bone.</div><div class="text" id="p0190">The medial aspect of the greater wing of the sphenoid presents a crescent of foramina of which only the most posterior two, foramen ovale and foramen spinosum, can be viewed on the basal aspect. The foramen ovale lies medial to the foramen spinosum and lateral to the foramen lacerum on the infratemporal surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. It transmits the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, the lesser petrosal nerve, the accessory meningeal branch of the maxillary artery and an emissary vein that connects the cavernous venous sinus to the pterygoid venous plexus in the infratemporal fossa. Posterolaterally, the smaller and rounder foramen spinosum transmits the middle meningeal artery and a recurrent meningeal branch of the mandibular nerve. The irregular spine of the sphenoid projects posterolateral to the foramen spinosum. The medial surface of the spine is flat and, with the adjoining posterior border of the greater wing of the sphenoid, forms the anterolateral wall of a groove that is completed posteromedially by the petrous part of the temporal bone. This groove, the auditory sulcus, contains the cartilaginous pharyngotympanic tube, which leads posterolaterally into the bony portion of the tube that lies within the petrous part of the temporal bone. Occasionally, the foramen ovale and foramen spinosum are confluent or the posterior edge of the foramen spinosum may be defective. A small foramen, the sphenoidal emissary foramen (of Vesalius), is sometimes found between the foramen ovale and scaphoid fossa. When present, it contains an emissary vein linking the pterygoid venous plexus in the infratemporal fossa with the cavernous sinus in the middle cranial fossa.</div><div class="text" id="p0195">The foramen lacerum is bounded in front by the body and adjoining roots of the pterygoid process and greater wing of the sphenoid bone; posterolaterally, by the apex of the petrous part of the temporal bone; and medially, by the basilar part of the occipital bone. Although nearly 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm long, it is not traversed by any major structure. The almost circular carotid canal lies behind and posterolateral to the foramen lacerum in the petrous part of the temporal bone. The internal carotid artery enters the skull through this foramen, ascends in the carotid canal, and turns anteromedially to reach the posterior wall of the foramen lacerum. It ascends through the upper end of the foramen lacerum, accompanied by venous and sympathetic nerve plexuses. Meningeal branches of the ascending pharyngeal artery and emissary veins from the cavernous sinus also traverse the foramen lacerum. In life, the lower part of the foramen lacerum is partially occluded by cartilaginous remnants of the embryological chondrocranium. The pterygoid canal can be seen on the base of the skull at the anterior margin of the foramen lacerum, above and between the pterygoid plates of the sphenoid bone. It leads into the pterygopalatine fossa and transmits the nerve of the pterygoid canal and accompanying blood vessels.</div></section><section><a id="s0045"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0055">Posterior part of inferior surface</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0200">The posterior part of the inferior surface of the skull is predominantly formed by the occipital bone (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 34.5</a>). Prominent features are the foramen magnum and associated occipital condyles, jugular foramen, mastoid notch and the squamous part of the occipital bone up to the external occipital protuberance and the superior nuchal lines, hypoglossal canals (anterior condylar canals) and condylar canals (posterior condylar canals).</div><div class="text" id="p0205">The foramen magnum lies in an anteromedian position and leads into the posterior cranial fossa. It is oval and wider behind, with its greatest diameter being anteroposterior. It contains the lower end of the medulla oblongata, meninges, cerebrospinal fluid, vertebral arteries and veins, and the accessory nerves; the apical ligament of the dens and the tectorial membrane pass through it to attach to the internal basiocciput. Anteriorly, the margin of the foramen magnum is slightly overlapped by the occipital condyles, which project down to articulate with the superior articular facets on the lateral masses of the atlas. Each occipital condyle is oval in outline and orientated obliquely so that its anterior end lies nearer the midline than its posterior end. It is markedly convex anteroposteriorly, less so transversely, and its medial aspect is roughened by ligamentous attachments. The hypoglossal canal is directed laterally and slightly forwards, traverses deep to each condyle and transmits the hypoglossal nerve, a meningeal branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery and an emissary vein from the basilar plexus. A depression, the condylar fossa, lies immediately posterior to the condyle and may contain a (posterior) condylar canal for an emissary vein from the sigmoid sinus. This fossa accommodates the posterior margin of the atlas when the head is fully extended. A jugular process articulates with the petrous part of the temporal bone lateral to each condyle and its anterior free border forms the posterior boundary of the jugular foramen.</div><div class="text" id="p0210">Laterally, the occipital bone approximates with the petrous part of the temporal bone anteriorly at the petro-occipital junction, and the mastoid process of the temporal bone more posteriorly at the occipitomastoid suture. The jugular foramen, a large, asymmetric and irregular hiatus, lies at the posterior end of the petro-occipital junction between the jugular process of the occipital bone and the jugular fossa of the petrous part of the temporal bone (see <a href="../B9780702077050000422/B9780702077050000422.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 42.1C</a>) (<a href="#bib50" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_50">Vogl and Bisdas 2009</a>).

A mastoid canaliculus runs through the lateral wall of the jugular fossa and transmits the auricular branch of the vagus nerve. The canaliculus for the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve lies on the ridge between the jugular fossa and the opening of the carotid canal. A small notch, related to the inferior glossopharyngeal ganglion, may be found medially on the upper boundary of the jugular foramen (it is more easily identified internally). The orifice of the cochlear canaliculus may be found at the apex of the notch.</div><div class="text" id="p0215">The squamous part of the occipital bone exhibits the external occipital protuberance, supreme, superior and inferior nuchal lines, and the external occipital crest, all of which lie in the midline, posterior to the foramen magnum.

The anterior structures have been considered earlier in this chapter.</div><div class="text" id="p0225">The mandibular fossa is a thin-walled, smooth, concave depression in the temporal bone and is most easily inspected when the mandible is removed. The zygomatic arch extends laterally in front of the fossa and a distinct ridge, the articular eminence, lies anterior to the fossa. Three fissures can be distinguished behind the mandibular fossa. The squamotympanic fissure extends from the spine of the sphenoid, between the mandibular fossa and the tympanic plate of the temporal bone, and curves up the anterior margin of the external acoustic meatus. A thin wedge of bone forming the inferior margin of the tegmen tympani lies within the fissure and divides the squamotympanic fissure into petrotympanic and petrosquamous fissures. The petrotympanic fissure transmits the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve from the intracranial cavity into the infratemporal fossa. The tympanic plate forms the floor of the external acoustic meatus.</div><div class="text" id="p0230">The stylomastoid foramen lies between the mastoid and styloid processes on the lateral aspect of the temporal bone.

The distance from the styloid process to the stylomastoid foramen decreases with age (<a href="#bib32" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Krmpotić Nemanić et al 2009</a>). A groove, the mastoid notch, lies medial to the mastoid process and gives origin to the posterior belly of digastric. A groove related to the occipital artery often lies medial to the mastoid notch. A mastoid foramen may be present near, or in, the occipitomastoid suture; when present, it transmits an emissary vein from the sigmoid sinus. The external acoustic meatus lies in front of the mastoid process. It is surrounded inferiorly by the tympanic plate, which partly ensheathes the base of the styloid process as the vaginal process.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0055"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0065">Internal Surface of Calvaria</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0235">The internal surface of the calvaria is deeply concave and includes most of the frontal and parietal bones and the squamous part of the occipital bone, variously united at the coronal, sagittal and lambdoid sutures (<a href="#f0035">Fig. 34.6</a>).

Olfactory nerves pass from the nasal mucosa to the olfactory bulb of the brain through numerous small foramina in the cribriform plate. Anteriorly, a spur of bone, the crista galli, projects upwards between the cerebral hemispheres and serves as an attachment for the falx cerebri. A depression between the crista galli and the crest of the frontal bone is crossed by the frontoethmoidal suture. It bears the foramen caecum, which is usually a small blind-ended depression formed by the developmental involution of a dural diverticulum that extends through the foramen caecum to the columella; in adults, it occasionally accommodates a vein draining from the nasal mucosa to the superior sagittal sinus. Failure of the foramen caecum to close may cause nasal dermoid cysts and nasoethmoidal encephaloceles in children.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="566" id="pagebreak_566"/><a id="pg566"/></div><div class="text" id="p0265">The anterior ethmoidal nerve and vessels enter the cranial cavity where the cribriform plate meets the orbital part of the frontal bone. They then pass into the roof of the nasal cavity via a small foramen by the side of the crista galli. The posterior ethmoidal canal, which transmits the posterior ethmoidal nerve and vessels, opens at the junction of the posterolateral corner of the cribriform plate and jugum sphenoidale. The convex orbital plate of the frontal bone separates the brain from the orbit and bears impressions of cerebral gyri and small grooves for meningeal vessels. Posteriorly, it articulates with the anterior border of the lesser wing of the sphenoid laterally and the jugum sphenoidale medially. The jugum sphenoidale is a flat surface on the upper aspect of the sphenoid bone that connects the two lesser wings, also known as the planum sphenoidale. The limbus of the sphenoid bone is a prominent ridge on the body of the sphenoid that forms the posterior border of the jugum sphenoidale and the anterior border of the prechiasmatic sulcus. The latter is an osseous groove that runs transversely between the optic canals. The optic chiasma usually lies above the prechiasmatic sulcus, while the medial orbital surface of the frontal lobes and olfactory tracts lie above the jugum sphenoidale (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 34.7</a>.)</div><div class="text" id="p0270">The posterior boundary of the lesser wing forms the posterior boundary of the anterior cranial fossa; the medial end of the lesser wing constitutes the anterior clinoid process. The lesser wing and the anterior clinoid process join the sphenoid body by two roots that are separated by the optic canal. The anterior root, broad and flat, forms the roof of the optic canal and is continuous with the jugum sphenoidale, while the smaller and thicker posterior root, also known as the optic strut, joins the body of the sphenoid bone at the lateral aspect of the posterior bank of the prechiasmatic sulcus or tuberculum sellae (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 34.7</a>). The optic strut of the anterior clinoid process separates the optic canal from the superior orbital fissure (<a href="#bib30" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_30">Kerr et al 2012</a>).

The fissures contain the oculomotor, trochlear and abducens nerves, and the lacrimal, frontal and nasociliary branches of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, together with filaments from the internal carotid plexus (postganglionic sympathetic), the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins, the orbital branch of the middle meningeal artery, and the recurrent branch of the lacrimal artery.</div><div class="text" id="p0285">The central part of the cranial base, located between both middle cranial fossae, is formed by the body of the sphenoid bone, which contains the sphenoidal sinuses. The body of the sphenoid bone is deeply concave and houses the pituitary gland (hypophysis); it is therefore termed the pituitary (hypophysial) fossa, also known as the sella turcica because it resembles the shape of a Turkish saddle (<a href="#bib37" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_37">Paluzzi et al 2012</a>). The face and floor of the sella turcica are located within the sphenoidal air sinuses, which is why the most direct surgical route to the pituitary fossa is the trans-sphenoidal approach. The anterior edge of the sella is formed by a bony prominence, the tuberculum sellae, which is continuous anteriorly with the prechiasmatic sulcus; the posterior boundary presents a vertical pillar of bone, the dorsum sellae. The superolateral angles of the dorsum are expanded as the posterior clinoid processes. A fold of dura, the diaphragma sellae, is attached to the anterior and posterior clinoid processes and roofs over the pituitary fossa. The cavernous sinus lies lateral to the pituitary fossa. The lateral wall of the body of the sphenoid contains a shallow carotid sulcus related to the internal carotid artery as it ascends from the carotid canal and runs through the cavernous sinus.</div><div class="text" id="p0290">Each anterior clinoid process covers the roof of the cavernous sinus and the paraclinoidal segment of the internal carotid artery as it leaves the cavernous sinus and pierces the dura to enter the intradural space. The anterior clinoid process gives attachment to the anterior petroclinoidal ligament, which forms the free margin of the tentorium cerebelli, and the interclinoidal ligament, which lies between the anterior and posterior clinoids. The middle clinoid process arises from the body of the sphenoid <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="567" id="pagebreak_567"/><a id="pg567"/>bone at the anterolateral margin of the sella turcica and may be connected to the anterior clinoid process by a thin osseous bar, formed by ossification of the caroticoclinoid ligament. The resulting caroticoclinoid foramen or ring surrounds the paraclinoidal segment of the internal carotid artery (<a href="#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_21">Fernandez-Miranda et al 2012</a>). While anterior and posterior clinoids are always present, middle clinoids are not constant. A recent study revealed that the middle clinoid process was usually identifiable in fine-cut head computed tomogram–angiogram scans, and sometimes had at least one caroticoclinoid ring.</div><div class="text" id="p0295">The greater wing of the sphenoid bone contains three consistent foramina and other small variable foramina. The foramen rotundum, situated just below the medial end of the superior orbital fissure, leads forwards into the medial aspect of the inferior orbital fissure and opens into the pterygopalatine fossa; it contains the maxillary nerve (second division of trigeminal nerve).</div><div class="text" id="p0300">Behind the foramen rotundum is the foramen ovale, which transmits the mandibular nerve (third division of trigeminal nerve). The foramen spinosum lies just posterolateral to the foramen ovale and transmits the middle meningeal artery and veins; these vessels groove the floor and lateral wall of the middle cranial fossa. The foramen ovale and foramen spinosum open into the underlying infratemporal fossa. When present, the small sphenoidal emissary foramen lies anteromedial to the foramen ovale and lateral to the foramen rotundum; it transmits an emissary vein through which the cavernous sinus and pterygoid plexus communicate.</div><div class="text" id="p0305">The foramen lacerum is a misnomer because it is a gap, not a true foramen, formed by the incomplete confluence of the pterygosphenoidal and petroclival fissures. It may therefore also be called the sphenopetroclival synchondrosis. It lies posteromedial to the foramen ovale at the transition between the carotid sulcus of the sphenoid bone and the petrous carotid canal, bounded laterally by the lingula of the sphenoid and the petrolingual ligament extending to the petrous apex. The lower portion of the foramen lacerum is filled with fibrocartilage extending from the pterygosphenoidal fissure, pharyngotympanic tube and basopharyngeal fascia. The upper portion of the foramen contains the laceral segment of the internal carotid artery and should be considered as the rostral extension of the petrous carotid canal (<a href="#bib48" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_48">Tauber et al 1999</a>). The only structures that enter or exit the intracranial cavity through the foramen lacerum are the pterygoid (Vidian) nerve and vessels, terminal branches of the ascending pharyngeal artery and small emissary veins connecting the extracranial pterygoid plexus with the intracranial cavernous sinus.</div><div class="text" id="p0310">The superior border of the petrous part of the temporal bone separates the middle and the posterior cranial fossae, and is grooved by the superior petrosal sinus. The trigeminal impression, which accommodates the trigeminal ganglion, is situated on the anterior surface of the petrous part of the temporal bone near its apex. A smooth trigeminal notch leads into the impression and lies on the upper border of the petrous part, anteromedial to the groove for the superior petrosal sinus. At the level of the notch, the trigeminal nerve passes from the posterior to the middle cranial fossa, and separates the superior petrosal sinus from the underlying bone. The petrosphenoidal ligament (of Gruber) lies at the anterior end of the trigeminal notch, attached to a minute bony spicule, the petrous tubercle (<a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_26">Iaconetta et al 2003</a>). The ligament runs in a superior, anterior and medial direction to attach to the posterior and lateral aspect of the posterior clinoid. The abducens nerve bends sharply across the upper petrous border and medially over the lateral edge of the dorsum sellae or petrosal process of the sphenoid, and typically passes under the petrosphenoidal ligament to enter the cavernous sinus (<a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">Ozveren et al 2002</a>). This interdural space (between dural layers), limited superiorly by the petrosphenoidal ligament, inferiorly by the petrosal process, laterally by the petrous apex, and medially by the dorsum sellae, is known as Dorello’s canal (<a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Ambekar et al 2012</a>). It is also defined as the petroclival venous confluence because it is filled with blood from the adjacent venous sinuses, namely: the inferior and superior petrosal, cavernous and basilar plexus (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Barges-Coll et al 2010</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0315">Lateral to the trigeminal impression, a narrow groove passes posterolaterally into the hiatus for the greater petrosal nerve (also known as the facial hiatus); the hiatus and groove for the lesser petrosal nerve lies even further laterally (<a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_28">Kakizawa et al 2007</a>). Posterolateral to the facial hiatus, a rounded arcuate eminence is produced by the underlying superior semicircular canal. A line bisecting the angle subtended by the arcuate eminence and the greater petrosal nerve estimates the location of the roof of the internal acoustic meatus (internal auditory canal) in the middle fossa. The petrous segment of the internal carotid artery runs from the carotid foramen to the foramen lacerum within the carotid canal of the petrous part of the temporal bone. The greater petrosal nerve travels above and parallel to the petrous carotid canal, which may be dehiscent. The osseous portion of the pharyngotympanic tube and tensor tympani run parallel and just lateral to the petrous carotid canal within the floor of the middle fossa. The cochlea is situated within the petrous part of the temporal bone, just medial to the posterior aspect of the petrous carotid canal and anterior to the internal acoustic meatus and arcuate eminence. The portion of petrous bone that is limited anteriorly by the mandibular nerve, laterally by the greater petrosal nerve, medially by the superior petrosal sinus, and posteriorly by the internal acoustic meatus and cochlea is named the posteromedial (or Kawase’s) triangle of the middle fossa.

Chronically elevated intracranial pressure may cause erosion of the tegmen tympani and spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid otorrhoea. The posterior part of the tegmen tympani forms the roof of the mastoid antrum, lateral to the arcuate eminence, and is also called the tegmen mastoideum. In young skulls, a petrosquamous suture may be visible at the lateral limit of the tegmen tympani but it is obliterated in adults. The tegmen tympani then turns down as the lateral wall of the osseous portion of the pharyngotympanic tube, and its lower border may appear in the squamotympanic fissure.

It is bounded in front by the dorsum sellae, posterior aspects of the body of the sphenoid bone, and the basilar (or clival) part of the occipital bone; behind by the squamous part of the occipital bone; and laterally by the petrous and mastoid parts of the temporal bones and by the lateral (condylar) parts of the occipital bone.</div><div class="text" id="p0330">The most prominent feature in the floor of the posterior cranial fossa is the foramen magnum in the occipital bone. The medulla oblongata exits the cranial cavity through the foramen magnum to continue as the spinal cord (see <a href="../B9780702077050000355/B9780702077050000355.xhtml#f0060">Fig. 35.11</a>). The cerebellum is fully contained within the posterior fossa. When the lower part of the cerebellum, the tonsils, descend abnormally through the foramen magnum, they may cause compression of the medulla at the level of the foramen magnum, a condition called tonsillar herniation or Chiari malformation.</div><div class="text" id="p0335">The clivus is a sloping surface that extends from the sella turcica to the foramen magnum, and is formed successively by the dorsum sellae, the posterior part of the body of the sphenoid and the basilar (clival) part of the occipital bone. The spheno-occipital synchondrosis is evident on the clivus of a growing child but not in adults. The clivus is located at the centre of the posterior skull base and separates the nasopharynx from the posterior cranial fossa. Cranial chordomas are malignant tumours that histologically are reminiscent of embryonic notochordal tissue and typically arise within the clival bone (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Fernandez-Miranda et al 2014</a>).

The intracranial margins of the fissure are grooved by the inferior petrosal sinus. Chondrosarcomas are malignant tumours composed of transformed cells that produce cartilage; their most common intracranial location is precisely the petroclival fissure.</div><div class="text" id="p0340">The jugular foramen is a large opening located between the temporal and occipital bones at the posterior end of the petro-occipital fissure, above and lateral to the foramen magnum. The lower border of the jugular foramen is smooth and is formed by the lateral part of the occipital bone. The upper border is sharp and irregular, and is formed by the petrous part of the temporal bone. It contains a notch, the intrajugular process, which divides the foramen into a large posterolateral compartment, the sigmoid part, which receives the drainage of the sigmoid sinus; and a small anteromedial compartment, the petrosal part, which receives the drainage of the inferior petrosal sinus. The accessory, vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves course in the medial side of the intrajugular process; they lie between the petrosal part (which contains the inferior petrosal sinus accompanied by a meningeal branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery) and the sigmoid part (which contains the sigmoid sinus accompanied by a meningeal branch of the occipital artery). The cochlear canaliculus or aqueduct, which contains the perilymphatic ‘duct’, is sited in the deepest part of the intrajugular process. The jugular foramina are <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="568" id="pagebreak_568"/><a id="pg568"/>typically asymmetric: the right foramen is usually larger than the left, reflecting the right dominance of the sigmoid sinus and jugular vein.</div><div class="text" id="p0345">The jugular tubercle is a rounded prominence located at the junction of the basilar and lateral parts of the occipital bone, just medial to the jugular foramen. The accessory, vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves cross the posterior portion of the tubercle on their way to the jugular foramen.

The canal may be divided by bony septa for different rootlets of the hypoglossal nerve. The occipital condyles form the lateral (or condylar) part of the occipital bone, and they lie within the anterior and lateral aspect of the foramen magnum. On each side, their medial surface bears a tubercle that gives attachments to the alar ligaments of the odontoid process, and their inferior surface is convex and articulates with the upper surface of the lateral mass of the atlas. The posterior condylar canal, when present, is located in the extracranial surface behind and above each occipital condyle; its internal orifice is posterolateral to that of the hypoglossal canal and contains the supracondylar vein and a meningeal branch of the occipital artery.</div><div class="text" id="p0350">The posterior surface of the petrous part of the temporal bone forms much of the anterolateral wall of the posterior cranial fossa.

A small subarcuate fossa lined with dura mater lies posteriorly between the internal acoustic meatus and the opening of the vestibular aqueduct. It houses the saccus and ductus endolymphaticus and a small artery and vein. The suprameatal tubercle is a bony prominence located superiorly between the internal acoustic meatus and the petrous ridge (<a href="#bib43" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_43">Seoane and Rhoton 1999</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0355">The mastoid part of the temporal bone lies behind the petrous part of the temporal bone in the lateral wall of the posterior cranial fossa.

Superiorly, where the groove touches the mastoid angle of the parietal bone, it becomes continuous with a groove that transmits the transverse sinus, and then crosses the parietomastoid suture and descends behind the mastoid antrum. A mastoid foramen, which transmits an emissary vein from the sigmoid sinus and a meningeal branch of the occipital artery, may be sited here. The lowest part of the sigmoid sulcus crosses the occipitomastoid suture and grooves the jugular process of the occipital bone. The right sigmoid sulcus is usually larger than the left.</div><div class="text" id="p0360">The squamous part of the occipital bone displays a median internal occipital crest. This runs posteriorly from the foramen magnum to an internal occipital protuberance, gives attachment to the falx cerebelli, and may be grooved by the occipital sinus. The internal occipital protuberance is close to the confluence of the sinuses. It is grooved bilaterally by the transverse sinuses, which curve laterally with an upward convexity to the mastoid angles of the parietal bones. The groove for the transverse sinus is usually deeper on the right, where it is generally a continuation of the superior sagittal sinus, while on the left it is frequently a continuation of the straight sinus. On both sides, the transverse sulcus is continuous with the sigmoid sulcus. Below the transverse sulcus, the internal occipital crest separates two shallow fossae that house the cerebellar hemispheres.

The facial region is relatively small and constitutes only about one-eighth of the neonatal skull, whereas it constitutes about half of the adult skull (<a href="#f0160">Fig. 34.8</a>). Smallness of the face at birth is due mainly to the rudimentary stage of development of the mandible and maxillae; the teeth are unerupted and the maxillae are not yet pneumatized (invaded by air cells). The nose lies almost entirely between the orbits, and the lower border of the nasal aperture is only slightly lower in position than the orbital floors. Bones of the calvaria are unilaminar and lack diploë. Frontal and parietal tuberosities are prominent; in the frontal view, the greatest width occurs between the parietal tuberosities. The glabella, superciliary arches and mastoid processes are not developed and the cranial base is relatively short and narrow.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0160"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000343/main.assets/f34-08-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0060"/><a id="fspara0060"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 34.8</span> <span class="bold">A–D</span>, The neonatal skull: <span class="bold">A</span>, frontal aspect; <span class="bold">B</span>, lateral aspect; <span class="bold">C</span>, superior aspect; D, basal aspect. <br/><span class="figcredit">Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy © Elsevier GmbH, Urban &amp; Fischer, Munich.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0390">Ossification is incomplete, and many bones are still in several elements that are united by fibrous tissue or cartilage.

The two halves of the frontal bone and the mandible; the squamous, lateral and basilar parts of the occipital bone; and the petromastoid and squamotympanic parts of the temporal bone are all separate. The fibrous membrane within which the calvaria forms remains unossified at the six angles of the parietal bones, producing six fontanelles: two single midline (anterior and posterior) and two lateral pairs (sphenoidal/anterolateral and mastoid/posterolateral). The anterior fontanelle is the largest, measuring approximately 4 cm in anteroposterior and 2.5 cm in transverse dimensions. It occupies the junction between the sagittal, coronal and frontal sutures and is rhomboid in shape. The posterior fontanelle lies at the junction between the sagittal and lambdoid sutures and is triangular in shape. The sphenoidal (anterolateral) and mastoid (posterolateral) fontanelles are small and irregular in shape and lie at the sphenoidal and mastoid angles of the parietal bones, respectively.</div><div class="text" id="p0399">At birth, the orbits appear relatively large. The developing tooth germs are generally contained within the alveolar crypts, although eruption of the upper central incisor teeth can occur prior to, or shortly after, birth. Temporal bones differ greatly from their adult form. The internal ear, tympanic cavity, auditory ossicles and mastoid antrum are all almost adult in size, the tympanic plate is an incomplete ring that has usually started to fuse with the squamous part, and the mastoid process is absent. The external acoustic meatus is short, straight and wholly cartilaginous. The external aspect of the tympanic membrane faces more inferiorly than laterally, in accord with the basal cranial contour. The stylomastoid foramen is exposed on the lateral surface of the skull, the styloid process has not yet commenced ossification, the mandibular fossa is flat and more lateral, and its articular tubercle is undeveloped. The paranasal sinuses are rudimentary or absent and only the maxillary sinuses are usually identifiable.</div><div class="text" id="p0409">The skull is moulded by slow compression during vaginal birth. That part of the scalp that is more central in the birth canal is often temporarily oedematous (caput succedaneum) as a result of interference with venous return. Fontanelles and the openness and width of the sutures allow bones of the cranial vault some overlap during the process of birth; the skull is compressed in one plane with compensatory orthogonal elongation. These deformations disappear within the first week after birth.</div></section><section><a id="s0100"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0110">Postnatal growth</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0405">Although postnatal growth of the calvaria (cranial vault) and facial skeleton usually proceeds in a coordinated fashion, these regions exhibit different rates and temporal periods of expression. In general, early growth of the vault is largely influenced by cerebral maturation while growth of the facial skeleton responds to spatial requirement for the development of the teeth and the muscles of mastication. Growth of the cranial base is largely independent of both vault and facial development, and therefore the three regions will be considered separately.

For most of this period, expansion is largely <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="569" id="pagebreak_569"/><a id="pg569"/>concentric; overall form is determined early in the first year and remains largely unaltered thereafter. However, the shape of the vault is not solely related to cerebral growth, but is also influenced by genetic factors that manifest in an extensive range of shapes and sizes that may be sufficient to allow an evaluation of ethnic origin. During the first and early second years, growth occurs primarily through ossification at apposed margins of bones (which possess an osteogenic layer), accompanied by some accretion and absorption of bone at surfaces in order to adapt to continually altering curvatures. Growth in breadth is said to take place at the sagittal, sphenofrontal, sphenotemporal, occipitomastoid and petro-occipital junctions, while growth in height is said to occur at the frontozygomatic and squamosal sutures, pterion and asterion. During this period, fontanelles are closed by progressive ossification of the bones around them, but separate isolated centres of ossification may develop into sutural bones (<a href="#f0045">Fig. 34.9</a>). The sphenoidal and posterior fontanelles close within 2 or 3 months of birth and the mastoid fontanelles usually close near the end of the first year. Wide variability in both the size and the timing of closure of the anterior fontanelle has been reported, but most will have closed by the middle of the second year and almost all will have closed by 24 months (<a href="#bib39" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_39">Pindrik et al 2014</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0045"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000343/main.assets/f34-09-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0045"/><a id="fspara0045"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 34.9</span> The hydrocephalic skull of a 25-year-old male showing numerous sutural bones. <span class="bold">A</span>, Lateral view. <span class="bold">B</span>, Posterior view. <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, photograph by Mr J Carr.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0415">Early in the first years, the calvarial bones start interlocking at sutural junctions and further expansion is largely achieved by accretion and absorption on external and internal bone surfaces, respectively. At the same time the bones also thicken, although this is not a uniform process. At birth, the vault is unilaminar; the tabular structure with intervening diploë is generally apparent soon thereafter. Thickening of the vault and development of external muscular markings reflect the influences of musculoskeletal maturation. The mastoid processes do not usually develop until the second year and they are pneumatized in the sixth year (<a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Cunningham et al 2016</a>).

The prolonged period of continued expansion reflects a significant delaying mechanism that allows the continued and relatively late eruption of the permanent dentition. There is some evidence that growth may cease at about 15 years following eruption of the second molars, and this can often lead to insufficient space for growth of the third molars. A pubertal growth spurt has been ascribed to both sexes; it tends to occur some 2 years earlier in females and is likely to continue until the eighteenth year in the male (<a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml">Ch. 23</a>).

The ethmoid and the orbital and upper nasal cavities have almost completed growth by the seventh year. Orbital and upper nasal growth is achieved by sutural accretion, with deposition of bone preferentially occurring on the facial aspects of the sutural junctions. The maxilla is carried downwards and forwards by expansion of the orbits and nasal septum and by sutural growth, especially at the fontanelles and zygomaticomaxillary and pterygomaxillary sutures. In the first year, growth in width occurs at the symphysis menti and mid-palatal, internasal and frontal sutures; such growth diminishes or even ceases when the symphysis menti and frontal suture close during the first few years, even though the mid-palatal suture persists until mature years. Facial growth continues up to puberty and shows a period of expansion that is linked to the growth spurt and hormonal influences of secondary sexual alteration. After sutural growth, near the end of the second year, expansion of the facial skeleton occurs by surface accretion on the face, alveolar processes and palate, and resorption in the walls of the maxillary sinuses, the upper surface of the hard palate and the labial aspect of the alveolar process. Coordinated growth and divergence of the pterygoid processes reflect deposition and resorption of bone on appropriate surfaces.</div><div class="text" id="p0430">Obliteration of the calvarial sutures progresses with age, starting between 20 and 30 years internally and somewhat later on the exterior. Closure times vary greatly. Obliteration usually begins in the coronal or sagittal sutures and then extends into the lambdoid suture. The size of the mandible and maxillae diminish following the loss of teeth and consequent resorption of alveolar bone; this reduces the vertical depth of the face and increases the mandibular angles.</div></section><section><a id="s0120"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0130">Craniosynostosis</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0435">Sutural growth makes an important contribution to growth of the skull, especially during the first few years of life. Premature closure of sutures (craniosynostosis) leads to restriction of growth along the sutures, producing morphological changes that may result in skull deformity (<a href="#bib45" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_45">Sharma 2013</a>). Biomechanical forces and genetically determined local expression of growth factors have been implicated in the aetiology of premature fusion but the reasons are not fully understood. Premature fusion may occur in one or more of the cranial sutures; when the sutures around the cranial base are involved, severe limitation of facial bone growth will occur. Metabolic disorders such as rickets and familial hypophosphatasia can also result in synostosis. Raised intracranial pressure with or without hydrocephalus, visual deterioration and mental retardation may result. Scaphocephaly (sagittal craniosynostosis) is the most common and leads to lengthening of the vault in an anteroposterior direction; it can also occur in conjunction with other sutures, e.g. Crouzon’s syndrome. Coronal synostosis, either unilateral (plagiocephaly) or bilateral (brachycephaly/oxycephaly), is the next most frequently seen and results in reduced anteroposterior development with marked supraorbital recession. When it is unilateral, the face develops asymmetrically and is rotated away from the side with premature fusion. Metopic craniosynostosis (trigonocephaly) and pansynostosis (turricephaly), where both the coronal and sphenofrontal sutures are involved, are much less common.</div><div class="text" id="p0440">Craniofacial dysostosis syndromes, such as Crouzon’s, Apert’s, Saethre–Chotzen, Pfeiffer’s and Carpenter’s, show varying degrees of calvarial synostoses that are usually accompanied by a significant lack of growth in the midface. Early release of the calvarial synostoses does not result in normal facial growth, and a midfacial osteotomy at the Le Fort III level is usually required later in life. When significant orbital hypertelorism develops, a transcranial bipartitioning procedure is needed in order to bring the two orbits together.</div><div class="text" id="p0445">Altered patterns of skull growth resulting in altered profiles can also be achieved deliberately by affecting sutural growth using binding and other pressure, as has been practised in certain cultures of the world (<a href="#f0060">Fig. 34.10</a>) (<a href="#bib49" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_49">Tubbs et al 2006</a>).

Many are recognized patterns of malformation that are presumed to share the same aetiology. They do not arise as the result of a single isolated error in morphogenesis and are described as syndromes; specific texts should be consulted for further details.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0130"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0140">Identification From the Skull</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0455">There are many ways of identifying an individual; in physical and forensic anthropology, the most important are concerned with determining biological and personal identity (<a href="#bib56" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Wilkinson and Rynn 2012</a>). Biological identity pertains to those features that allow an individual to be classified in relation to features present in other individuals, e.g. sex, age, ancestry and stature, whereas personal identity establishes criteria that are characteristic and discriminatory for a particular individual, e.g. DNA, fingerprints, facial appearance and dental information. The skull is a useful source of information for establishing both biological and personal identity and is probably the most studied region of the skeleton.</div><section><a id="s0135"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0145">Sex estimation</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0460">The estimation of sex from a juvenile skull is notoriously unreliable. While sexual differences have been detected in measurements of the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="571" id="pagebreak_571"/><a id="pg571"/>mandible, orbits, tooth size and pattern of dental eruption, they do not reach a level of statistical discrimination that will allow accurate and reliable assessment. It is equally difficult to assign sex to the face of a child because the faces of prepubertal boys and girls are comparable; perceivable sexual dimorphism is not generally manifest until secondary sexual development is under way. Growth in the female face ceases in advance of that of the male and therefore female sex-related characteristics are more paedomorphic. The defining characteristics of sex in an adult skull are therefore male in orientation and reflect the effects of the increased mass of the muscles of mastication, which are attached to the mandible, and of the muscles associated with maintaining the erect head. It is reported that using the skull alone, sex can be predicted with over 80% accuracy in the adult, which is encouraging, given that research has shown that the correct sex can usually be predicted from the adult living face with 96% accuracy.</div><div class="text" id="p0465">Generally speaking, a male skull is more robust than the more gracile female skull, although there are obvious genetic, and therefore ancestral, variations that must be considered when attempting to assign sex from a skull. A female forehead is generally higher, more vertical and more rounded than a male forehead (where the frontal eminences are retained). A male mandible is generally more robust and larger than a female mandible; it displays a greater height in the region of the symphysis menti, the chin is squarer, the condyles are larger, the sites of muscle attachments are more pronounced and the gonial angle is generally less than 125°. A male skull generally also has thicker and more rounded orbital margins; pronounced supraorbital ridges; a well-defined glabella in the midline above the root of the nose; more pronounced temporal lines; and a supramastoid crest that extends posterior to the external acoustic meatus.</div><div class="text" id="p0470">Other sites of muscle attachment on the skull also reflect the biomechanical requirement to keep the more robust male head erect. They include the mastoid process for sternocleidomastoid, and the nuchal lines, especially the external occipital protuberance, for the attachment of the ligamentum nuchae: both are more robust in a male skull. The male cranial base is generally more robust and the bone is thicker than in a female skull, which means that this area of the skull survives burial particularly well and is therefore of value in sex identification from fragmentary remains.</div></section><section><a id="s0140"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0150">Age estimation</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0475">Age is a continuous variable; establishing chronological age from a skull is predicated on the concept that structures change with age at a relatively constant and predictable rate. The relationship between chronological age and skeletal maturity is closest in the juvenile years, and therefore greater accuracy is achieved in the prediction of age from the juvenile than from the adult skull.</div><div class="text" id="p0480">The neonatal skull has been described above. Examples of additional features that allow reliable age determination throughout the subadult years are: development of the nasal spine (by year 3), completion of the hypoglossal canal (by year 4), formation of the foramen of Huschke (by year 5), ossification of the dorsum sellae (by year 5), and fusion of the different parts of the occipital bone (by year 7) (<a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Cunningham et al 2016</a>). The fontanelles are usually all closed by the end of the second year; the posterolateral is the first to close in the first 2 months after birth, and the anterior fontanelle is the last to close around the middle to end of the second year. The mastoid process appears in the second year and the metopic suture between the two frontal bones is usually closed by the end of the first year. The spheno-occipital synchondrosis will fuse between 11 and 16 years in the female and 13 and 18 years in the male, while the vomer and the ethmoid will fuse between 20 and 30 years of age. The last part of the skull to show active age-related growth is the jugular synchondrosis (also known as the jugular growth plate), a small triangular area sited posterolateral to the jugular foramen in the occipitotemporal suture. Fusion here has been reported to commence in the second and third decades, depending on population group, and bilateral fusion may not be completed before the middle of the fourth decade; in a small proportion of individuals, the plate may remain unfused into the sixth decade. Closure of the cranial sutures is age-related but the correlation is not strong and displays strong genetic variation. Thus, while it can be said that suture closure may begin in the early part of the third decade, and it is likely that many of the sutures will be obliterated with advancing age, it is not a reliable means of establishing the age of an individual. See <a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Cunningham et al (2016)</a> for further information on age estimation from the juvenile skeleton.</div><div class="text" id="p0485">The most accurate means of estimating age from the skull (of both a living and a deceased individual) is by assessment of dental maturation. Tooth development can be studied throughout the entire juvenile age span (from the early embryo to the adolescent), and importantly, dental age and chronological age have been shown to exhibit a stronger correlation than skeletal and chronological age due to being influenced less by environmental factors compared to the skeleton. Further, the teeth tend to survive inhumation successfully and are remarkably resilient to extrinsic factors, ensuring their value in forensic investigations.</div><div class="text" id="p0490">The chronological pattern of dental maturation is well documented and is an extremely important tool for age evaluation. Tooth development can be separated into a number of well-defined stages: deciduous mineralization (crown and root), deciduous emergence and maturation, deciduous root resorption, shedding of deciduous teeth, mineralization (crown and root) of permanent dentition, emergence and maturation of deciduous dentition, and attrition of permanent crowns. These stages do not occur in a linear fashion; while some of the deciduous teeth are emerging, permanent teeth are already being formed. For example, mineralization of the deciduous central incisor commences around the fifteenth week post fertilization, and this is the first tooth to emerge within the first 5 months after birth. All deciduous teeth are in occlusion by around 3 years of age. The first deciduous teeth to be shed are generally the central and lateral incisors around 7 years of age, when the permanent incisors emerge. The last deciduous tooth to be shed is generally the second molar in the tenth year. The first permanent tooth to show mineralization is the first molar, which occurs around the time of birth (sometimes earlier and sometimes later); it is also the first permanent tooth to emerge at around 6 years of age, and it will reach occlusion by the end of the seventh year. The last permanent tooth to emerge is the third molar; the variability of this occurrence makes it of restricted value for age prediction.</div><div class="text" id="p0495">The time taken for a crown to form can be calculated from ground sections with considerable accuracy by counting the number of daily cross-striations from the neonatal line. These cross-striations are considered to result from the circadian rhythm inherent in the rate of enamel matrix secretion. For permanent teeth, the time taken for the crown to form can be calculated by counting the number of the enamel striae and multiplying by the individual’s periodicity. Patterns of mineralization, emergence and shedding may be supplemented by analyses of tooth length and apical width ratios, cementum apposition, secondary dentine formation, incremental enamel lines, attrition rates, root translucency and dentine transparency (<a href="#bib53" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_53">Whittaker and MacDonald 1989</a>). Chemical analysis of the stable isotopes of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen from teeth can provide important information concerning the nature of the diet of an individual and is used in paleodiet analysis and in studies of pathophysiology and nutrition in archaeological and living human populations (<a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">Reitsema 2013</a>).<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="572" id="pagebreak_572"/><a id="pg572"/></div></section><section><a id="s0980"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0155">Morphological assignment of ancestry</h3><div class="textfl" id="p8734">Physical anthropologists working in both archaeological and forensic arenas are frequently asked to assign a race/ancestry to a given skeleton, in order to facilitate an investigation into an unidentified body (Edgar and Hunley 2009). The traditional view of ancestry is as ‘one of the major subdivisions of mankind, regarded as having a common origin and exhibiting a relatively constant set of physical traits’ (Bamshad and Olson 2003). However, the usefulness of being able to classify ancestry when attempting to identify an individual from decomposed human remains varies depending on the degree of admixture in the local population compared to the level of admixture in the individual. For example, ancestry does not form part of the biological profile in some South American countries, because the majority of the local population is a mix of several ancestry groups; whereas if a body found in the Highlands of Scotland was assessed as being anything other than of Caucasoid ancestry, it might narrow the field of search considerably.</div><div class="text" id="p5050">In forensic/biological anthropology there are at least four broad, overlapping ancestry groups. A relatively high proportion of individuals exhibit a degree of admixture such that variation within a group is often as great as the variation between groups. With the occasional exception (e.g. pelvis (Iscan and Cotton 1985) and femur (Gill 2001)), ancestry is almost exclusively evident in the skull.</div></section><section><a id="s0150"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0160">Forensic facial approximation, reconstruction and depiction</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0530">There are four primary methods of legally identifying a body: DNA, fingerprint, dental and radiological matching. These are all matching processes, meaning that both postmortem and antemortem equivalent data are required for comparison to one another. If the body is past a certain point of decomposition, postmortem data might be unobtainable or corrupted: even DNA is damaged in both fire and water. Alternatively or additionally, the antemortem data might not exist if the individual in life was not on any databases, which is more common than one might suppose: a healthy, law-abiding citizen with perfect teeth might not be on any of these databases. When an investigation into an unidentified body runs into this problem, using forensic facial reconstruction to present an image of the face via the media might be the only way to generate leads for the investigation. Eliciting a recognition reaction from a friend or a family member of a missing person might in turn generate a DNA or fingerprint sample, a set of dental records for comparison, or even a missing person photograph upon which Craniofacial Superimposition can be performed, aligning the 3D skull with the photograph for a direct anatomical comparison, without all the estimations and averages involved in the initial facial reconstruction.</div><div class="text" id="p0535">Commonly applied techniques to estimate a face from a skull (<a href="#f0065"><span class="bold">Fig. 34.11</span></a>) combine three areas: the soft tissue depth and pattern across the face; facial feature estimation (eyes, nose, lips and ears all based on separate research); anatomical interpretation of the musculature, including attachment sites and muscle shape. The anatomical methodology is underpinned by scientific standards, anthropometry and morphological patterning in order to predict distinctive facial characteristics. The process can be automated or practitioner-led; although a few practitioners still use traditional clay modelling, most contemporary facial reconstructions are produced using non-invasive clinical/surface imaging, 3D digital technology and photo-editing software. Method summaries are described in a number of anthropology texts (Clement and Ransom 1998, Stephan 2009, Wilkinson 2010, Wilkinson and Rynn 2012).</div><div id="p0395"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0065"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000343/main.assets/on34-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0055"/><a id="fspara0055"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 34.11</span> Facial superimposition: a live capture image of the skull has been manipulated into the identical position and size of the face in the photograph. <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Professor Caroline Wilkinson and Professor Sue Black, Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification, University of Dundee.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></section></section><footer><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="572.e2" id="pagebreak_572.e2"/><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebib0010"/><h2 class="reftitle" id="s0910">References</h2><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebibsec0010"/><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib9"><!--<a hreef="#bib_9">9</a>. --><a id="ref0035"/><a href="#bib_9">Ambekar</a> S, Sonig A, Nanda A. <cite>Dorello’s canal and Gruber’s ligament: historical perspective</cite>. <cite><i>J Neurol Surg B Skull Base</i></cite>. 2012;73:430–433.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib10"><!--<a hreef="#bib_10">10</a>. --><a id="ref0040"/><a href="#bib_9">Bamshad</a> M, Olson S. <cite>Does race exist?</cite> <cite><i>Sci Am</i></cite>. 2003;289:78–85.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib12"><!--<a hreef="#bib_12">12</a>. --><a id="nspara1105"/><a href="#bib_9">This</a> article challenges our perspective on what race is and what that actually means for our modern, diverse world.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib11"><!--<a hreef="#bib_11">11</a>. --><a id="ref0045"/><a href="#bib_11">Barges-Coll</a> J, Fernandez-Miranda J.C, Prevedello D.M, et al. <cite>Avoiding injury to the abducens nerve during expanded endonasal endoscopic surgery: anatomic and clinical case studies</cite>. <cite><i>Neurosurgery</i></cite>. 2010;67:144–154.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib13"><!--<a hreef="#bib_13">13</a>. --><a id="ref0050"/><a href="#bib_13">Belden</a> C.J. <cite>The skull base and calvaria.
