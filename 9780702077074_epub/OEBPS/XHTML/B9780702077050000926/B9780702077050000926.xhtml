For the glenohumeral joint (GHJ) stability is therefore the product of a functionally (not necessarily anatomically) intact rotator cuff, competent capsular and labral structures, a sufficient surface arc (or surface area) of contact between humeral head and glenoid, and an intact neuromuscular system comprising central and peripheral connections, with functioning mechanoreceptors clustered in the capsule and labrum, and in the tendons of the rotator cuff (RC) and long head of biceps (LHBT).</div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">The essence of stability and the stability equation</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0020">Motion about the centroid of rotation and ʻcontainmentʼ of the humeral head on the size-mismatched glenoid is the result of concavity compression, generated by the centralizing joint reaction force (CJRF) of the rotator cuff (including LHBT), and the generation of negative intra-articular pressure, facilitated by the conformity of the glenoid/labral surface. Rotator cuff competence is a function of centrally driven activation via feed-forward systems, and the strength and inertia of the cuff muscles. Shoulder joint position sense and motion are the products of right parietal cortical programming (the parietal reach region), and visual, vestibular and cervical afferent inputs: it appears that visual cues are more important than hand position in determining the control of shoulder motion. Maintenance of this activity is achieved through feedback mechanisms derived through mechanoreceptors in the capsular and labral structures, rotator cuff tendons and muscles, and the surfaces of the shoulder gliding planes (the acromio-coraco-deltoid-scapulothoracic space, and the glenohumeral joint space), and affected by the inertia of the rotator cuff tendino-fibrous ʻskeletonʼ and muscles, and fascial and cutaneous afferents. The relationship between the dominant factors in creating stability in the GHJ can be illustrated by a simple diagram (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 6.3.1</span></a>), and described by an equation:</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000926/main.assets/f92-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 6.3.1</span> Schematic of factors involved in generating stability in the glenohumeral joint.

The number of muscle spindles (MS, predominantly <span class="italic">stretch</span> receptors) in rotator cuff muscles has been studied in marsupials and is approximately 1.5 times the number of Golgi tendon organs (GTO; predominantly <span class="italic">contraction</span> receptors) (<a href="#bib6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_6">Maass et al 2001a</a>, <a href="#bib7" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_7">2001b</a>). GTOs are situated predominantly in the musculotendinous junctions and at the regions of confluence between the tendon and capsule of the joint. Both muscle spindles and GTOs have large myelinated, fast conducting afferents. The GHJ will remain stable in the partial absence of medial capsulolabral structures (for instance after surgical release for frozen shoulder syndrome, or complete capsulotomy for total shoulder replacement), provided that the rotator cuff function is normal. Thus the dominant proprioceptive input for glenohumeral stability would appear to be from the muscles and the tendinous endoskeleton of the rotator cuff. The LHBT has a special role in linking rotator cuff activity, humeral head position and overall upper limb position, particularly in activities requiring optimal close-packing of the shoulder and elbow. Anomalies of the intra-articular tendon and isolated rupture of the tendon do not appear to contribute to humeral head instability, provided the closely associated components of the rotator cuff remain intact. By contrast, a rotator cuff rupture in an elderly patient presents as superior GHJ instability.</div><div class="text" id="p0040">Second, the SAC can vary. Thus, segmental dysplasia of the glenoid, congenital glenoid version anomalies and humeral head defects (Broca or Hill–Sachs, and McLaughlin lesions) all contribute to a decrement in the SAC, which predisposes to failure of the CJRF vector to pass through the glenoid during all arcs of motion.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">Third, the structure of the CLMNS can vary considerably. The labrum can be absent, hypoplastic, or dysplastic, and ligament anomalies are well recognized (and common) in subjects with no instability. The incidence of ligamentous anomalies in patients with atraumatic structural instability is the same as that in the general population: lax individuals do not appear to have a greater prevalence of anomalies of ligament morphology, although the molecular structure is clearly altered. The labrum contains numerous free nerve endings, with a frequency about ten times greater than any other corpuscular receptor type (<a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_3">Halata et al 1985</a>), which are readily distorted by motion.</div><div class="text" id="p0050">The number of corpuscular mechanoreceptors in the capsule of a marsupial is equivalent to that of muscle spindles, with about 87% being small lamellated corpuscles (rapid-response stretch signalling in a local region) having relatively smaller myelinated afferents than either MSs or GTOs. Pacinian corpuscles (rapid-response stretch signalling over a wider field) are found in the outer fibrous laminae of the capsule, predominantly in the axillary region, while Ruffini corpuscles, which are uncommon, are found in the dense fibrous layer of the capsule in the axilla, and the dermis of the skin. When articular afferents are stimulated in the cat shoulder there is a very short latency (3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>ms) to contraction in biceps and deltoid, suggesting a monosynaptic reflex at spinal cord level (<a href="#bib4" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_4">Knatt et al 1995</a>). There therefore appears to exist a gradient of receptor speed, locality and density from within to without the joint. As is apparent from the preceding text, data is largely derived from non-human sources, but there is increasing clarity about the role of neural pathways in generating and maintaining shoulder joint stability (<a href="#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_8">Myers and Lephart 2002</a>). It is not known whether variations occur in the densities or function of mechanoreceptors in the capsule and labrum in patients with atraumatic structural and muscle-patterning.</div><div class="text" id="p0055">Fourth, neural control systems are readily deranged, by central or peripheral neurological conditions: aberrant muscle activation or suppression contributes to GHJ instability (<a href="#bib2" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_2">Gibson et al 2004</a>), and diseases of the cerebellum and basal ganglia may present with shoulder instability, particularly of the scapulothoracic joint.</div><div class="text" id="p0060">It is self-evident that we are not aware of our shoulder if it has not been injured or affected by a disease in some way, nor do we regard it during gestural and stereotactic activities. In other words, the presentation of our shoulder is unconscious: all activity is predicted, planned and executed without cognition. This lack of conscious awareness of the shoulder (or any other joint) seems likely to be a function of the entirety of the afferent data about the shoulder. Different combinations of afferent inputs must be produced during varying positions and actions involving the joint. However, providing the total afferent input remains within a range of normality for that joint at that particular time (as predicted by the purpose for which the joint action has been generated), there is no conscious awareness of the joint. If injured, there is awareness (i.e. a conscious, therefore cortical, event occurs, one usually signifying <span class="italic">potential</span> danger) and, if the injury is sufficient, what is clinically defined as ‘apprehension’ (i.e. a conscious, therefore cortical, event appreciated as a fear of <span class="italic">actual</span> danger) often accompanied by a reflex <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="9.8600001E7" id="pagebreak_9.8600001E7"/><a id="pg986.e6"/>activation of muscles of the shoulder girdle region. If the injury is more deleterious still, and tissue disruption of a critical ‘amount’ occurs, then pain will occur (in biological evolutionary terms, the incentive to remove oneself from the source of the injury). The central pathways of awareness, apprehension and pain are similar. The total afferent input from the shoulder joint has been changed in some way, and if there has been a disruption of tissues then that region of disruption will likely be de-afferented. A change in overall afferent input, either an absolute loss or an alteration in the ratio of inputs from the various sources, results in both cortical and spinal level reflex (protective) activity. Since the central nervous system works on the principle of inhibition, the ‘permission’ of spinal activity activating a shoulder girdle response (‘apprehension’) is produced by an inhibition of the normal inhibitory pathways of motor activation patterns. The individual becomes aware (now at cortical level) of actions, motions or positions of the arm in space which will both generate pain (through distortion of the injured afferent neural tissue) and unpleasant sensations perceived as potential or incipient displacement of the articular surfaces. Restoration of the afferent input, by the healing of the disrupted tissues (whether by natural means or by surgery) results in less pain and less apprehension. That some patients often remark that their shoulder ‘feels’ better immediately after restorative surgery (if undertaken soon after the injury) suggests that the afferent pathways from spinal level to cortical level remain intact and non-adapted. That other patients, also undergoing restorative surgery, particularly after recurrent episodes of dislocation or failed healing, take a long time to recover to the point of no apprehension suggests not only that re-afferentation is relatively less well organized and quantitatively diminished, but also that central re-adaptation has to occur. That rehabilitation programmes designed to restore stability take roughly the same period as programmes for integrating tendon transfers suggests similar central neural mechanisms are at work. Muscle-patterning instability, the so-called Stanmore type III instability (see below), is a large spectrum of disorders of shoulder stability, characterized by a lack of structural abnormalities, likely to be a failure (by inhibition) of the normal inhibitory pathways of muscle control.</div><div class="text" id="p0065">The increased risk of a traumatic GHJ dislocation in the first-degree relatives of patients with traumatic (i.e. structural) GHJ instability suggests a predisposition to the condition, even where the structure of the joint was previously apparently normal. Whether this is located in the afferent, central, or efferent components of the neural control mechanisms is uncertain, but the part of the ‘system’ that could most readily be perturbed is the afferent, in terms of the number, density and distribution of mechanoreceptors.</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0020">Instability: a clinical definition</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0070">Instability is usefully defined as the condition of symptomatic abnormal motion of the joint. This universal definition combines the mechanistic view and the clinical perspective, and distinguishes the pathological state from the constitutional state of laxity, in which anatomical anomalies may exist, but do not necessarily cause impairment of function. Since it is a symptom, the term implies recognition (a cerebral cortical event) of the abnormal motion (a difference in position, motion direction or motion velocity has been identified by the patient): ‘instability’ cannot be determined by examining the shoulder under anaesthetic (EUA). Laxity (looseness) of the GHJ can be determined by EUA either by comparison of the perceived abnormal with the perceived normal side or by reference to what is considered a normal range of laxity for the population of which the patient is representative.</div><div class="text" id="p0075">The relationship between the dominant factors in creating instability in the GHJ can be described by a second equation, derived from the first:</div><div><div id="fd2"><div class="hiddenClass"><!--<mml:math alttext="MathML" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Instability</mml:mtext><mml:mspace/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mspace/><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mtext>a</mml:mtext></mml:msup><mml:mspace/><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mspace/><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mtext>b</mml:mtext></mml:msup><mml:mspace/><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mspace/><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mtext>c</mml:mtext></mml:msup><mml:mspace/><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mspace/><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mtext>d</mml:mtext></mml:msup><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mspace/><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>--></div><div class="showClass"><div class="fig"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000926/main.stripin/si2.png" alt="image"/></div></div></div></div><div class="textfl">where the elements <span class="italic">RC</span>, <span class="italic">SAC</span>, <span class="italic">CLMNS</span> and <span class="italic">NS</span> are as before (see above) and a–d are factors describing the weight of each element in the overall mechanism of instability for that individual at a specific point in time. <span class="italic">P</span> are patient-specific factors (occupational and sports, lifestyle, motivation in rehabilitation, etc.), and <span class="italic">t</span> represents the probability that pathology will evolve over time.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">The pathologies causing instability comprise structural (<span class="italic">RC</span>, <span class="italic">SAC</span>) and non-structural (<span class="italic">NS</span>) elements.

Laxity varies with age. Adolescents have a greater overall range of motion than adults, and stiffness (reduced compliance of rotator cuff and capsular tissues) increases with age. Shoulder laxity can exist as part of the generalized benign hypermobility syndromes, or as part of an upper limb dominant form of hypermobility, or in isolation. In the latter form, if one shoulder alone is affected then congenital bony architectural anomalies should be considered, whereas if bilateral isolated shoulder hypermobility is present then soft tissue anomalies are more prevalent.</div><section><a id="s0035"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0030">Appropriate laxity</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0090">Normal soft tissue laxity is influenced by many factors such as oestrogen levels, the state of hydration and training. Laxity is very useful in certain circumstances (for instance during childbirth), so selective biological advantage might be conferred on those who develop appropriate laxity. Similarly, degenerative arthritis is uncommon in those who have loose shoulders, unless there are associated morphological anomalies of the glenoid or proximal humerus or inappropriate operations have been performed.</div></section><section><a id="s0040"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0035">Inappropriate laxity, energy expenditure and the rotator cuff</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0095">Much greater energy expenditure is required to maintain shoulder stability in hyperlax shoulders, which means that persistent laxity does not confer a selective biological advantage, except in those whose daily activities, including sport, require laxity for best performance (e.g. dancers and swimmers). These individuals must train consistently to protect their shoulder connective tissues from overload: the capacity of the rotator cuff to generate a centralizing joint reaction force (to keep the humeral articular surface on the glenoid) is much less at the extreme ranges of motion. The musculature of the rotator cuff is specifically organized from deep to superficial so that the shortest muscle fibres (the deepest fibres) take origin at the most lateral extent of their scapular attachment, and insert into the capsule of the shoulder. These fibres contribute most to the centralizing or stabilizing function. The most superficial muscle fibres take origin more medially on the scapula and insert into the humerus <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="9.86000001E8" id="pagebreak_9.86000001E8"/><a id="pg986.e7"/>lateral to the articular surface (on the tuberosities) through their tendons and by direct muscle insertions. These fibres contribute more to the initiation and control of motion of the shoulder. Each muscle fibre has a length at which it functions optimally and therefore each muscle, depending on the position of the shoulder, has a specific range of motion over which its constituent fibres contribute best to both stability and the control of motion. It follows that when the muscle fibres are at their shortest, at the extremes of range of motion, their effectiveness as both stabilizers and controllers of motion is suboptimal. At these positions the activity of the rotator cuff becomes very asymmetrical: the stability of the joint is less and the rapidity of response to motion diminished. Greater muscle bulk increases the inertia of the joint (its ‘passive’ resistance to displacement), so that training to increase muscle bulk will improve stability, but will conversely require greater energy expenditure. When training ceases, muscle tone diminishes and the joints are less protected. If, in addition, microtraumatic structural surface damage has occurred as a result of previous activity then the joint is at greater risk of degenerative change. The quality of proprioception is reduced in shoulders with hyperlaxity, instability and previous capsular trauma. Improvement in joint position and motion sense has been shown in trained shoulders, and after anterior capsular reconstruction in those with traumatic structural instability. It is not clear whether this is also the case for patients with atraumatic structural instability.</div></section><section><a id="s0045"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0040">Group I (Traumatic structural instability)</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0100">The traumatic structural group includes the TUBS (Traumatic, Unilateral, Bankart lesion present [in the anterior instability type], Surgery usually indicated) group but also includes the posterior traumatic instability characterized by the McLaughlin or reversed Hill–Sachs lesion and posterior labral damage or locked posterior dislocation. Instability can thus be acute, recurrent or persistent (acute or chronic). Luxatio erecta is a specific version of anterior instability, usually of the more elderly, and may be associated with infraclavicular plexopathy, rotator cuff rupture and extensive bruising indicative of rupture of the humeral circumflex vessels. Surgical treatment is indicated for most patients in whom capsulolabral or rotator cuff disruption is evident: the choice and timing of open versus arthroscopic surgical techniques remains controversial.</div></section><section><a id="s0050"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0045">Group II (Atraumatic structural instability)</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0105">In this group the incidence of ligamentous anomalies is the same as in the population of traumatic instabilities. The group contains the population defined as AMBRI (Atraumatic, often Multidirectional, often Bilateral, treated by Rehabilitation/physiotherapy). In the original definition of AMBRI, surgical treatment by inferior capsular shift is indicated if rehabilitation fails. However, this concept is flawed because some patients will possess some neuromuscular control aberration: surgery may fail because of the muscle-patterning behaviour (so-called type III instability) and patients may have a substantially greater probability of developing instability or post-capsulorrhaphy arthropathy if surgery is undertaken. The decision to operate should not be made on the basis of failed physiotherapy.</div><div class="text" id="p0110">This group also contains a subgroup of individuals with benign hypermobility syndrome (of which Ehlers–Danlos syndrome is a variant), characterized by a Beighton score of greater than 5 out of a total possible 9 points. Hypermobility may be limited to the upper limbs. These patients may present with pain rather than overtly abnormal displacements and anterior atraumatic instability is less common than posterior atraumatic positional types. Posterior structural anomalies (including posterior glenoid dysplasia, excessive glenoid retroversion, glenoid hypoplasia, and medialized posterior capsular attachment) create an environment in which obligatory positional posterior displacement may occur during elevation of the arm in the sagittal plane. If abnormal, clinically obvious, muscle activation appears <span class="italic">at the onset</span> of this motion, then the diagnosis is modified to acknowledge the muscle-patterning: the case is group II/III (peripheral subtype). If the muscular activation occurs <span class="italic">during</span> the motion, and appears to be provoked by the position of the arm at the shoulder, then the diagnosis is still II/III but with the suffix (protective subtype). If there is no clinically or electrophysiologically proven aberrant muscle activation, then the condition is labelled II (positional subtype).</div><div class="text" id="p0115">Scapular dyskinesis is common, and reflects the attempt by the scapular postural muscles to maintain scapulohumeral homeostasis. Serratus anterior can be suppressed in some cases: the aberrant muscle activity now affects the scapula primarily: this represents a scapulothoracic (STh) type III condition. Treatment consists of rehabilitation, avoidance of activities promoting the instability, pain management, and surgical intervention in selected cases. The variants of medially or laterally based inferior capsular shift with augmentation of dysplastic labral tissue are complemented in some cases of glenoid insufficiency by glenoid augmentation using autologous bone blocks (anteriorly and/or posteriorly), or glenoplasty (the Scott posterior glenoplasty, or posteroinferior segmental glenoplasty).</div></section><section><a id="s0055"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0050">Group III (Muscle-patterning instability)</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0120">Muscle-patterning instability (MPI) consists of aberrant activation of large muscles identified by dynamic electromyography (latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major and anterior deltoid have been characterized thus far) and simultaneous suppression of the rotator cuff (infraspinatus has been characterized thus far: whether suppression of infraspinatus reflects suppression of the whole rotator cuff or specific suppression of infraspinatus is not yet clear). MPI can be clinically obvious, in polar group III, but may be occult, requiring dynamic electromyography (DEMG) for confirmation of the suspicion of the existence of MPI in the presentation (as in types II/III and III/II instabilities).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0060"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0055">Demographic characteristics</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0125">Patients with abnormal muscular activation leading to ‘pure’ MPI appear to present in a trimodal distribution with peaks at 6, 14 and 20 years. The mean age at onset of symptoms is 14 years and the mean duration of symptoms before presentation is 8 years. In the under-10-year age group there are more girls (71% vs 47%), greater laxity (estimated with the Beighton score, 63% vs 29%), greater bilaterality (54% vs 42%) and fewer presenting with pain (17% vs 50%). As age increased, laxity decreased and pain increased. Bilaterality does not appear to be associated with gender, laxity or pain. Laxity is associated with gender but not pain or bilaterality. These observations suggest different aetiologies for the MPI in the three cohorts.</div><div class="text" id="p0130"><a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_1">Bayley (2005)</a> used DEMG in latissimus dorsi (LD), pectoralis major (PM), anterior deltoid (AD) and infraspinatus (IS) to evaluate the patterns of muscular activation in patients who clearly demonstrated, visibly or by palpation, apparently abnormal muscular activation immediately before and during dislocation of the glenohumeral joint in the outpatient clinic. These muscles were chosen because they were reliably accessible. Early pilot studies were expanded into a cohort study of over 1000 cases of GHI seen at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, a tertiary referral centre, over a 22-year period (1981–2003), from which DEMG data were extracted. Muscle-patterning instability was diagnosed, clinically and/or electrophysiologically, in 494 shoulders of 386 patients (45% of the entire cohort of 1097 shoulders). In 44% the MP instability (MPI) affected both shoulders. The dominant arm was affected more often in right-handed patients, the non-dominant more often in left-handed patients. The central neurological basis for these differences <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="986.e8" id="pagebreak_986.e8"/><a id="pg986.e8"/>remains obscure. There were 323 shoulders with ‘pure’ MPI; 161 shoulders presented a mixed picture of MPI in addition to either traumatic or atraumatic structural causes for the instability.</div><div class="text" id="p0135">The value of recognizing this form of instability is considerable given the success of specialist physiotherapy using biofeedback techniques rather than conventional therapy for retraining abnormal muscle activity: 76% of patients had either no change or a deterioration in their condition with conventional therapy (including conventional strengthening exercises) compared with 61% of patients overall achieving improvement in their condition with specialist therapy. The incidence of iatropathic arthropathy increases with inappropriate surgery in those with type III instability, but has not been reported in patients with type III instability who did not undergo surgery.</div></section><section><a id="s0065"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0060">Dynamic electromyography</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0140">Given the limitation that only four muscles have been studied in depth, the evidence strongly suggests that these, and perhaps other, muscles are implicated in many cases of instability. Inappropriate activity in PM, LD and AD, with suppression of IS, appear either singly or as couples in the generation of instability in the shoulder with and without capsular collagen insufficiency. Whether suppression of IS reflects specific inappropriate inactivity in IS alone or reflects abnormal activation of the rotator cuff as a whole remains unknown. DEMG provides additional information about abnormal muscle activation or suppression in subtle muscle-patterning instability in which clinical examination has a low specificity and sensitivity. DEMG was found to be most useful in patients presenting with pain, glenohumeral capsular insufficiency and occult muscle-patterning, categorized as the interpolar group II/III. Given that a chance of a successful outcome for rehabilitation of patients with MPI (symptoms abolished or controlled) was diminished five-fold for anterior and 10-fold for posterior instability after inappropriate surgery in patients with MPI, it is clear that the identification of this specific cohort is important. These patients contribute to the failures of the AMBRI group after rehabilitation (if MPI has not been recognized). It is noteworthy that the pathology is not defined by direction but rather that the direction of instability is determined by the pathology.</div><div class="text" id="p0145">Rehabilitation is the first mode of treatment used for MPI: there is usually a change in aberrant muscle activity within 6 months. Therapy has to continue for at least two years, possibly for cortical re-imprinting to be re-established. There is a 25% recurrence rate within two years, needing ‘top-up’ therapy, including in-patient treatment in which a multidisciplinary approach is favoured. The value of specific suppression of specific muscles by injection of botulinum toxin is unclear.</div></section><section><a id="s0070"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0065">Multidirectional instability (MDI)</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0150">MDI is not a diagnosis but a symptom. Multidirectional <span class="italic">laxity</span> is assessed by examination under anaesthesia (EUA). It may be difficult to determine if a lax shoulder is centralized during EUA. An individual shoulder may have the same pathology (i.e. group I, II or III pathology) causing instability in each of more than one direction, or more than one pathology (e.g. group I in one direction, and group II/III in the other direction), thus distinguishing ʻgroup I’ MDI from ʻcomplexʼ MDI. The underlying diagnoses of the different directions of instability are distinguishable by the history, clinical observations, arthroscopy and/or magnetic resonance imaging with arthrography, supplemented by dynamic electro-myography (DEMG) where necessary. Each pathology is treated separately, with rehabilitation of MPI elements taking priority.</div></section><section><a id="s0075"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0070">Summary</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0155">Functional disturbance within the neurological pathways that control joint stability appears to be a fundamental component of the pathologies that lead to instability. Current understanding of the afferent ‘field’ for stability in the shoulder is poor. Inferences from non-human experimental animal studies have been illuminating but it is unclear how accurately they reflect the human condition. The ascending pathways and spinal level reflexes needed to maintain shoulder stability in humans are even less well characterized. The subcortical and cortical mechanisms of control of shoulder (and other joint) motion are better understood as a result of experimental animal studies, but the inter-related mechanisms of joint position and motion awareness (proprioception), apprehension and pain await clarification.</div><div class="text" id="p0160">Mechanical insufficiency in the anatomical structures that comprise the shoulder may lead to dysfunction that presents as the syndrome of instability. Given the variability of these anatomical structures, it seems reasonable to suggest that the overall afferent ‘field’ of the shoulder (from cutaneous to capsular and osseous mechanoceptors) exerts a more significant influence on joint stability or its perturbation. The neurological deficit consequent on structural damage or degeneration, or inherent in poorly developed tissues, may be more important, and the restoration of a neurologically healed shoulder may be a more logical goal than one which is structurally intact but neurologically incompetent.</div></section></section></section><footer><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebib0010"/><h2 class="reftitle" id="s0080">References</h2><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebibsec0010"/><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib1"><!--<a hreef="#bib_1">1</a>. --><a id="ref0010"/><a href="#bib_1">Bayley</a> J.I.L, Lewis A, Kitamura T. <cite>The classification of shoulder instability.
