According to this model, abdominal digestive organs are organized along peritoneal lines and the position of each is described using the terms ‘intra’-, ‘extra’-, or ‘retro’-peritoneal (<a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_14">Snell 1992</a>). However, some organs have both intra- and retro-peritoneal regions, a feature that is not explained by conventional embryological models of abdominal development. For example, the duodenum in the adult is ‘retro’-peritoneal in position while the rest of the small intestine is ‘intra’-peritoneal. The peritoneal landscape appears complex and regionalized into sacs, fossae and pouches that are described using an array of terms including fold, ligament, membrane and reflection. This heterogeneous terminology makes understanding abdominal anatomy challenging.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">Abdominal organs are usually described as being individually connected to the rest of the body, typically mediated by a network of vascular and peritoneal links. The small intestine and the transverse and sigmoid colons are exceptions to this pattern and are conventionally described as linked to the rest of the body via their respective ‘mesenteries’ (<a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Snell 1992</a>). The peritoneal and fascial models that have been generated by the concept of multiple mesenteries are dauntingly complex. Fasciae within the abdomen are described as individual entities, a practice that arose in part because they were described separately, e.g. Toldt’s, Denonvilliers’ and Waldeyer’s fasciae (<a href="#bib6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_6">Congdon et al 1942</a>, <a href="#bib100" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_100">Coffey and Kiran 2017</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0020">Mesenteric anatomy distal to the duodenojejunal flexure was clarified by the demonstration that the mesentery is continuous and connects the small and large intestines to the rest of the body (<a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_3">Coffey et al 2017</a>). This perspective also explains peritoneal and fascial anatomy distal to the duodenojejunal flexure (<a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Coffey et al 2017</a>).

According to the mesenteric-based model of abdominal anatomy and compartmentalization, the abdomen is divided into two principal domains, mesenteric and non-mesenteric. The mesenteric domain contains all abdominal digestive organs positioned on the mesentery. The non-mesenteric domain comprises all non-digestive organs (i.e. the genitourinary organs) positioned on the musculoskeletal mainframe of the abdomen. The domains are connected, attached and linked anatomically. They are <span class="italic">connected</span> at the arterial inflow and venous drainage of the mesentery. The arterial inflow occurs at the coeliac trunk, and superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. Venous drainage occurs at the junction between the hepatic veins and the inferior vena cava. Both domains are <span class="italic">attached</span>, which means the posterior surface of the mesenteric domain is apposed to the anterior surface of the non-mesenteric domain: there is a fascia between apposed surfaces (<a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Coffey et al 2017</a>). The junction between fascia and the overlying mesentery is a conceptual zone that surgeons access when they detach the mesentery from its attachment to the posterior abdominal wall. At the periphery of the mesenteric domain, the two domains are <span class="italic">linked</span> by the peritoneal reflection, a serous mesothelial membrane that bridges the parietal peritoneum lining the non-mesenteric domain and the visceral peritoneum of the mesenteric domain.</div><div class="text" id="p0035">The mesenteric-based model of abdominal compartmentalization explains several aspects of abdominal anatomy. Whilst the peritoneal landscape is generally regarded as extremely complex, it can be understood readily if approached with reference to the mesentery. From this perspective, the lining of organs of the mesenteric domain corresponds to ‘visceral’ peritoneum. The lining of the non-mesenteric domain corresponds to ‘parietal’ peritoneum. At the periphery of the mesenteric domain, parietal peritoneum detaches from the non-mesenteric domain and is reflected onto the mesenteric domain, where it continues as the lining of the latter (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 8.1.2</span></a>). The regions, sacs, pouches and cavities of the peritoneal landscape are regions of this model. Folds, ligaments and membranes are terms applied to different regions of peritoneal reflection.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000094X/main.assets/f94-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 8.1.2</span> The peritoneum.

For example, the head of the pancreas is located in the mid-region of the mesentery whilst its neck and body are located in the upper region (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 8.1.3</span></a>). The location of each of the arteries supplying individual organs can also be explained in mesenteric terms. The same principle applies to the extrahepatic portal venous system. For example, the inferior mesenteric vein travels in the left mesocolon to reach the central zone of the mesentery, where it merges with the splenic and/or superior mesenteric vein to generate the hepatic portal vein (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 8.1.4</span></a>). The latter utilizes the mesoduodenum posterior to the pancreas to reach the liver. The shape of the periphery of the mesentery also explains the double spiral trajectory of the abdominal digestive tract (<a href="#f0030"><span class="bold">Fig. 8.1.5</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0020"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000094X/main.assets/f94-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0020"/><a id="fspara0020"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 8.1.3</span> The relationship of the pancreas to the mesentery.

Where surfaces of the mesenteric and non-mesenteric domains are apposed, there is a fascia between them: the fasciae originally described by separate investigators are now perceived as different regions of the same tissue layer.</div><div class="text" id="p0050">Mesenteric-based compartmentalization explains how abdominal digestive organs are linked to systems of the body. They are directly connected to the mesentery and, in turn, the mesentery collectively connects all of them to each system (and hence to the body). This perspective represents a radical departure from conventional descriptions, which hold that all abdominal digestive organs are centrally connected via a network of peritoneal derivatives.</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0020">Embryological development of mesenteric and non-mesenteric compartments</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0055">The earliest mesenteric correlate is a double fold of mesothelium directly connected to the developing abdominal wall along the posterior midline.

Early in development the posterior connection regresses until it is reduced to vascular and surface mesothelial (i.e. peritoneal) continuity. All abdominal digestive organs develop within, and remain connected to, the mesentery. Later in development, regions of the mesentery flatten back against the posterior abdominal wall (i.e. they become attached) as they are packaged into a final <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1.330001E6" id="pagebreak_1.330001E6"/><a id="pg1330.e3"/>conformation.

In the adult setting, all abdominal digestive organs remain connected to it, and it collectively connects them all to the posterior abdominal wall.

There are suggestions in classical texts that it was apparent to some Italian anatomists during the Renaissance. Several drawings from this era depict a complex of structures that includes all abdominal digestive organs centred on the mesentery (<a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_1">Byrnes et al 2019a</a>). A vogue developed in the 19th century for describing multiple separate mesenteries (e.g. <a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_10">Gray 1858</a>), and this approach was subsequently reflected in all mainstream reference texts. The concept of multiple separate mesenteries generated a complex peritoneal and fascial landscape that hampered investigation of the mesentery, which was largely ignored until recently. Interest in the mesentery was rekindled when surgeons recognized that its resection was required for good outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for cancer of abdominal digestive organs. Re-appraisal of mesenteric anatomy and embryological development led to the recognition of mesenteric continuity and connection with all abdominal digestive organs. These anatomical properties, which were recognized after adaptation of surgical techniques to dissection of the cadaveric human abdomen, could then be combined to generate the mesenteric model of abdominal compartmentalization. They were corroborated by observations related to embryological development of the mesentery. Given this, the mesenteric model is the first to comprehensively reconcile embryological, anatomical and surgical approaches to the abdomen, fields that had diverged considerably during the past century.</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0030">Implications</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0065">The model has wide scientific and clinical implications. Because it clarifies the organization of the abdomen and its contents, it enables the abdomen to be characterized systematically (i.e. scientifically).

The model also enables the radiologist to build a composite picture of abdominal anatomy in paediatric and adult populations, which will facilitate a non-invasive interpretation of the nature and stage of abdominal diseases (<a href="#bib7" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Dalla Pria et al 2019</a>).

All signals that pass between the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system must traverse the mesentery. Accordingly, the gut–brain axis becomes the gut–mesentery–brain axis (<a href="#bib5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Coffey and O’Leary 2016</a>). The junction between the mesentery and abdominal digestive organ is highly relevant to the normal functioning of the body.
