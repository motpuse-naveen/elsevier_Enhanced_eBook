Embryonic genome activation occurs in the 4–8 cells stage (<a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_28">Niakan et al 2012</a>) when embryonic cells express polarity genes, initiating cell–cell interaction (<a href="#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Mihajlović and Bruce 2017</a>); by 6 days post fertilization the hatched blastocyst is able to interact with maternal tissue. A simplistic but useful concept likens these early developmental processes to a series of binary choices (see <a href="../B9780702077050000082/B9780702077050000082.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 8.1</a>). Two cell phenotypes, epithelial and non-epithelial cells, are specified during cleavage and early compaction within the zona pellucida. All the relevant genes required to maintain these cell shapes and behaviours are upregulated at these very early stages.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">Three lineages are set up at this time with the specification of trophoblast, hypoblast (primitive endoderm) and epiblast. Cells subsequently respond locally to their environment, specifically to other cells that are positioned lateral and basal to them. In the mouse embryo, the genes operating at these early times are given in <a href="#bib37" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_37">Takaoka and Hamada (2012)</a>. The implanting blastocyst also expresses and secretes miRNAs (involved in post-translational gene expression) involved in interactions with the maternal endometrium which secretes similar molecules (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Lian et al 2017</a>): successful embryo–maternal cross-talk is vital for implantation.</div><div class="text" id="p0020">Two related themes have emerged from experimental studies of development: the control of embryonic morphology has been highly conserved in evolution between vertebrates and invertebrates; this control involves families of genes coding for proteins that act as transcriptional regulators. Homeobox genes are believed to be responsible, at least in part, for the evolutionary origin of the embryonic body plan (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Irie and Kuratani 2014</a>) and for appropriate axial elongation of the embryo and limb specification (<a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_10">Deschamps and Duboule 2017</a>). Experimental studies of transgenic animals in which the homeobox genes have been knocked out provide some evidence of their function. However, because developmental processes permit significant recovery from insult, some of the outcomes cannot be directly interpreted as demonstrating the effect of such gene loss. Other gene families required for normal development include the T-box family (helix–loop–helix transcription factors and <span class="italic">Sox</span> genes) and the signalling factors transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), fibroblast growth factor family (FGF), the Wnt family and Hedgehog signalling molecules. A range of cell receptor molecules are also required. For details on individual members within this range of factors, see <a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_3">Carlson (2014)</a>.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">The successful culture of embryonic stem cells, the techniques of single-cell RNA-sequencing, analysis of all proteins expressed by early embryonic cells, the transcription factors they express, the molecules they secrete and those produced as metabolites, have generated extensive data on early genes and the control of sequential expression of genes specific to diverging cell phenotypes (<a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_14">Giacomini et al 2017</a>).</div><section><a id="s0015"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0025">Signalling between embryonic cells and tissues</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0030">Within the developing blastocyst, the position of cells relative to each other leads to epigenetic change. The acquisition of cell polarity is fundamental, because this specifies apical and basolateral domains, cell surface specializations, the positioning of intracellular organelles and cytoskeletal elements, and the position and nature of cell–cell junctions. The establishment cell junctional complexes between the outer, polarized, cells of the morula within the zona pellucida are the earliest embryonic cell interactions. The signals received by adjacent cells induces a change in their subsequent behaviour. Cellular signalling between cells and tissues occur via: direct cell–cell contact (gap junctions); cell adhesion molecules and their receptors; extracellular matrix molecules and their receptors; and growth factors and their receptors. The production of a basal lamina by epithelial cells (containing, e.g., laminin and fibronectin) and its attachment to underlying extracellular matrix molecules (collagen, proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans) synthesized by mesenchyme cells constructs the tissues in which reciprocal signalling occurs (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 11.1</span></a>). In most developing tissues an epithelium and its basal lamina are supported by underlying mesenchymal cells, each contributing to developmental interactions. However, there are a few sites where two epithelial layers, a special epithelium and an endothelium, generate a shared basement membrane to which both epithelial phenotypes contribute. This arrangement is seen between type-1 pneumocytes and endothelium in the developing lung alveoli; between the podocytes and endothelium in the glomerulus of the developing kidney; and between astrocyte end feet and pial-derived endothelium in the developing brain (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 11.2</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000112/main.assets/f11-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 11.1</span> The many ways by which mesenchyme cells could signal to epithelial cells.

The transient production of, e.g., gap junctions is seen as epithelial somites are formed; between neuroepithelial cells within rhombomeres; and in the tunica media of the outflow tract of the heart. Mutations of the genes that code for extracellular matrix molecules give rise to a number of congenital disorders, e.g. mutations in type I collagen produce osteogenesis imperfecta; mutations in type II collagen produce disorders of cartilage; and mutations in fibrillin are associated with Marfan syndrome</div><div class="text" id="p0040">Growth factors are distinguished from extracellular matrix molecules. They can be delivered to, and act on, cells in a variety of ways, namely: endocrine, autocrine, paracrine, intracrine, juxtacrine or matricrine (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 11.3</span></a>). Many growth factors are secreted in a latent form, e.g. associated with a propeptide (latency-associated peptide) in the case of transforming growth factor beta, or attached to a binding protein, in the case of insulin-like growth factors.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0020"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000112/main.assets/f11-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0020"/><a id="fspara0020"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 11.3</span> In addition to the mechanisms described in <a href="#f0010">Fig. 11.1</a>, cells may also communicate by the reception, production and secretion of growth factors.

Stiffness of the matrix leads cells towards an osteoblastic developmental phenotype, whereas soft matrix leads to an adipocyte lineage (<a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Heisenberg and Bellaïche 2013</a>). Endogenous electrical fields are also believed to have a role in cell–cell communication and have been demonstrated in a range of amphibian embryos, and in vertebrate embryos during primitive streak ingression. Neuroepithelial cells are electrically coupled, regardless of their position relative to inter-rhombomeric boundaries.</div><div class="text" id="p0050">The spatial and temporal distribution of a variety of cell adhesion molecules has been localized in the early embryo and displayed within the 3D tissue arrangement of embryos at a variety of stages (MGI mouse gene expression data search: <a href="https://www.emouseatlas.org/emage/home.php">eMAGE</a>). The temporal appearance of these molecules correlates with a variety of morphogenetic events that involve cell aggregation or disaggregation.</div><div class="text" id="p0055">It is important to realize that while developmental studies on laboratory species and <span class="italic">in vitro</span> studies of animal tissues indicate the range of factors operating in embryos, the spatial and temporal expression of these factors in human embryos will be different. <a href="../B9780702077050000082/B9780702077050000082.xhtml#f0015">Figure 8.2</a> illustrates the temporal differences in external features between human and some animal species. Differences in heterochrony (the time at which genes are expressed and specific structures develop), are easily appreciated between mammals and marsupials, where marsupial embryos are born with facial and upper limb development well in advance of mammals of a similar developmental age (<a href="#bib5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_5">Chew et al 2014</a>). Although not so extreme, differences in heterochrony are significant between human and mouse embryos and any extrapolation of animal developmental sequences to human development should be avoided. Somite generation frequency is 5 hours in humans and 2 hours in mice, and other processes, such as progenitor cell population expansion, have different time lines, e.g. generation of motor neurones takes 2–3 weeks in humans but a few days in mice (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Ebisuya and Briscoe 2018</a>). The way in which embryonic cells and tissues count time is not yet clear, but analyses and correlation of specific heterochronic interspecies differences are now being investigated at the molecular level.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="197" id="pagebreak_197"/><a id="pg197"/></div><section><a id="s0020"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0030">Induction and interactions</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0060">All cell signalling events form the basis of induction and are involved in cell–cell and tissue interactions. The sequential consequents of induction are described using specific terminology. The ability of a cell population (or tissue) to respond to an inductive signal is called <span class="italic">competence</span> and denotes the ability of the population to alter its initial behaviour as a result of the induction. After a cell population has been induced to develop along a certain pathway, it loses competence and becomes <span class="italic">restricted</span>. Once restricted, cells are set on a particular pathway of development and after a number of binary choices (further restrictions), they are said to be <span class="italic">determined</span>. Determined cells are programmed to follow a process of development that will lead to <span class="italic">differentiation</span>. The determined state is a heritable characteristic of cells and is the final step in restriction. Once a cell has become determined, it will progress to a differentiated phenotype if the environmental factors are suitable.</div><div class="text" id="p0065">The process of determination and differentiation within embryonic cell populations is reflected by the ability of these populations to produce specific proteins. Primary proteins (colloquially termed housekeeping proteins) are considered essential for cellular metabolism, whereas proteins synthesized as cells become determined, and are therefore specific to the state of determination, are termed secondary proteins; e.g. liver and kidney cells produce arginase, but muscle cells do not. Fully differentiated cells produce tertiary proteins, that no other cell line can synthesize, e.g. haemoglobin in erythrocytes. The range of housekeeping, regulatory, and tissue-specific proteomes in adult cells is presented in the Human Protein Atlas (<a href="http://www.proteinatlas.org/">www.proteinatlas.org</a>).<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="198" id="pagebreak_198"/><a id="pg198"/></div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0035">Permissive and instructive tissue interactions</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0070">Classically two types of cell and tissue interaction have been described, namely, permissive and instructive (<a href="#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_41">Wessells 1977</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0075">In a permissive interaction, a signal from an adjacent tissue is necessary for the successful self-differentiation of the responding tissue. This means that a particular cell population (or the matrix molecules secreted by the cells that it contains) will maintain mitotic activity in an adjacent cell population. Since a variety of different cell populations may permit a specific cell population to undergo mitosis and cell differentiation, no specific instruction or signal that might limit the developmental options of the responding tissue is involved; this signal therefore does not influence the developmental pathway selected and there is no restriction. The responding tissue has the intrinsic capacity to develop, and only needs appropriate environmental conditions in order to express this capacity. Permissive interactions often occur later in development, when a tissue whose fate has already been determined is maintained and stabilized by another.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">An instructive (directive) interaction (induction) changes the cell type of the responding tissue, so that the cell population becomes restricted. <a href="#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Wessells (1977)</a> proposed four general principles in most instructive interactions: in the presence of tissue A, responding tissue B develops in a certain way; in the absence of tissue A, responding tissue B does not develop in that way; in the absence of tissue A, but in the presence of tissue C, tissue B does not develop in that way; and in the presence of tissue A, a tissue D, which would normally develop differently, is changed to develop like tissue B.</div><div class="text" id="p0085">These principles are exemplified during induction of the lens vesicle by the optic cup (see <a href="../B978070207705000015X/B978070207705000015X.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 15.1</a>). An example of D is the experimental association of chicken flank ectoderm with mouse mammary mesenchyme, which results in the morphogenesis of mammary gland-like structures even though chickens do not normally develop mammary glands <a href="#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Wessells (1977)</a>.</div><div class="text" id="p0090">Tissue interactions continue into adult life and are probably responsible for maintaining the functional heterogeneity of adult tissues and organs, as exemplified by the complex tissue heterogeneity, with sharply compartmentalized boundaries, that occurs in the oral cavity. The junctions between the mucosa of the vestibule and the lip, and between the vermillion border and the facial skin, are distinct boundaries of specific epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation, and are almost certainly maintained by continuing epithelial–mesenchymal interactions in adult life. Perturbation of these interactions throughout the body may underlie a wide variety of adult diseases, including susceptibility to cancer and proliferative disorders.</div><div class="text" id="p0095">The interactions between adjacent epithelia and underlying connective tissue continue throughout embryonic and fetal life and extend into postnatal life.

The metabolic products of such cultures have been analysed through proteomic analysis (metabolome or secretome). Cells grown in 3D culture will form organoids, where epithelial cells, supported by outer mesenchymal cells form hollow spheres. If these self-organizing cell lines are implanted into animals they continue to grow; if maintained in 3D culture they can be used for drug testing or examination of transcription factors they release.

In contrast, morphogenetic mechanisms, which include the epigenetic context of cell populations, mechanical interactions between cells and also the ECM, and also the local properties of the ECM and its response to the local stresses, appear to generate more complex patterns using fewer genes.</div><div class="text" id="p0165">A cell population with equivalent states of gene expression, noted as a genetic territory (<a href="#bib30" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Salazar-Ciudad et al 2003</a>) can undergo an overall change in form. This has been termed a morphostatic mechanism: the population follows an autonomous and specific temporal sequence of behavioural changes specified by the expression of a new range of transcription factors, e.g. the meristematic growth of the developing limb bud (<a href="../B9780702077050000197/B9780702077050000197.xhtml">Ch. 19</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0170">Morphodynamic mechanisms denote cell populations where genetic territories are changing at the same time as the cells are sending and receiving inductive molecular signals. Inductive and morphogenetic mechanisms are working synchronously and interdependently. Cells are acquiring positional information dynamically and, because of the different relative positions of each cell to its neighbour, the local interpretations of any inductive signals to a cell population is complex, as cells interact with changing molecular and biomechanical microenvironments over time. Such mechanisms can be seen in cerebral development (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml">Ch. 14</a>).

This type of interaction is seen particularly in gut development, where joined linear sequences of epithelial: mesenchyme interactions are covered by a second epithelium. The elongation of the first tube is informed by its own genetic programme and also confined by the dynamic relationship with the outer epithelium. The biomechanical tension produced in the system informs regional lengthening, rate of growth of the original epithelial–mesenchyme interaction, and the local formation of complex looping. Differential growth between the epithelial layers in this system can give rise to complex coiling of the gut which can then slide into and pack closely within a restricted space. Although aspects of buckling morphogenesis can be predicted mathematically, the parameters for inclusion are extremely complex and not all of the mechanical properties of the tissues involved can yet be specified (<a href="#bib33" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Nerurkar et al 2017</a>, <a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Nerurkar et al 2019</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0075"/><section><a id="s0080"/><section><a id="s0085"/><h3 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0065">Experimental approaches to embryology</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0185">Study of the development of chimeric embryos, where small portions of an embryo are excised and replaced with similar portions of an embryo from a different species at the same stage, has provided significant advances in the understanding of conserved genes and interactive pathways.

They also provide a means of viewing all of the complex partonomy, lineage data and temporal information occurring within embryos within a specific timeframe and of linking these to adult anatomical tissue types. As understanding of the complexity of early developmental events expands, the use of ontological databases provide methods to correlate embryological information (limitations are discussed in <a href="#bib2" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_2">Bard 2012</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0215">Computer models have so far focused on single attributes of cells, such as their position, movement or forces transmitted through layers, e.g. cell position relative to a lattice, or the contact surfaces of a cell with other cells in 3D. Such models are more suited to densely packed epithelial cell populations than to mesenchymal populations where the viscoelastic properties of the glycosaminoglycans can be changed in three dimensions by mesenchymal cell–cell interaction or epithelial–mesenchymal interaction.

Internet websites contain the databases of genomes, spatial and temporal gene expressions, metabolomes and secretomes throughout the development of a range of invertebrate and vertebrate species (including Wormbase, Flybase, Mouse eMAP, KOMP (Knockout Mouse Project), and Human Developmental Studies Network – HUDSEN). Such ontologies assist embryological study, reveal explicit similarities in interspecies developmental processes and enhance the production of taxonomies of vertebrate evolution.</div><div class="text" id="p0225">Until fairly recently the study of embryology has been based on detailed examination of histological sections of embryos at different developmental stages: an understanding of cells, tissues and extracellular spaces in 3D; and the use of specific staining techniques to compare sections of normal, perturbed or chimeric embryos. Today many computer programs based on cell or gene ontologies, devised and specified some years ago, are making predictions about developmental mechanisms. New research outcomes are curated and updated in the main by other computer algorithms, with human curation of only a small proportion of the uploaded data. The concepts used to explain developmental processes have evolved in step with an increased understanding of gene expression, common embryonic mechanisms, cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions, and newly discovered transitory embryonic cell populations. However, it is perhaps now no longer possible to modify how embryonic processes are (re)conceptualized in the light of new knowledge, because the language used when computer ontologies were first devised cannot be revised. The earlier freedom for exploration of concepts and theories, their revision in the light of new discoveries and the development of new thoughts and language, may no longer be possible. As computers are now able to devise their own algorithms, learning from their past searches, the original concepts and thoughts concerning embryological mechanisms and interaction may become changed in ways not yet apparent, and certainly not transparent.</div><div class="text" id="p0230">Outcomes of studies based on analyses of Big Data in embryological studies and how they fit into the sum of knowledge may need caution in their interpretation (<a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Hutter and Moerman 2015</a>).
