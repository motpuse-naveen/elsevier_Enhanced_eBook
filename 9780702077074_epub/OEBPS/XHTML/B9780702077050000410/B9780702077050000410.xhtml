Extrinsic membranes connect the larynx to the hyoid bone and to the first tracheal ring; these are the thyrohyoid and cricotracheal membranes respectively. Intrinsic membranes connect the intrinsic laryngeal cartilages; these are the quadrangular membrane, whose lower free border forms the vestibular or false vocal folds and the cricothyroid ligament, and the conus elasticus, whose upper free border forms the vocal ligament of the true vocal folds. The laryngeal cavity is divided into three regions, the vestibule, ventricle and infraglottic cavity. Potential tissue spaces surround the cartilages and their anatomy is demonstrated using cross-sectional images.</p><p class="abspara" id="abspara0020">Movements of the laryngeal cartilages occur at the cricothyroid and cricoarytenoid joints and are effected by the intrinsic muscles of the larynx; these movements open and close the laryngeal inlet to allow for respiration and phonation respectively. In addition, movements of the cartilages and alterations in muscular contraction change the configuration and tension of the vocal folds, altering the voice quality and pitch. The anatomy of the joints and the muscles responsible for these movements is described.</p><p class="abspara" id="abspara0025">An overview of the anatomy of speech and the role of the larynx in the production of voice as well as other speech functions is presented.

It projects ventrally between the great vessels of the neck and is covered anteriorly by skin, fasciae and the infrahyoid strap muscles that lower the hyoid bone and the larynx. Above, it opens into the laryngopharynx and forms its anterior wall; below, it continues into the trachea (see <a href="../B9780702077050000409/B9780702077050000409.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 40.2</a>). It is mobile on deglutition. At rest, the larynx lies opposite the third to sixth cervical vertebrae in adult males; it is somewhat higher in children and adult females. In infants between 6 and 12 months, the tip of the epiglottis (the highest part of the larynx) lies a little above the junction of the dens and body of the axis vertebra (<a href="#bib59" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_59">Mijallili et al 2012</a>). Until puberty, male and female larynges are similar in size. After puberty, the male larynx enlarges considerably in comparison with that of the female; all the cartilages increase in both size and weight, the thyroid cartilage projects in the anterior midline of the neck, and its sagittal diameter nearly doubles. The male thyroid cartilage continues to increase in size until 40 years of age, after which no further growth occurs.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">For further reading, including an introduction to the more important historical literature, see <a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Berkovitz et al (2000)</a>, <a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Blitzer et al (2009)</a>, <a href="#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Dickson and Maue-Dickson (1982)</a>, <a href="#bib46" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_46">Kaplan (1971)</a>, <a href="#bib42" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_42">Hollinshead (1982)</a>, <a href="#bib90" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_90">Tucker (1993)</a>.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Skeleton of the Larynx</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0020">The skeletal framework of the larynx is formed by a series of cartilages interconnected by ligaments and fibrous membranes and moved by a number of muscles (<span class="bold"><a href="#f0010">Figs 41.1</a>–<a href="#f0020">41.3</a></span>).

Its free end, which is broad and round, and occasionally notched in the midline, is directed upwards. Its attached part, or stalk (petiole, petiolus), is long and narrow and is connected by the elastic thyroepiglottic ligament to the back of the laryngeal prominence of the thyroid cartilage just below the thyroid notch. Its sides are attached to the arytenoid cartilages by aryepiglottic folds (which contain the aryepiglottic muscle) (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 41.6</a>). Its free upper anterior, or lingual, surface is covered by mucosa (the epithelium is non-keratinized stratified squamous), which is reflected on to the pharyngeal aspect of the tongue and the lateral pharyngeal walls as a median glossoepiglottic, and two lateral glossoepiglottic, folds. This arrangement produces a depression, the vallecula, on each side between the median and lateral folds (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 41.5B</a>). The lower part of its anterior surface, behind the hyoid bone and thyrohyoid membrane, is connected to the upper border of the hyoid by an elastic hyoepiglottic ligament, and separated from the thyrohyoid membrane by adipose tissue, which constitutes the clinically important pre-epiglottic space (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 41.5</a>). The smooth posterior, or laryngeal, surface is transversely concave and vertically concavo-convex, and is covered by ciliated respiratory mucosa; its lower projecting part is called the tubercle. This surface forms the oblique anterior wall of the laryngeal vestibule. The cartilage is posteriorly pitted by small mucous glands (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 41.3D</span></a>) and is perforated <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="718" id="pagebreak_718"/><a id="pg718"/>by branches of the internal laryngeal nerve and fibrous tissue, which means that the posterior surface of the epiglottis is in continuity through these perforations with the pre-epiglottic space.</div><section><a id="s0020"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0030">Functions of the epiglottis</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0040">During swallowing, the hyoid bone moves upwards and forwards, and the epiglottis is bent posteriorly as a result of passive pressure from the base of the tongue and active contraction of the aryepiglottic muscles. Normally, the epiglottis diverts food and liquids away from the laryngeal inlet and into the lateral food channels. It is not essential for respiration or phonation.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">Whether downward movement of the epiglottis is a passive process, produced by a combination of the weight of food or liquid on its lingual surface and forces originating elsewhere in the hyoid and larynx, or whether it is an active process brought about by active muscular control, remains the subject of debate. Neither scheme seems to explain epiglottic movement satisfactorily. It is likely that a combination of processes is taking place, in which passive forces originating in the tongue, hyoid and larynx are transmitted to the epiglottis by the hyoepiglottic ligaments while the base of the epiglottis is actively moved by thyroarytenoid and muscles of the laryngeal inlet (<a href="#bib55" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_55">Logemann et al 1992</a>, <a href="#bib91" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_91">Vandaele et al 1994</a>). Safe swallowing is still possible without an epiglottis, as after a supraglottic laryngectomy, but great care and training is necessary.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="719" id="pagebreak_719"/><a id="pg719"/></div></section></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0035">Thyroid cartilage</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0050">The thyroid cartilage is the largest of the laryngeal cartilages (see <a href="#f0010">Figs 41.1</a>–<a href="#f0020">41.3</a>). It consists of two quadrilateral laminae with anterior borders that fuse along their inferior two-thirds at a median angle to form the subcutaneous laryngeal prominence (‘Adam’s apple’). This projection is most distinct at its upper end and is well marked in men but less visible in women. Above, the laminae are separated by a V-shaped superior thyroid notch or incisure. Posteriorly, the laminae diverge, and their posterior borders are prolonged as slender horns: the superior and inferior cornua. A shallow ridge, the oblique line, curves downwards and forwards on the external surface of each lamina; it runs from the superior thyroid tubercle, lying a little anterior to the root of the superior cornu, to the inferior thyroid tubercle on the inferior border of the lamina. Often, the oblique line is barely visible or is just a faint line and only the tubercles are prominent. Sternothyroid, thyrohyoid and thyropharyngeus (part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor) are attached to the oblique line, usually as little more than a tendon (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 41.3A</span></a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0055">The internal surface of the lamina is smooth. Above and behind, it is slightly concave and covered by mucosa. The thyroepiglottic ligament, the paired vestibular and vocal ligaments, the thyroarytenoid, thyroepiglottic and vocalis muscles, and the stalk of the epiglottis are all attached to the inner surface of the cartilage, in the angle between the laminae. The true vocal folds lie 6–9<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm below the median thyroid notch. The superior border of each lamina is concave posteriorly and convex anteriorly, dropping sharply to form the thyroid notch; the thyrohyoid membrane is attached along the superior border (see <a href="#f0010">Figs 41.1</a>–<a href="#f0015">41.2</a>). The inferior border of each lamina is concave posteriorly and nearly straight anteriorly; the two parts are separated by the inferior thyroid tubercle. Anteriorly, the thyroid cartilage is connected to the cricoid cartilage by the median (anterior) cricothyroid ligament, which is the thickened medial portion of the conus elasticus.</div><div class="text" id="p0060">The anterior border of each thyroid lamina fuses with its partner at an angle of approximately 90° in men and approximately 120° in women. The shallower angle in men is associated with the larger laryngeal prominence, the greater length of the vocal folds, and the resultant deeper pitch of the voice. The posterior border is thick and rounded and receives fibres of stylopharyngeus and palatopharyngeus. The superior cornu, which is long and narrow, curves upwards, backwards and medially, and ends in a conical apex to which the lateral thyrohyoid ligament is attached. The inferior cornu is short and thick, and curves down and slightly anteromedially. On the anteromedial surface of its lower end there is a small oval facet for articulation with the side of the cricoid cartilage; this facet is variable and is only sometimes well defined.</div></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0040">Cricoid cartilage</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0065">The cricoid cartilage is attached below to the trachea and articulates with the thyroid cartilage and the two arytenoid cartilages by synovial joints. It forms a complete ring around the airway, the only laryngeal cartilage to do so (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 41.3B</span></a>).

Cricothyroid is attached to the external aspect of its front and sides, and cricopharyngeus (part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor) is attached behind cricothyroid. The arch is palpable below the laryngeal prominence, from which it is separated by a depression containing the conus elasticus.

The inferior border of the cricoid is horizontal and joined to the first tracheal cartilage by the cricotracheal ligament (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 41.1</a>). The superior border runs obliquely up and back and gives attachment anteriorly to the thick median cricothyroid ligament, and laterally to the conus elasticus (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 41.1</a>) and lateral cricoarytenoid. The posterosuperior aspect of the lamina presents a shallow median notch, on each side of which is a smooth, oval, convex facet, directed upwards and laterally, for articulation with the base of an arytenoid cartilage.</div><div class="text" id="p0085">The internal surface of the cricoid cartilage is smooth and lined by mucosa.</div></section><section><a id="s0045"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0055">Subglottic stenosis</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0095">Subglottic stenosis is usually acquired by damage to the cricoid ring by prolonged intubation in premature babies (<a href="#bib95" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_95">Walner et al 2009</a>).

Each is pyramidal and has three surfaces, two processes, a base and an apex. The posterior surface, which is triangular, smooth and concave, is covered by the transverse arytenoid muscle. The anterolateral surface is convex and rough. Near the apex of the cartilage there is an elevation from which a crest curves back, down and then forwards to the vocal process.

The lower is oblong (fovea oblonga). Vocalis and thyroarytenoid are attached to it. The medial surface is narrow, smooth and flat, and is covered by mucosa; its lower edge forms the lateral boundary of the intercartilaginous part of the rima glottidis. The base is concave, with a smooth surface for articulation with the lateral part of the upper border of the cricoid lamina.

Both capsule and ligaments are rich in elastin fibres. The primary movement at the joint is rotation around a transverse axis that passes transversely through both cricothyroid joints. There is some controversy as to whether the cricoid or thyroid cartilage rotates more. The effect of this rotation is to move the cricoid and thyroid cartilages relative to one another in such a way as to bring together or approximate the lamina of the thyroid cartilage and the arch of the cricoid cartilage (‘closing the visor’). When the joint is in a neutral position, the ligaments are slack and the cricoid can glide, to a limited extent, in horizontal and vertical directions on the thyroid cornua. The effect of these movements is to lengthen the vocal folds, provided the arytenoid cartilages are stabilized at the cricoarytenoid joint. This may also increase vocal fold tension.

Each joint is enclosed by a capsular ligament and strengthened by a ligament that, although traditionally called the posterior cricoarytenoid ligament, is largely medial in position.</div><div class="text" id="p0150">The cricoid facets are elliptical, convex and obliquely directed laterally, anteriorly and downwards. The long axes of the two facets intersect posteriorly at an angle of about 50°. Two movements take place at this joint. The first is rotation of the arytenoid cartilages at right-angles to the long axis of the cricoid facet (dorso-medio-cranial to ventro-latero-caudal). This causes each vocal process to swing laterally or medially to increase or decrease the width of the rima glottidis. This movement is sometimes referred to as a rocking movement of the arytenoid cartilages. There is also a gliding movement, by which the arytenoids approach or recede from one another, the direction and slope of their articular surfaces imposing a forward and downward movement on lateral gliding. The movements of gliding and rotation are associated. Hence medial gliding happens with medial rotation and lateral gliding with lateral rotation. This results in adduction or abduction of the vocal folds respectively. When viewed from above, foreshortening can give the illusion that the arytenoid cartilages are rotating about their vertical axes, but the shape of the facets prevents such movement happening (<a href="#bib83" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_83">Selbie et al 1998</a>). Some authors maintain that rotatory movement about a vertical axis can take place (<a href="#bib53" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_53">Liu et al 2013</a>). The posterior cricoarytenoid ligaments limit forward movements of the arytenoid cartilages on the cricoid cartilage.

The lower pair are the (true) vocal folds (or vocal folds), and the aperture between them is the rima glottidis. The true vocal folds are the primary source of phonation, whereas the vestibular folds normally do not contribute directly to sound production. The supraglottis is a clinical term sometimes used in tumour staging; it refers to all those parts of the larynx that lie above the glottis and comprises the laryngeal inlet (formed of the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis and arytenoid cartilages, and the laryngeal aspects of the aryepiglottic folds), the laryngeal vestibule and the vestibular folds. Other terms that are used clinically in tumour staging are the glottis, defined as the anterior and inferior surfaces of the true vocal folds and the anterior and posterior commissures.

It lines the entire inner surface of the larynx, including the ventricle and saccule. The mucosa is thickened over the vestibular folds, where it is the chief component, and is thinner over the vocal folds, where it overlies the vocal ligaments. It is loosely adherent to the anterior surface of the epiglottis but firmly attached to the floor of the valleculae. On the aryepiglottic folds, it is reinforced by a considerable amount of fibrous connective tissue and it adheres closely to the laryngeal surfaces of the cuneiform and arytenoid cartilages.</div><div class="text" id="p0230">The laryngeal epithelium is mainly a ciliated, pseudostratified respiratory epithelium (see <a href="../B9780702077050000021/B9780702077050000021.xhtml#f0015">Fig. 2.2D</a>) where it covers the inner aspects of the larynx, including the lower part of the posterior, laryngeal surface of the epiglottis. It provides a mucociliary clearance mechanism shared with most of the respiratory tract. The vocal folds are covered by non-keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium where they contact each other. This important variation protects the tissue from the effects of the considerable mechanical stresses that act on the surfaces of the vocal folds. Certain parts of the larynx are subject to the abrasive effects of swallowed food and are also covered by non-keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium. These are the ‘exterior’ surfaces of the larynx, which merge with the laryngopharynx and oropharynx (including the anterior, lingual and upper, posterior surfaces of the epiglottis and the upper parts of the aryepiglottic folds) (<a href="#bib78" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_78">Sato 2018</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0235">The laryngeal mucosa has numerous mucous glands, especially over the epiglottis, where the cartilage is pitted, and along the margins of the aryepiglottic folds anterior to the arytenoid cartilages, where they are known as the arytenoid glands. Many large glands in the saccules of the larynx secrete periodically over the vocal folds during phonation. Seromucinous tubule-alveolar glands in the saccule, posterior surface of the epiglottis and the aryepiglottic folds, and goblet cells all secrete mucus in the respiratory epithelium. The free edges of the vocal folds are devoid of glands, and their stratified epithelium is vulnerable to drying and requires the secretions of neighbouring glands. The epithelial surfaces of the vocal folds are lined by microvilli that may retain the lubricating secretions and help to ensure an even distribution of mucus. Poorly lubricated folds would appear to increase resistance to airflow, which means that higher subglottal pressures are needed to initiate and sustain phonation. Taste buds, like those in the tongue, are present on the posterior epiglottic surface and aryepiglottic folds, and less often in other laryngeal regions. Laryngeal stretch-, touch- and pressure-sensitive mechanoreceptors provide perceptual and proprioceptive afferent information for a variety of essential functions, including airway protection, breathing, deglutition, speech and voice (<a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">Hammer and Krueger 2014</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0175"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0170">Upper part</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0240">The upper part of the laryngeal cavity consists of the laryngeal inlet (aditus), the aryepiglottic fold and the laryngeal vestibule.</div><section><a id="s0180"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0175">Laryngeal inlet (aditus)</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0245">The upper part of the laryngeal cavity is entered by the laryngeal inlet (aditus laryngis), an approximately triangular aperture between the larynx and pharynx.

The inlet is bounded anteriorly by the upper edge of the epiglottis, posteriorly by the transverse mucosal fold between the two arytenoids (posterior commissure), and on each side by the edge of a mucosal ridge, the aryepiglottic fold, that runs between the side of the epiglottis and the apex of the arytenoid cartilage.

A laryngocele is a herniation of the saccular mucosa. The aetiology is uncertain: repeated, sustained high transglottal pressures (such as in trumpet playing) may be a possible cause of acquired symptoms, and some cases may be the result of congenital enlargement of the saccule. Growth of a laryngocele is constrained by the surrounding tissues, and so it expands upwards into the paraglottic space anterior to the piriform fossa, and superiorly to expand the aryepiglottic fold and reach the vallecula (internal laryngocele). It can extend to the thyrohyoid membrane, which it may pierce to form an external laryngocele, and where it may be palpable in the neck. Symptoms include hoarseness, stridor and dysphagia. The laryngeal saccule may also become pathologically enlarged as a result of obstruction of the ventricular aditus by inflammation, scarring, or compression by a tumour. An expanding, mucus-filled cyst forms as the glandular secretions accumulate: saccular cysts can expand in a similar direction to a laryngocele and may also pierce the thyrohyoid membrane. In addition to hoarseness and stridor, acute respiratory obstruction may result if the contents of the cyst become infected, especially in the young.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0220"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0215">Vocal folds and ligaments</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0295">The vocal folds serve several functions. They protect the airway by closing during swallowing; they are responsible for generation of a cough by closing firmly and then moving rapidly apart during exhalation; they facilitate the Valsalva manoeuvre by closing the glottis and raising intrathoracic pressure, hence also increasing intra-abdominal pressure, such as during defaecation, parturition, or lifting heavy weights; and they are concerned with sound production. The free thickened upper edge of the conus elasticus forms the vocal ligament (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 41.5C</a>). It stretches back on either side from the midlevel of the thyroid angle to the vocal processes and fovea oblonga of the arytenoids. When covered by mucosa, it is termed the vocal fold or vocal cord (vocal fold is the preferred clinical term) (see <a href="#f0030">Figs 41.5B</a>, <a href="#f0035">41.6</a>). The vocal folds lie on either side of an aperture, the rima glottidis, and form the anterolateral three-fifths of its edges. The posterior two-fifths of the edges of the rima glottidis are formed by the medial surfaces of the arytenoid cartilages including the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages.</div><div class="text" id="p0300">Each vocal fold consists of five layers: mucosal epithelium, lamina propria (which has three layers) and a muscular layer (fibres of thyroarytenoid and vocalis) (<a href="#f0040"><span class="bold">Fig. 41.7</span></a>). The mucosa overlying the vocal ligament is thin and the epithelial cell layer is attached to the underlying superficial lamina propria by a basement membrane.

The most superficial layer (also known as Reinke’s space) is hypocellular and consists mainly of loose fine collagen (reticular fibres) and elastic fibres. It is only loosely attached to the underlying vocal ligament that extends along the length of the free margin of the vocal ligament and a little way onto the superior surface of the fold; oedema readily collects here in disease.

The vocal folds are connected to the thyroid cartilage anteriorly via the anterior maculae flavae and the anterior commissure tendon, and posteriorly via the posterior maculae flavae. The maculae flavae themselves are described as being formed of dense masses of stellate cells with a morphology markedly different from that of fibroblasts, surrounded by a dense extracellular matrix. The function of the maculae flavae remains unclear but it has been suggested that they play a critical role in the metabolism of the extracellular matrix of the vocal folds (<a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Awd Allah et al 2009</a>, <a href="#bib30" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_30">Fayoux et al 2004</a>, <a href="#bib81" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_81">Sato et al 2010a</a>, <a href="#bib82" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_82">2010b</a>, <a href="#bib78" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Sato 2018</a>).</div><section><a id="s0225"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0220">Laryngeal carcinoma</h5><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="725" id="pagebreak_725"/></div><div class="textfl" id="p0325">Squamous cell carcinoma is by far the most common laryngeal malignancy. The pattern of spread is determined by anatomical features at the site of origin and this influences its management and potential outcomes (<a href="#bib48" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_48">Kirchner and Carter 1987</a>, <a href="#bib98" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_98">Welsh et al 1989</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0330">Supraglottic tumours arising from the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis can spread through the perforations in the epiglottic cartilage and into the pre-epiglottic space. Because the supraglottis is not directly involved in voice production, tumours in this area most commonly present with a feeling of a persistent lump in the throat and possibly pain on swallowing often radiating to the ipsilateral ear. It is only in the later stages that they present with airway obstruction. If the tumour has spread towards the vocal fold, hoarseness will also be present. Inferior spread into the paraglottic space is more common and may extend as far as the subglottis or even beyond the larynx. Spread in this space medializes the vocal fold, as can be seen on careful laryngoscopy when assessing the tumour stage, and subsequently confirmed by scans. Lateral spread into the piriform sinus is a feature of tumours that arise lower down in the supraglottis on the vestibular folds. Deeper invasion infiltrates the thyroarytenoid muscle, fixing the fold, and eventually the thyroid and arytenoid cartilages.</div><div class="text" id="p0335">Ventricular tumours often obstruct mucus outflow from the saccule to cause a saccular cyst or mucocele. Further infiltration of the paraglottic space and transglottic spread ultimately fixes the vocal fold through muscle invasion and, more rarely, direct involvement of the cricoarytenoid joint or infiltration of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Fixation of the vocal fold is a good indicator of a tumour within the paraglottic space and this is reflected in the TNM staging system as an adverse sign.</div><div class="text" id="p0340">Tumours of the true vocal folds almost always present in the first instance with voice change (dysphonia). Glottic tumours tend to spread by local growth in the first instance, when they may be contained in Reinke's space for some time. The paucity of lymphatics in the vocal fold slows tumour progression, allowing time for the patient to present to a clinician with a relatively small tumour load that will only have caused a chronic husky voice. This anatomical feature also accounts for the relative lack of nodal metastases associated with small glottic tumours. The proximity of anterior fold tumours to the thyroid cartilages, separated only by a thin layer of connective tissue, predisposes to cartilage invasion. Spread of tumour via Broyles’ ligament to the outside of the larynx changes the tumour stage from a T1 lesion to a T4 lesion, with both therapeutic and survival implications. More posterior fold tumours tend to invade the vocalis muscle and fix it.</div><div class="text" id="p0345">Subglottic tumours tend to spread circumferentially and, by so doing, impair the airway dramatically. The management of laryngeal carcinomas is largely dictated by the stage at presentation. Very small tumours of the glottis can be resected or treated by radiotherapy. Organ sparing protocols using radiotherapy and sometimes chemotherapy are often employed for larger tumours in the first instance. Surgical resection, laryngectomy, is indicated for those with advanced disease that have nodal metastases and also for salvage when other therapies have failed.</div></section><section><a id="s0230"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0225">Reinke's oedema</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0355">Any oedema in the superficial lamina propria (Reinke’s space) is termed Reinke’s oedema. It results in an increase in density of the vocal fold, and hence a drop in the pitch of the voice. The oedema can persist because there is very poor lymphatic drainage from the edges of the vocal folds (<a href="#bib54" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_54">Liu et al 2006</a>).

Nodules normally develop at the point of maximum contact of the vocal folds, i.e. at the junction of the anterior third and the posterior two-thirds of the vocal ligament. Excessive trauma at this point, e.g. when singing with poor technique or forcing the voice, initially produces subepithelial haemorrhage or bruising. Over time this results in pathological changes such as subepithelial scarring (singer’s or screamer’s nodes). Nodules increase vocal fold mass and affect vocal fold closure; the persistent posterior glottal opening causes hoarseness, a breathy voice, reduced vocal intensity and an inability to produce higher frequencies of vibration. These changes can cause a cycle in which increasing vocal effort is required by way of compensation, and this exacerbates the problem (<a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">Aronson and Bless 2009</a>).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0240"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0235">Rima glottidis</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0370">The rima glottidis is the aperture between the vocal folds anteriorly and the arytenoid cartilages posteriorly (<a href="#f0045"><span class="bold">Fig. 41.8</span></a>).

Its walls are lined by respiratory mucosa and are supported by the cricothyroid ligament above and the cricoid cartilage below (<a href="#bib71" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_71">Reidenbach 1998</a>). The walls of this part of the laryngeal cavity are said to be exponentially curved, a feature that may serve to accelerate the airflow towards the glottis with the minimum loss of energy (<a href="#bib51" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Lenneberg 1967</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0250"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0245">Laryngoscopic examination</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0380">The laryngeal inlet, the structures around it, and the cavity of the larynx can all be inspected using flexible endoscopy, usually via the nasal cavity and nasopharynx.

From the epiglottic margins, the aryepiglottic folds can be traced posteromedially and the cuneiform and corniculate elevations recognized. The pink vestibular folds and pearly white vocal folds are easily seen.

Large foreign bodies may obstruct the laryngeal inlet or rima glottidis and suffocation may ensue. Smaller particles may enter the trachea or bronchi, or lodge in the laryngeal ventricle and cause reflex closure of the glottis, termed laryngospasm. Inflammation of the upper larynx, e.g. secondary to infection or the effects of smoke inhalation, may swell the mucosa by effusion of fluid into the loose submucous tissue (oedema of the supraglottis). The effusion neither involves nor extends below the vocal folds because the mucosa here is bound directly to the vocal ligaments and there is no submucous tissue. Laryngotomy below the vocal folds through the cricothyroid ligament, or tracheotomy below the cricoid cartilage, may be necessary to bypass the obstruction above and restore ventilation.</div><div class="text" id="p0390">The consequences of trauma to the larynx resulting from either blunt or penetrating injuries may lead to any or all of the following: oedema, haematoma, fracture, dislocations or paralysis. Trauma at the level of the rima glottidis may result in thyroid cartilage fracture and displacement of the fragments into the vocal folds posteriorly with consequent oedema. Suicidal wounds are usually made through the thyrohyoid membrane, damaging the epiglottis, superior thyroid vessels, external and internal carotid arteries, and internal jugular veins. Less frequently, these wounds are inflicted above the hyoid, so that the lingual muscles, lingual and facial vessels are damaged. Caustic substances swallowed accidentally or during a suicide attempt, the ingestion of hot liquids and the inspiration of hot gases may all result in serious laryngeal damage. Radiotherapy as part of the treatment for neck cancer can cause radiation burns within the larynx (<a href="#bib64" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_64">Myer 2004</a>).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0260"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0255">The Paediatric Larynx</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0395">The paediatric larynx differs markedly from its adult counterpart in size, position, consistency and shape. Although it is about one-third adult size, it is proportionately larger: the lumen is short and funnel-shaped, and disproportionately narrower. The infant larynx lies higher in the neck than the adult larynx (see <a href="../B9780702077050000409/B9780702077050000409.xhtml#f0070">Fig. 40.11</a>). At rest, the upper border of the infant epiglottis is at the level of the second or third cervical vertebra, and when the larynx is elevated, it reaches the level of the first cervical vertebra. This high position enables an infant to use its nasal airway to breathe while suckling. It also means that the larynx is protected somewhat by the jaw. The epiglottis is X-shaped, with a furled petiole, and the laryngeal cartilages are softer and more pliable than in the adult larynx (which may predispose to airway collapse in inspiration, leading to the clinical picture of laryngomalacia). The thyroid cartilage is shorter and broader, lies closer to the hyoid bone in the neonate and has a relatively short thyrohyoid ligament. Neither the superior notch nor the laryngeal prominence is as marked as it is in the adult. The cricoid cartilage is the same shape as in the adult. Calcification of the cricoid cartilage has been noted as early as 7 years of age (<a href="#bib86" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_86">Strauss 2000</a>). The arytenoid cartilages are larger in proportion to the larynx as a whole <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="726" id="pagebreak_726"/>and so are more prominent; the aryepiglottic folds are disproportionately large. The vocal folds are 4–4.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm long, which is relatively shorter than either in childhood or in the adult, and consequently the proportion of the rima glottidis that is intramembranous is smaller in the neonate. The ventricle of the larynx is small, whereas the saccule of the larynx is often considerably larger than it is in adult life.</div><div class="text" id="p0400">The mucosa of the vestibule is more loosely attached than it is in the adult larynx and it exhibits multiple submucosal glands. Inflammation of the vestibule can result in rapid and severe oedema. The mucosa is also lax in the infraglottic cavity and swelling here rapidly causes severe respiratory obstruction because of the disproportionately narrower lumen (3.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm in diameter in neonates).

The infraglottic airway rapidly increases in size during the first two years of life (<a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_28">Eckel et al 1999</a>). By about the third year, sexual differences become apparent: the larynx is larger in boys, although the angle between the thyroid laminae is more pronounced in girls. At puberty, these changes increase and there is greater enlargement of the male larynx.</div><div class="text" id="p0405">Congenital anomalies of the larynx include aplasia and hypoplasia of the epiglottis, high-rising epiglottis, bifid epiglottis, saccular cysts, vocal fold palsy, laryngeal atresia, laryngocele, laryngo-tracheo-oesophageal cleft and laryngeal web. Laryngo-tracheo-oesophageal cleft is due to failure of fusion of the posterior cricoid lamina and abnormal development of the tracheo-oesophageal septum, resulting in a posterior sagittal communication between the larynx and pharynx.

This tends to raise both the formant frequencies as well as the fundamental frequency and may be one way by which an increase in pitch is achieved, though a change in pitch is not an inevitable consequence of this movement. The raising of the larynx may also be accompanied by forward or backward movement of the tongue because of the attachment of the tongue to the hyoid bone.

The posterior and lateral cricoarytenoids and oblique and transverse interarytenoids vary the degree of abduction and adduction of the vocal folds and thus the dimensions and the degree of opening of the rima glottidis. The cricothyroids, posterior cricoarytenoids, thyroarytenoids and vocalis regulate the length and tension of the vocal folds. In reality, the obliquity of the cricoarytenoid facets means that some overlap in function between these two muscle groups is inevitable. Thus, alterations in the dimensions of the rima glottidis will produce small changes in vocal fold length and shortening the vocal folds will also result in a degree of adduction. The third group of muscles is the oblique arytenoids, aryepiglottic and thyroepiglottic muscles, which modify the laryngeal inlet. Bilateral pairs of muscles usually act in concert with each other.</div><div class="text" id="p0475">Neuromuscular spindles have been found in all human laryngeal muscles, the maximum number being found in the transverse interarytenoid (<a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Blitzer et al 2009</a>).

Rotation happens at the cricothyroid joint (see above). At the same time, the posterior part of cricothyroid pulls the thyroid cartilage forwards, a gliding action that also lengthens the vocal folds. In increasing the tension of the vocal folds, the pitch (frequency) of the voice rises. Some authors consider that cricothyroid has a slight adductive action in moving the vocal folds to a more paramedian position as they are lengthened and thinned (<a href="#bib62" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_62">Mu and Sanders 2009</a>, <a href="#bib94" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_94">Wadie et al 2013</a>).

The lower and more medial fibres form a band that, in coronal section, appears as a triangular bundle attached to the lateral surface of the vocal process and to the fovea oblonga on the anterolateral surface of the arytenoid cartilage. This bundle, the vocalis muscle, is viewed by some authors as simply a medial part of the thyroarytenoid and by others as a distinct and separate muscle. The vocalis is parallel with, and just lateral to, the vocal ligament. It is said to be thicker behind than in front, because many deeper fibres start from the vocal ligament and do not extend to the thyroid cartilage. (An alternative view is that all its fibres loop and intertwine as they pass from the thyroid to the arytenoid cartilage.) A few fibres extend along the wall of the ventricle from the lateral margin of the arytenoid cartilage to the side of the epiglottis.

All the intrinsic muscles of the larynx are supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve except for cricothyroid, which is supplied by the external laryngeal nerve. A number of anastomoses between the internal, external and recurrent laryngeal nerves have been described, with varying estimates of their incidence. Chronologically, the oldest recorded is that between the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the internal laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (Galen's anastomosis). The majority of these anastomoses are found on the posterior surface of the larynx, forming what has been described as a laryngeal plexus to parallel the pharyngeal plexus.

A communicating nerve continues from the posterior surface of cricothyroid, crosses the piriform fossa and enters thyroarytenoid, where it anastomoses with branches from the recurrent laryngeal nerve. It has been suggested that these communicating branches may provide both additional motor components to thyroarytenoid and sensory fibres to the mucosa in the region of the subglottis.

It supplies cricopharyngeus as it passes. At this point, the nerve is in intimate proximity to the posteromedial aspect of the thyroid gland. The main trunk divides into two or more branches, usually below the lower border of the inferior constrictor, although branching may take place higher up. The anterior branch is mainly motor and is sometimes called the inferior laryngeal nerve (although this term is best avoided to prevent any confusion with a former synonym for the recurrent laryngeal nerve), while the posterior branch is mainly sensory. The anterior branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve ascends posterior to the cricothyroid joint and its ligament (<a href="#bib84" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_84">Shindo et al 2005</a>). It is usually covered by fibres of posterior cricoarytenoid at this point. It bends over the joint, continuing forwards over the lateral cricoarytenoid muscle before terminating within thyroarytenoid. The anterior branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve first innervates posterior cricoarytenoid by one or more branches, then innervates interarytenoid and lateral cricoarytenoid, and terminates in thyroarytenoid, which it also supplies (see also <a href="#bib57" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_57">Maranillo et al 2005</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0690">The recurrent laryngeal nerve forms several anastomoses with the superior laryngeal nerves (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 41.12</a>).

The ansa Galeni, lying on the interarytenoid muscles, forms a direct connection between the recurrent and internal laryngeal nerves (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 41.12</a>).

On the right, it is as often anterior to, or posterior to, or intermingled with, the terminal branches of the artery.

The anterior layer covers the entire medial surface of each lobe. At, or just above, the isthmus, this layer is conspicuously thickened to form the lateral ligament of the thyroid gland, which attaches the gland to the trachea and the lower part of the cricoid cartilage. The posterior layer passes behind the oesophagus and pharynx to become attached to the prevertebral fascia. A compartment is thus formed on each side of the midline, lateral to the trachea and oesophagus; it contains fat, the recurrent laryngeal nerve and terminal parts of the inferior thyroid artery.

Only the right side is affected, and it is always associated with an abnormal origin of the right subclavian artery from the aortic arch on the left side. If unrecognized, a non-recurrent laryngeal nerve may be susceptible to injury during surgery.

Collectively, these nerves innervate the muscles of the larynx, soft palate and pharynx, and injury may therefore have deleterious effects on phonation and/or soft palate movements and/or swallowing. A lesion of the vagus nerve above the level at which the pharyngeal branch is given off will affect both the superior and recurrent laryngeal nerves. This causes immobility of the vocal fold on the affected side and imparts a breathy voice with lack of pitch and limited loudness. The affected fold is paralysed and lies in the so-called ‘cadaveric’ position halfway between abduction and adduction. If the lesion is unilateral, the voice is weak and hoarse, but if it is bilateral, phonation is almost absent, the vocal pitch cannot be altered, and the cough is weak and ineffective. There will also be a degree of hypernasality because of the effects on movements of the soft palate caused by paralysis of levator veli palatini. Unilateral palsies impact very significantly on the quality of life of the patient because of impaired vocalization and a tendency to aspirate. Bilateral palsies are extremely serious and a tracheostomy may be required to protect the airway.</div><div class="text" id="p0720">A lesion affecting the superior laryngeal nerve may be unilateral or bilateral. Complete section is most likely during the ligation of the vessels forming the vascular pedicle of the superior pole of the thyroid gland during thyroid lobectomy. Unilateral lesions may result in the vocal folds appearing relatively normal and the effect on voice is barely noticeable and is often overlooked. A more detailed examination may detect some shortening of the vocal folds on the affected side with asymmetric tilt of the epiglottis and the anterior larynx canted towards the unaffected side. The result is a mildly hoarse voice with loss of pitch control. Bilateral superior laryngeal nerve lesions result in shortening of both vocal folds, the overhanging of the epiglottis over the folds and reduced tilt between the thyroid and cricoid cartilage. Effects on the voice are correspondingly greater, with reduced loudness and pitch but variable breathiness.</div><div class="text" id="p0725">Damage to the internal laryngeal nerve causes loss of mechanoreceptive and proprioceptive sensation from the larynx. Unilateral loss produces a feeling that something is stuck in the throat, whereas bilateral loss will result in aspiration and can cause dysphagia, with a risk of choking.</div><div class="text" id="p0730">Unilateral complete palsy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve is more common on the left side, presumably because the nerve is longer on this side. There is isolated paralysis of all the laryngeal muscles on the affected side except cricothyroid, which is innervated by the external laryngeal nerve. The patient may be asymptomatic or have a hoarse, breathy voice and there will be diminished ability to manipulate pitch. The hoarseness may be permanent or may become less severe with time as the contralateral fold develops the ability to hyperadduct and oppose the paralysed fold, thereby closing the glottis during phonation and coughing, although this is seldom enough to restore full voice quality. There may be aspiration of food and drink. Bilateral lesions of the recurrent laryngeal nerve result in both vocal folds being paralysed and taking up a paramedian position. Phonation can be nearly normal because the vocal folds lie so close to the midline, but there will be audible stridor and a compromised airway.</div><div class="text" id="p0735">Clinically, the position of the vocal fold in the acute phase after section of the recurrent laryngeal nerve is very variable. Though stridor is more common after bilateral lesions and sometimes only audible to the educated ear, the folds may be sufficiently abducted so that there is little problem with airway obstruction at rest, although the voice is always weaker in this situation. The folds are slightly more widely separated in chronic lesions, which renders the voice weaker but with a less precarious airway. Atrophy and fibrosis of paraglottic muscles probably affect the position of paralysed vocal folds in chronic lesions to a greater degree than variations in the strength of the apposing adductor and abductor muscle groups.</div><div class="text" id="p0740">For many years, conventional wisdom held that movements of abduction were affected to a greater degree than those of adduction when the recurrent laryngeal nerve was partially damaged (Semon's law). This effect was thought to reflect the internal segregation within the recurrent laryngeal nerve of axons supplying the laryngeal abductor muscles. The hypothesis was later undermined by the demonstration that axons destined for particular laryngeal muscles are randomly distributed within the nerve. The weak abductive action of cricothyroid that is said to produce lengthening of the vocal folds has been suggested as the explanation for the relative sparing of abduction in these lesions, but is difficult to reconcile with the alternative view that cricothyroid may be a slight adductor of the vocal folds (<a href="#bib62" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Mu and Sanders 2009</a>, <a href="#bib94" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Wadie et al 2013</a>).

Thus, the glottis is opened widely during ventilation and is closed tightly during swallowing. The larynx can also close tightly during exertion (effort closure) to regulate thoracic and abdominal pressure during activities such as defecation or parturition, or to fix the thorax to increase mechanical advantage when using the arms to lift objects. The importance of the latter activity should not be underestimated. One of the many problems reported by patients who have undergone a laryngectomy is a loss of power in their arms when trying to lift heavy objects.</div><div class="text" id="p0755">The larynx is much more than a simple valve that opens and closes. In addition to its sphincteric functions, its location means that it is perfectly placed to act as a sound source, or voice, that forms the basis of many sounds in human speech. The musculoskeletal structure of the larynx is under exquisite neuromuscular control, allowing it to modify the expiratory stream to produce highly complex patterns of sound of varying loudness, frequency and duration. The ability to execute these complex movements depends largely on specific areas of the cerebral hemispheres that are involved in the motor aspects of language, such as speech and writing, and sensory manifestations of language, including reading and understanding the spoken word. Central control of voice production involves two parallel pathways: a limbic pathway responsible for the control of innate non-verbal and emotional vocalizations, and a larynx-specific motor cortical pathway responsible for regulating the motor control necessary for voluntary voice production.

For all sounds in Western European languages, and most sounds in other languages, this energy takes the form of a pulmonary expiration. This continuous airflow is converted into a vibration within the larynx by a mechanism called phonation, in which the vocal folds vibrate periodically, interrupting the column of air as it leaves the lungs and converting it into a series of discrete puffs of air. Speech sounds that are produced by vocal fold vibration in this way are said to be voiced. Speech sounds that are produced without vocal fold vibration are termed unvoiced sounds.</div><div class="text" id="p0770">The larynx is an inadequate sound source to produce the complex sounds required for comprehensible speech; the laryngeal ‘buzz’ that is produced by phonation is very quiet and cannot be varied sufficiently to produce the complex range of sounds that is human speech. Amplification and modification of the sound takes place in the supralaryngeal vocal tract, which may be considered as a 17<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm long tube, narrow at the larynx and broadening out proximally as it passes through the pharynx, oral and nasal cavities. This tube acts as a passive amplifier of the sound. (The analogy here is of a megaphone: cupping the hands round the lips lengthens the vocal tract and increases the volume of speech.) The supralaryngeal vocal tract modifies the basic vibration of the larynx by altering its geometry, length and calibre: it provides a series of resonators that can dampen or amplify certain sound frequencies and can transiently interrupt the exhaled air flow and modify it to produce speech. This process is known as articulation. The range of sounds that the human vocal tract is capable of producing is very wide, although any one human language <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="733" id="pagebreak_733"/><a id="pg733"/>will employ a subset of these sounds to convey meaning. The study of the integration of laryngeal sound production and articulation to produce complex speech is known as phonetics.</div></section><section><a id="s0600"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0515">Muscular control of the airstream</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0775">Normal vegetative ventilation involves rhythmic movements of the thoracic cage that are produced by intercostal muscles, the diaphragm and a number of accessory muscles in the neck, arm and abdomen that have one attachment to some part of the thoracic cage. The thorax is capable of responding mechanically to widely varying demands for oxygen.

The main source of energy for the production of speech sounds is a pulmonary expiration, although other mechanisms are possible. In order for speech to be produced, sufficient pressure has to be generated beneath the vocal folds. This subglottal pressure (the difference between the air pressures above and below the vocal folds) has to be sustained above a minimum level throughout an utterance. It sets the vocal folds into vibration if the sound is to be voiced or generates airflow for an unvoiced sound. The minimum subglottal pressure needed for speech production is 7<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm H<sub>2</sub>O and this increases when loud sounds are produced or when sounds are stressed.</div><div class="text" id="p0785">The need to generate sufficient sustained pressure means that speech ventilation is markedly non-rhythmical. At the onset of an utterance, inspiration is typically 1.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>litres, which is deeper than for normal quiet ventilation, ensuring that sufficient air is taken in to maintain adequate subglottal pressure for the duration of the utterance. Inspiration is also quicker, 0.5 seconds rather than 2–3 seconds. Expiration is much longer than normal, perhaps lasting up to 30 seconds, reflecting the fact that the vocal tract is more constricted at the larynx to ensure that pauses for further inspirations are made at suitable points in an utterance. At the end of the first inspiration during running speech, lung volumes do not fully return to resting levels. Conversational speech normally takes place at a higher range of lung capacities than operate in normal quiet ventilation.</div><div class="text" id="p0790">The non-rhythmical pattern during speech requires greater inspiratory effort, and for most people it involves a greater use of the diaphragm, usually in combination with the abdominal muscles that are attached to the lower ribs and stabilize the costal attachments of the diaphragm to increase the effectiveness of its action. The main differences are seen in expiration. Speech takes place at higher lung volumes, which means that greater recoil forces are stored in the elastic tissues of the lungs and the ribcage. The generation of subglottal pressure is the product of these elastic recoil forces and the muscular forces generated by the expiratory muscles. At the onset of an utterance, unrestrained recoil forces would generate excessive subglottal pressures that would be wasteful of air, and hence energy, and would affect the loudness of speech. Conversely, towards the end of an utterance, as recoil forces decline, subglottal pressure would fall without additional muscular exertion. Therefore, early in an utterance, inspiratory muscles, particularly the external intercostals and parasternal parts of the internal intercostals, continue to contract, relaxing slowly to counteract the effects of excessive passive elastic recoil. As the recoil forces decline below the point where they can maintain the minimum subglottal pressure needed for phonation, expiratory muscles contract to maintain subglottal pressure as lung air volume nears its resting expiratory level. The main muscles involved are the costal parts of the internal intercostals and the subcostal and transversus thoracis muscles. Their actions are aided by contraction of the anterior abdominal muscles to compress the abdomen. Accessory muscles such as latissimus dorsi may also come into play, but normally these accessory muscles are only active at the end of a very long or loud utterance, or in patients whose ventilatory function is compromised.</div><div class="text" id="p0795">Though subglottal pressure tends to remain fairly constant during an utterance, it rises when sounds are stressed, and falls during the production of unvoiced sounds when the larynx is less constricted. At these times, compensatory mechanisms are required to ensure that pressure is maintained; the precise mechanisms have yet to be elucidated but the internal intercostal muscles have been implicated. The anterior abdominal muscles are also active in singing and shouting, and in attempts to speak without the pause necessary for inspiration. Contrary to popular belief, the diaphragm plays little part in the regulation of expiratory force. Unlike the intercostal muscles, the diaphragmatic musculature is sparsely supplied with muscle spindles, and therefore control of the diaphragm is poorly regulated; minute changes can be effected more successfully using the intercostal and anterior abdominal muscles.</div><div class="text" id="p0800">Though the expiratory airflow from the lungs is the source of energy for most speech sounds, other sources of airflow are also used. The larynx can be used to generate airflow. The sound /p/ is produced by closing the larynx and then raising it with the lips closed, using the larynx like a piston. Opening the lips then releases a puff of air. This is called an ejective and is an example of egressive glottalic airflow. Ingressive glottalic airflow is also possible, though less effective; examples are not found in English but do in some African and native American languages. A third kind of airflow is velaric, in which the back of the tongue is raised against a lowered soft palate and the vocal tract is closed anterior to that point, either at the lips or with the tongue against the hard palate. This produces a click and is rare. A non-linguistic example in English is the sound made in encouraging a horse. Ingressive pulmonary airflow, such as is found in a groan or a gasp, is theoretically possible, but none of the world’s languages employ this as a source of airflow.</div><div class="text" id="p0805">After removal of the larynx, e.g. following laryngeal cancer, patients can be taught to swallow air, store it in a segment of the oesophagus and then use it as the energy source to produce egressive oesophageal airflow (oesophageal speech). Speech in these circumstances tends to have a belching quality. Laryngectomy patients always produce phrases that are shorter than normal, and so prostheses incorporating valves and surgical shunts are often inserted to provide a larger egressive airstream by diverting air from the respiratory tract into the oesophagus.</div></section><section><a id="s0605"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0520">Phonation</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0810">The default position of the rima glottidis is open, to maintain patency of the airway during respiration. In quiet respiration, the anterior intermembranous part of the rima glottidis is triangular when viewed from above. Its apex is anterior and its base posterior, and it is represented by an imaginary line approximately 8<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm long connecting the anterior ends of the arytenoid vocal processes. The intercartilaginous part between the medial surfaces of the arytenoids is rectangular, as the two vocal processes lie parallel to each other. During forced respiration, the rima glottidis is widened and the vocal folds are fully abducted to increase the airway (see <a href="#f0045">Fig. 41.8</a>). The arytenoid cartilages rotate laterally, and this moves their vocal processes apart, and converts the rima glottidis into a diamond shape in which both intermembranous and intercartilaginous parts are triangular. The greatest width of the rima glottidis is at the point of the attachments of the vocal folds to the vocal processes.</div><div class="text" id="p0815">During speech, the true vocal folds vibrate to act as a source of sound for subsequent speech. There have been a number of theories to explain the mechanism that produces this vibration but these are now only of historic interest. The aerodynamic–myoelastic theory is generally accepted as the mechanism underlying vocal fold vibration, although it does not account for all aspects of phonation.</div><div class="text" id="p0820">At the onset of an utterance, during an expiration, the true vocal folds are adducted: the lateral cricoarytenoids and transverse interarytenoids bring together both the intermembranous and intercartilaginous parts of the rima glottidis, actions that either close the glottis completely or reduce the space between the vocal folds to a linear chink. The mucous membrane covering the interarytenoid muscles, the interarytenoid fold, intrudes into the larynx when these muscles adduct the arytenoids, and so aids closure of the intercartilaginous part of the rima glottidis. The vocal folds are also tensed, an essential prerequisite for vibration. These actions cause a build-up of subglottal pressure that continues until a point is reached when the muscular force of adduction is no longer sufficient to resist the rising pressure, and the membranous portions of the vocal folds are forced open a little, releasing air into the supralaryngeal vocal tract. The subglottal pressure falls when the subglottic and supraglottic cavities become continuous and the vocal folds begin to close. Two mechanisms bring about closure. If adductive tension is sustained, then the vocal folds will close. In addition, rapid closure is aided by a physical process, the Bernoulli effect. The forcing of air from a region of high to low pressure through a narrow space causes an increase in the kinetic energy of the molecules at the edge of the space. The effect of this is to lower pressure in the space between the folds at the level of the folds themselves, and this negative pressure simply sucks the folds together because they are mobile. This causes a rise once more in the subglottal pressure and the cycle is repeated. The effect is to cause the release of a series of puffs of air into the supralaryngeal vocal tract at a frequency of many times per second, which is perceived as a sound of a particular frequency (<span class="bold"><a href="#f0075">Figs 41.14</a>–<a href="#f0080">41.15</a></span>, <span class="bold">Video 41.1</span>).</div><div id="para9770"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0075"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000410/main.assets/on41-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0070"/><a id="fspara0070"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 41.14</span> A video montage of the normal phonatory cycle, obtained using a rigid 70° Hopkins rod endoscope with stroboscopic illumination. <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Professor Paul Carding.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div id="para9870"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0080"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000410/main.assets/on41-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0075"/><a id="fspara0075"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 41.15</span> The position of the vocal folds during a cycle of vocal fold vibration (phonatory cycle). <span class="bold">A</span>, Superior view. <span class="bold">B</span>, Coronal view.</figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="text" id="p0830">The source of energy for the vibration does not come from the larynx itself. The vocal folds do not behave like the prongs of a tuning fork; their predominant motion is in the horizontal plane at right-angles to the movement of the air column, and there is little vertical movement. <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="734" id="pagebreak_734"/><a id="pg734"/>The energy is derived from the motion of the air generated by the muscular and recoil forces in the thorax, and the larynx is simply chopping that column into a series of segments.</div><div class="text" id="p9830">The aerodynamic–myoelastic theory does not explain how vocal fold vibration is sustained; nor does it account for the very obvious muco-undulatory component of vocal fold vibration that is visible when the larynx is viewed stroboscopically. Without further input of energy, the vibration of the vocal folds as described above would not be sustained but would be damped and gradually diminish. For vibration to continue there has to be additional energy input. The analogy here is with a child on a swing. For the motion to continue, either the parent has to push the child at an appropriate point in the cycle, or the child has to sustain the motion for themselves by swinging their legs at the crucial point in the swing cycle. In the case of phonation, the source of this additional energy is unclear. It may come from the inertia of the air column itself, i.e. once the vocal folds close, the air column will continue moving upwards because inertia creates a negative pressure above the folds. Alternatively, the energy could come from the manner in which the folds open and close. As the subglottal pressure rises, the lower portion of the fold opens first and the upper edge of the fold is last to open, and when the subglottal pressure falls, the folds close from the bottom edge. It has been suggested that this non-uniform closure creates different shapes within the glottis that may result in differing negative pressures at different phases of the cycle. It also produces a vertical wave-like motion in the folds, termed the muco-undulatory component (or ‘mucosal wave’). The analogy here is with a flag blowing in the wind, and it reflects the differing stiffness of the various layers of the vocal folds described above. This vertical component will impart a negligible amount of energy to the air column, but it is likely to impart harmonics to the basic laryngeal vibration.</div><div class="text" id="p9835">The sound that results from the process of phonation has three characteristics: a frequency that is perceived as pitch, an intensity that is perceived as loudness, and a timbre perceived as voice quality.</div><div class="text" id="p0840">The fundamental frequency of the human voice is determined by the resting length of the vocal folds and varies with age and sex. The frequency range of human speech is from 60 to 500<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>Hz, with an average of approximately 120<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>Hz in males, 200<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>Hz in females and 270<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>Hz in children. The mechanism of frequency alteration is not entirely clear. An increase in subglottal pressure will cause the frequency of phonation to rise. During an utterance, however, subglottal pressure appears to remain fairly constant, which suggests that the mechanism of frequency alteration resides in intrinsic changes within the vocal folds. Variations in frequency (pitch changes) during an utterance are determined by the complex interrelationships between length, tension and thickness of the vocal folds; one of these variables cannot be altered without affecting the other two parameters to some extent. Gross changes to the vocal folds demonstrate the effects of these variables. Inflamed and swollen vocal folds are much thicker than normal and result in a hoarse voice. At puberty, growth of the thyroid cartilage in males lengthens the vocal folds and lowers the fundamental frequency, and the voice ‘breaks’ as a result. During panic, the vocal folds may be tensed, which means that the cry for help is a high-pitched squeak.</div><div class="text" id="p0845">Pitch is increased by lengthening the vocal folds, as may be confirmed during direct endoscopic examination of the larynx. At first sight this may seem counterintuitive but, as the vocal folds are lengthened, there will be a consequent thinning and stretching. Although an analogy is often drawn between the vocal folds and vibrating strings, a better analogy is that of a rubber band: if a rubber band is lengthened, the tension will increase but the thickness will decrease. The vocal folds may be lengthened by up to 50% of their resting length. It is likely that the initial pitch setting is achieved by action of the cricothyroids, and that fine adjustments can then be made using the vocalis muscles. Paralysis of both cricothyroids, which is usually associated with loss of the neurones that are distributed via the superior laryngeal nerve (as a result of damage to the vagal nuclei in brainstem stroke), results in permanent hoarseness and inability to vary the pitch of the voice. It is important to remember that, once the vocal folds are set in motion, they will deviate from their original setting as they vibrate. Auditory feedback of the sounds produced is used to make minute compensatory adjustments to length, tension and thickness in order to maintain a constant pitch.</div><div class="text" id="p0850">Any lengthening of the vocal folds tends to thin them. The thickness can be increased by the vocalis part of thyroarytenoid: as vocalis shortens, it will relax the vocal folds and at the same time increase their thickness. Changes in the tension of the vocal folds are produced by the same muscles that change their length, namely: cricothyroid, posterior cricoarytenoid and vocalis, probably acting isometrically.</div><div class="text" id="p0855">The mechanism by which loudness is increased is the subject of less debate. Loud sounds are produced by increasing subglottal pressure. This is achieved, in turn, by changing the opening quotient of the glottis (the ratio of the time spent in the open phase of the cycle to the total cycle time). In normal speech, this ratio is usually around 0.5, but in very loud speech it can fall to 0.3.</div><div class="text" id="p0860">Timbre or voice quality refers to the harsh or mellow quality of the voice. The quality of the voice that can be consciously altered is, to a certain extent, a function of the harmonic frequencies produced by the vocal folds. Alteration of the shape of the supraglottic vocal tract accentuates different harmonics, altering the quality of the voice. Changes in harmonic frequencies facilitate production of different vowels and allows for a ‘bright’ or ‘dark’ sound in the voice.</div><div class="text" id="p0865">Nearly all languages make the fundamental distinction between voiced and unvoiced sounds. Voicing has been described above. In unvoiced sounds, the vocal folds are not vibrating and will usually be opened under the action of posterior cricoarytenoid. The energy from the airstream is then used by other parts of the vocal tract to generate sound, normally by constricting or stopping the airflow. Phonation is not an all-or-nothing process, but is subject to considerable modification and adjustment. In modal voice, i.e. speaking using habitual pitch, forces acting on the vocal folds are moderate, pressures are sustained, and air is conserved. However, phonation can take place when the vocal folds are more open than usual, resulting in breathy phonation with more air escaping per phonatory cycle than usual. Some languages in South Asia exploit the difference between breathy and non-breathy sounds, whereas in spoken English, a breathy voice is simply recognized as a feature of some speakers. At the other end of the spectrum is vocal creak, where the vocal folds are more closed than normal. Different speakers will habitually employ different laryngeal settings that contribute to their particular voiced quality. In whispering, the intramembranous part of the rima glottidis is closed but the intercartilaginous part remains open, producing a characteristic Y-shaped rima glottidis and a greater loss of air at each phonatory cycle.</div><div class="text" id="p0870">With regards to speech, the main function of the larynx is to act as a sound source, but it can also function in speech as an airstream generator and as an articulator.</div></section><section><a id="s0610"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0525">Articulation</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0875">The sound produced by phonation is not a pure tone because several harmonics at multiples of the fundamental frequency are also generated. Harmonics give a note of a particular frequency its defining characteristics. An ‘A’ played on an oboe or violin is immediately recognizable as coming from one or other instrument because of the different harmonics generated by the design of the instrument. The harmonic spectra of individual voices differ and will also vary depending upon the mode of phonation adopted. In the human vocal tract, the fundamental frequency and its harmonics are transmitted to the column of air that extends from the vocal folds to the exterior, mainly through the mouth. Part of the airstream can also be diverted through the nasal cavities when the soft palate is depressed to allow air into the nasopharynx. The supralaryngeal vocal tract acts as a selective resonator in which length, shape and volume can be varied by the actions of the muscles of the pharynx, soft palate, fauces, tongue, cheeks and lips; the relative positions of the upper and lower teeth, which are determined by the degree of opening and protrusion or retraction of the mandible; and alterations in the tension of the walls of the column, especially in the pharynx. Thus, the fundamental frequency (pitch) and harmonics produced by the passage of air through the glottis are modified by changes in the supralaryngeal vocal tract.</div><div class="text" id="p0880">Harmonics may be amplified or dampened. The fundamental frequency and its associated harmonics may also be raised or lowered by appropriate elevation or depression of the hyoid bone and the larynx as a unit. This is achieved by the selective actions of the extrinsic laryngeal muscles that can shorten or lengthen the resonating column, and to some extent, also alter the geometry of the walls of the air passages. Analysis of the human voice shows that it has a very similar pattern of harmonics for all fundamental frequencies, determined by the vocal tract acting as a selective filter and resonator. This maintains a constant quality of voice without which intelligibility would be lost (recorded speech played back without its harmonics is completely unintelligible). Each human voice is unique and it has been suggested that the unique frequency spectrum of each individual voice could be used for personal identification.</div><div class="text" id="p0885">During articulation, the egressive airstream is given a rapidly changing specific quality by the articulatory organs, the lips, oral cavity, tongue, teeth, palate, pharynx and nasal cavity. The discipline of phonetics primarily deals with the way in which speech sounds are produced, and consequently with the analysis of the mode of production of speech sounds by the vocal apparatus. In order to analyse the way in which the articulators are used in different speech sounds, words are broken down into units called phonemes, which are defined as the minimal sequential contrastive units used in any language.</div><div class="text" id="p0890">The human vocal tract can produce many more phonemes than are employed in any one language. Not all languages have the same phonemes, and within the same language, the phonemes can vary in different parts of the same country and in other countries where that language is also spoken. Reproducing phonemes that are not used in native speech is difficult because such phonemes require unfamiliar positioning of the speech organs. A native speaker of any language can quickly recognize the origins of anyone attempting to use their language as a second language. The second-language speaker will usually speak it with an accent characteristic of their own first language because they are using the familiar configurations of their vocal tract for each phoneme instead of the correct positioning.</div></section><section><a id="s0615"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0530">Production of vowels</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0895">All vowel sounds require phonation by vibration of the vocal folds. Each vowel sound has its own characteristic higher harmonics (frequency spectrum) that exhibit peaks of energy at certain frequencies. These energy peaks are always higher multiples of the fundamental frequencies and are called formants. Formants are the result of the combined effects of phonation, selective resonance of the vocal tract, and the properties of the head as a radiator of sound. The sounds of the different vowels are determined by the shape and size of the mouth, and the positions of the tongue and lips are the most important variables. The tongue may be placed high or low (close and open vowels), or further forwards or back (front and back vowels), and the lips may be rounded or spread.</div></section><section><a id="s0620"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0535">Production of consonants</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0900">The production of consonants always involves some degree of constriction of the vocal tract. There are many more consonants than vowels, and, in general, consonants cannot be combined to produce syllables. The classification of consonants is complex and beyond the remit of this book; what follows is a summary (for fuller details, a textbook of phonetics should be consulted).</div><div class="text" id="p0905">Consonants may be classified on the basis of where the constriction happens, termed the place of articulation; the degree or extent of constriction, termed the manner of articulation; the shape of the constriction, termed the stricture; and whether or not there is vibration of the vocal folds, when consonants are described as voiced or unvoiced, respectively.</div><div class="text" id="p0910">Consonants may also be classified as labial, dental, alveolar, velar, uvular, pharyngeal or glottic, depending on whether the point of maximum constriction occurs at the level of the lips, teeth, bony ridge behind the teeth, palate, uvula, pharynx or glottis, respectively (<a href="#f0085"><span class="bold">Fig. 41.16</span></a>). Different parts of the tongue can be used in combination with the above places of articulation. Phoneticians divide the tongue into the tip, anterior edge, the front part of the dorsum, the centre and back parts of the remaining dorsum, and a most posterior part (the root). These divisions bear no obvious relationship to the anatomical landmarks on the tongue, but they are useful in describing the part of the dorsum of the tongue that contacts other areas of the mouth. Similarly, the manner of articulation can vary from a complete closure to a slight narrowing. An actual closure of the vocal tract is called a stop. A narrowing that is sufficient to produce turbulence of the air in the vocal tract, and which is perceived as a rustling sound, is termed a fricative. Approximants involve a degree of closure insufficient to produce turbulence but with closure greater than that for a vowel. Nasals involve a stoppage in the oral cavity with the soft palate lowered to allow airflow through the nose, and, unlike stops, they can be sustained. Stricture describes the shape of the constriction, e.g. a lateral consonant involves depression of the sides of the tongue, while a grooved consonant is produced by grooving the dorsum of the tongue. Consonants can be produced with the vocal folds vibrating, when they are termed voiced, or without vocal fold vibration, in which case they are termed unvoiced.</div><div id="para9970"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0085"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000410/main.assets/on41-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0080"/><a id="fspara0080"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 41.16</span> Sagittal view of the left side of the head, showing the supralaryngeal vocal tract, the articulators and places of articulation. The red broken line indicates the tongue position during retroflexion (10).</figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="text" id="p0915">The best way to illustrate these classificatory systems in operation is by contrasting the production of different consonant pairs in which only one or two parameters have been changed. The /p/ of peat, the /b/ of beat and the /m/ of meat are all bilabial stops, meaning that they are produced by bringing together the lips. The /b/ and the /m/ are voiced but the /p/ is not. The contrast between the /b/ and the /p/ is in the differing way in which the airstreams are produced. The /b/ is produced with a closure of the vocal folds producing sounds (hence it is a ‘voiced’ consonant) during pulmonary airflow, while the /p/ is produced with the glottis open – hence is unvoiced – and the glottis is then raised using the larynx as a piston to compress the air in the supralaryngeal vocal tract prior to the stop being released. The /m/ differs from the other two stops in being a nasal in which the soft palate is lowered to allow air to escape through the nasal cavity; unlike the other two stops, it can be sustained as in a sound of approval. Bilabial stops can be contrasted with the labiodental fricatives /f/ of feet and the /v/ of veal, both of which are produced by retracting the lower lip beneath the upper teeth. Neither involves a complete closure but both produce a significant constriction of the vocal tract with audible turbulence: the /f/ is unvoiced, while the /v/ is voiced. The sh sound (/∫/) in ship is also a fricative involving a grooving of the tongue and is associated with significant audible turbulence; it may be contrasted with the lateral approximant /l/ in law, in which the sides of the tongue are lowered. In this case, it is the nature of the stricture that is different and the degree of closure, e.g. in the case of the approximant /l/, closure is insufficient to produce turbulence. The sh sound in ship can be compared to the /k/ in keen, where the position of the tongue is different: in /k/ the tongue blade contacts the soft palate, while in sh the tongue tip or the blade contact the postalveolar region. The most dramatic example of the difference between voiced and unvoiced sounds may be appreciated if the /s/ sound in sip is compared with the /z/ in zip. If the larynx is loosely palpated while making a sustained unvoiced ‘ssssss’ sound, no vibration is felt, but if the ‘ssssss’ is commuted into a prolonged voiced ‘zzzzzz’, then vibration in the larynx should be readily detectable. The position of the tongue and other articulators is exactly the same for both /s/ and /z/; the difference between them is the presence or absence of phonation.</div></section></section></section><footer><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="735" id="pagebreak_735"/><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebib0010"/><h2 class="reftitle" id="s4010">References</h2><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebibsec0010"/><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib11"><!--<a hreef="#bib_11">11</a>. --><a id="ref0055"/><a href="#bib_11">Adewale</a> L. <cite>Anatomy and assessment of the pediatric airway</cite>. <cite><i>Paediatr Anaesth</i></cite>. 2009;19(Suppl 1):1–8.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib12"><!--<a hreef="#bib_12">12</a>. --><a id="ref0060"/><a href="#bib_12">Aronson</a> A.E, Bless D.M. <cite><i>Clinical Voice Disorders</i></cite>. 4th ed. New York: Thieme; 2009.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib13"><!--<a hreef="#bib_13">13</a>. --><a id="ceotherref0010"/><a id="cetextref0010"/><span class="italic">A comprehensive summary of the organic disorders of voice due to laryngeal structural changes and neurological disease, as well as psychogenic voice disorders</span>.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib14"><!--<a hreef="#bib_14">14</a>. --><a id="ref0065"/><a href="#bib_14">Atkinson</a> M, McHanwell S. <cite><i>Basic Medical Science for Speech and Language Therapy Students</i></cite>. London: Whurr; 2002.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib15"><!--<a hreef="#bib_15">15</a>. --><a id="ref0070"/><a href="#bib_15">Awd</a> Allah R.S, Dkhil M.A, Farhoud E. <cite>Fibroblasts in the human vocal fold mucosa: an ultrastructural study of different age groups</cite>. <cite><i>Singapore Med J</i></cite>. 2009;50:201–207.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib16"><!--<a hreef="#bib_16">16</a>. --><a id="ref0075"/><a href="#bib_16">Berkovitz</a> B.K.B, Moxham B.J, Hickey S. <cite>The anatomy of the larynx</cite>. In: Ferlito A, ed. <cite><i>Diseases of the Larynx</i></cite>. London: Chapman &amp; Hall; 2000:25–44.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib17"><!--<a hreef="#bib_17">17</a>. --><a id="ceotherref0015"/><a id="cetextref0015"/><span class="italic">A description of all aspects of laryngeal anatomy, together with a very useful bibliography</span>.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib18"><!--<a hreef="#bib_18">18</a>. --><a id="ref0080"/><a href="#bib_18">Blitzer</a> A, Brin M.F, Ramig L.O. <cite><i>Neurologic Disorders of the Larynx</i></cite>. 2nd ed. New York: Thieme; 2009.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib19"><!--<a hreef="#bib_19">19</a>. --><a id="ceotherref0020"/><a id="cetextref0020"/><span class="italic">A book dealing with the evaluation, diagnosis and management of sensory and motor disorders of the larynx.
