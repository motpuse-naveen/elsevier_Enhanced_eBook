Initial sections consider the cell biology and microstructure of musculoskeletal tissues, including cartilage, bone, muscle, tendon and ligament. (Smooth muscle is described separately in <a href="../B9780702077050000069/B9780702077050000069.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, with cardiac muscle.) Molecular mechanisms of muscle contraction are explained, as are typical tissue changes associated with age and degeneration. Joints of the musculoskeletal system are classified, and their mechanical properties and actions explained in general terms. Details of individual bones and joints are included in the initial topographical chapters of Sections 4–9. A final ʻBiomechanicsʼ section gives a basic non-mathematical grounding in the subject, before explaining how mechanical considerations define and shape the entire musculoskeletal system. It explains, for example, why bones must be stiff and tendons tough, and how the cells of each musculoskeletal tissue adapt their surrounding matrix to meet the prevailing mechanical demands.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">biomechanics; bone; cartilage; cell biology; joints; ligament; microstructure; muscle; tendon</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p8710">The musculoskeletal system comprises the specialized connective tissues of the articulated bony skeleton (including bone, cartilage and tendon) and the skeletal muscles that act across the articulations.

In the adult skeleton it persists at almost all joints between bones and in structures that must be deformable as well as strong, e.g. in the respiratory tract.</div><section><a id="s0015"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0025">Microstructure of cartilage</h3><div class="textfl" id="p6775">Cartilage is a pliant, load-bearing connective tissue, covered by a fibrous perichondrium except at its junctions with bones and over the articular surfaces of synovial joints. It has a capacity for rapid interstitial and appositional growth in young and growing tissues. Three types of cartilage (hyaline cartilage, white fibrocartilage and yellow elastic cartilage) can be distinguished on the basis of the composition and structure of their extracellular matrices, but many features of the cells and matrix are common to all three types, and these features will be considered first.</div><section><a id="s0020"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0030">Extracellular matrix</h4><div class="textfl" id="p8456">The matrix is mostly comprised of collagen (and, in some cases, elastic) fibres, embedded in a highly hydrated proteoglycan gel (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.1</span></a>). Large proteoglycan molecules have numerous side chains of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), carbohydrates with remarkable water-binding properties. A preponderance of fixed negative charges on the surface of GAGs strongly attract polarized water molecules, causing wet cartilage to swell until restricted by tension in the collagen network, or by external loading. In this way, cartilage develops a compressive turgor that enables it to distribute loading evenly on to subchondral bone, rather like a water bed. Effectively, water is held in place by proteoglycans, which are themselves held in place by the collagen network. Cartilage proteoglycans are similar to those found in general, i.e. non-specialized, connective tissue. The most common GAG side chains in cartilage are chondroitin sulphate and keratan sulphate. The most common proteoglycan molecule, aggrecan, forms huge molecular aggregates with other proteoglycans and with hyaluronan (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 5.1</a>). Other constituents of cartilage include dissolved salts, non-collagenous proteins and glycoproteins.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.1</span> The fine structural organization of hyaline cartilage matrix.

The collagen network varies in different types of cartilage and with age. Collagen type I forms large fibres with a wavy ‘crimped’ structure: it is common in most fibrous tissues, but in cartilage it occurs only in the outer layers of the perichondrium, and in white fibrocartilage. More typical of cartilage is collagen type II, which forms very thin fibrils dispersed between the proteoglycan molecules so that they do not clump together to form larger fibres. Collagen type II fibrils are often less than 50<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>nm in diameter and are too small to be seen by light microscopy.

The length of collagen fibres and fibrils in cartilage is unknown, but even relatively short fibrils can reinforce the matrix by interacting physically and chemically with each other, and with other matrix constituents including proteoglycans (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Hukins and Aspden 1985</a>), reflecting the fact that the word collagen means ‘glue-maker’. Collagen type II is found in hyaline cartilage, the notochord, the nucleus pulposus of an intervertebral disc, the vitreous body of the eye, and the primary corneal stroma.</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0035">Cartilage cells</h4><div class="textfl" id="p9765">The cells of cartilage are chondroblasts and chondrocytes. Chondroblasts are actively dividing cells, often flattened and irregular in shape, and are abundant in growing tissue where they synthesize the extracellular matrix (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.2</span></a>). Small projections arising from the cell membrane (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.3</span></a>) can form gap junctions with adjacent cells (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Bruehlmann et al 2002</a>), but these junctions may be lost when interstitial growth causes greater cell separation. As chondroblasts mature and lose the ability to divide, they develop into the larger but metabolically less active chondrocytes. These oval-shaped cells form sparse populations that maintain the extensive matrix of adult cartilage. The name ‘chondrocyte’ is commonly employed, as it is here, to denote all of the cartilage cells embedded in an extensive matrix. Chondrocytes are normally in close contact with their dense matrix (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 5.3</a>); however, artefacts of tissue processing can sometimes give the illusion of an empty space or ‘lacuna’ surrounding <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="86" id="pagebreak_86"/><a id="pg86"/>each cell or group of cells in histological sections.

The nucleus is round or oval, appears euchromatic and possesses one or more nucleoli. The cytoplasm is filled with rough endoplasmic reticulum, transport vesicles and Golgi complexes, and contains many mitochondria and frequent lysosomes, together with numerous glycogen granules, intermediate filaments (vimentin) and pigment granules. When these cells mature to the relatively inactive chondrocyte stage, the nucleus becomes heterochromatic, the nucleolus smaller and the protein synthetic machinery much reduced; the cells may also accumulate large lipid droplets.</div><div class="text" id="p8045">Collagen is synthesized within the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the same way as it is in fibroblasts. Polypeptide chains are assembled into triple helices, and some carbohydrate is added. After transport to the Golgi apparatus, where further glycosylation occurs, the resulting procollagen molecules are secreted into the extracellular space. Terminal registration peptides are cleaved from their ends, forming tropocollagen molecules, and the final assembly into collagen fibrils takes place. Core proteins of the proteoglycan complexes are also synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and addition of GAG chains begins; the process is completed in the Golgi complex. Hyaluronan, which lacks a protein core, is synthesized by enzymes on the surface of the chondrocyte; it is not modified post-synthetically, and is extruded directly into the matrix without passing through the endoplasmic reticulum.</div><div class="text" id="p8050">Matrix turnover is much slower in cartilage than in more metabolically active tissues. Collagen turnover is particularly slow, leaving it vulnerable to the slow process of non-enzymatic glycation, which makes the tissue yellow, stiff and vulnerable to injury (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">DeGroot et al 2004</a>). Proteoglycans are turned over faster than collagen, with an estimated turnover time of 5 years for adult humans.</div><div class="text" id="p9055">Cartilage is often described as avascular. Certainly, the ability of the matrix to deform under load makes it difficult for hollow blood vessels to persist in the tissue beyond early childhood, but a limited vascular supply is often found on the cartilage surface, from where it can revascularize the tissue following injury or degeneration (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_41">Lama et al 2018</a>). Metabolite transport to cartilage cells is mostly by the process of diffusion down a concentration gradient from the cartilage surface, although fluid ‘pumping’ as a result of changing mechanical loading can contribute under certain circumstances. Metabolite transport severely limits cell density and metabolic rate in adult tissue, and this in turn restricts cartilage thickness to a few millimetres (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib39" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_39">Junger et al 2009</a>). Cartilage cells situated further than this from a nutrient vessel do not survive, and their surrounding matrix typically becomes calcified. In the larger cartilages, and during the rapid growth of some fetal cartilages, vascular cartilage canals penetrate the tissue at intervals, providing an additional source of nutrients. In some cases these canals are temporary structures but others persist throughout life.</div></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0040">Hyaline cartilage</h4><div class="textfl" id="p8060">Hyaline (glassy) cartilage has a homogeneous, opalescent appearance, sometimes appearing bluish. It is firm and smooth to the touch and shows considerable deformability. The size, shape and arrangement of chondrocytes vary at different sites and with age. They are flat near the surface perichondrium, and rounded or angular deeper in the tissue (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.2A</span></a>). Groups of two or more cells frequently form a cell nest (isogenous cell group) surrounded by a basket of fine collagen fibrils (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0015">Fig. 5.2B</a>). Within such a ‘chondron’, daughter cells of a common chondroblast often meet at a straight line. The pericellular matrix closest to the cells is typically lacking in collagen fibrils, but rich in proteoglycans that can exhibit basophilic and metachromatic staining. More distant and older interterritorial matrix appears paler and is mostly collagen type II (75% of dry weight) and proteoglycans (22%).<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="87" id="pagebreak_87"/><a id="pg87"/></div><div class="text" id="p8065">After adolescence, hyaline cartilage may become calcified, either as part of the normal process of bone development, or as an age-related, degenerative change. In costal cartilage, the matrix tends to fibrous striation, especially in old age when cellularity diminishes. The xiphoid process and the cartilages of the nose, larynx and trachea (excepting the elastic cartilaginous epiglottis and corniculate cartilages) resemble costal cartilage in microstructure. Hyaline cartilage is the prototypical form, but it varies more with age and location than either elastic or fibrocartilage. Its regenerative capacity following injury is poor.</div><div class="text" id="p9070">Articular cartilage, which covers the articular surfaces of synovial joints, is a specialized hyaline cartilage that lacks a perichondrium (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.4</span></a>). The synovial membrane overlaps and then merges into its structure circumferentially (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0165">Fig. 5.32</a>).

Thickness does not increase in response to increased mechanical loading, at least in adults, although matrix composition and stiffness can adapt somewhat (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib781" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_781">Gahunia and Pritzker 2012</a>).

Microscopic undulations on the cartilage surface help to trap synovial fluid (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0305">Fig. 5.60</a>) and enable fluid-film lubrication to reduce friction and wear. Articular cartilage is generally too thin and stiff to be a good shock absorber, although shock absorption may be significant where there are multiple cartilage-covered surfaces, as in the carpus and tarsus.</div><div class="text" id="p9080">Adult articular cartilage shows a structural zonation defined by its network of fine collagen type II fibrils (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0030"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.5</span></a>). Embedded in the deep calcified zone, fibrils rise vertically through the radial zone towards the cartilage surface, where they appear to reorientate to run parallel to the surface in the tangential zone.

Their three-dimensional orientation can be appreciated by repeatedly piercing the cartilage surface with a needle; this creates a series of permanent elongated splits in the surface, which can be stained by Indian ink. The resulting split line pattern (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib50" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_50">Meachim el al 1974</a>) reveals the predominant directions of collagen fibrils in the tangential zone, which may be related to internal lines of tension generated during joint movement.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0030"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-05-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0030"/><a id="fspara0030"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.5</span> Articular cartilage is not homogeneous: the various zones are different in terms of cell size and shape, and the orientation of the collagen fibril network.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p7085">Each zone of articular cartilage (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0030">Fig. 5.5</a>) has a distinct cell morphology and matrix composition.

Deeper within the tangential zone, the collagen fibrils increase in diameter and density, and gradually merge with those of the transitional (or intermediate) zone. Here, the chondrocytes are large and rounded, and surrounded by collagen fibrils in a range of oblique orientations. Deeper still, in the radial zone, the cells are often disposed in vertical columns, interspersed with vertical collagen fibrils. The matrix in this zone contains collagen types IX and XI, as well as type II. An undulating band known as the tidemark indicates the start of the deepest zone, the zone of calcified cartilage, which has mechanical properties intermediate between cartilage and bone. This calcified zone is keyed into the subchondral bone by fine ridges and interdigitations, which serve to prevent shearing (gliding) movements between cartilage and bone. With age, articular cartilage thins by upward advancement of the tidemark, and gradual replacement of calcified cartilage by bone.</div><div class="text" id="p9090">Cells of articular cartilage are capable of cell division, but mitosis is rarely observed in adult tissue and cartilage damage is not repaired. Superficial cells are lost progressively from normal young joint surfaces, to be replaced by cells from deeper layers.

Regions of fibrocartilage that are loaded predominantly in compression appear more homogeneous, contain a high proportion of fine collagen type II fibrils in an abundant proteoglycan gel, and contain rounded, chondrocyte-like cells. Fibrocartilage could therefore be regarded as a mingling of two types of tissue rather than a separate type of cartilage. However, no other tissue combines high proportions of proteoglycans with collagen type I, suggesting that fibrocartilage should be regarded as a distinct class of connective tissue.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0035"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-06-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0035"/><a id="fspara0035"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.6</span> White fibrocartilage in a late human fetal intervertebral disc.

The deep layers, adjacent to hypochondral bone, resemble calcified regions of the radial zone of hyaline articular cartilage. The superficial zone contains dense parallel bundles of thick collagen fibres, interspersed with typical dense connective tissue fibroblasts and little ground substance. Fibre bundles in adjacent layers alternate in direction, as they do in the cornea. A transitional zone of irregular bundles of coarse collagen and active fibroblasts separates the superficial and deep layers. The fibroblasts are probably involved in elaboration of proteoglycans and collagen, and may also constitute a germinal zone for deeper cartilage.

Like hyaline cartilage, it contains typical chondrocytes, either singly or in small groups, surrounded by a matrix rich in type II collagen fibrils. However, the more distant interterritorial matrix is pervaded by very fine yellow elastic fibres (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0040"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.7</span></a>) containing the protein elastin, which show no periodic banding structure under the electron microscope (as collagen fibrils do). A structure is termed ‘elastic’ if it returns to its original shape when loaded and then unloaded; elastic fibres (and cartilage) have the special property of being able to do this even after being subjected to deformations greater than 15%, which would damage collagen fibres. This characteristic is termed elastic recoil. Most sites in which elastic cartilage occurs have vibrational functions, such as laryngeal sound-wave production, or the collection and transmission of sound waves in the ear. Elastic cartilage is resistant to degeneration, and its capacity for limited regeneration following traumatic injury can be appreciated from the distorted repair of a cauliflower ear, as seen in participants of some contact sports.</div><section><a id="sf0040"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0040"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-07-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0040"/><a id="fspara0040"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.7</span> Elastic cartilage, stained to demonstrate elastin fibres (blue–black).

Mesenchymal cells proliferate and become tightly packed; the shape of their condensation foreshadows that of the future cartilage.

Each cell differentiates into a chondroblast as it secretes a basophilic halo of matrix, composed of a delicate network of fine type II collagen fibrils, type IX collagen and proteoglycan core protein. At some sites, continued secretion of matrix separates the cells, producing typical hyaline cartilage. Elsewhere, many cells become fibroblasts; collagen synthesis predominates and chondroblastic activity appears only in isolated groups or rows of cells that become surrounded by dense bundles of collagen fibres to form white fibrocartilage. In yet other sites, the matrix of early cellular cartilage is permeated first by anastomosing oxytalan fibres, and later by elastin fibres. In all cases, developing cartilage is surrounded by condensed mesenchyme, which differentiates into a bilaminar perichondrium. The cells of the outer layer become fibroblasts and secrete a dense collagenous matrix lined externally by vascular mesenchyme. The cells of the inner layer contain differentiated, but mainly resting, chondroblasts or prechondroblasts.</div><div class="text" id="p5130">Cartilage grows by interstitial and appositional mechanisms. Interstitial growth is the result of continued mitosis of early chondroblasts throughout the tissue mass and is obvious only in young cartilage, where plasticity of the matrix permits continued expansion. When a chondroblast divides, its descendants temporarily occupy the same chondron. They are soon separated by a thin septum of secreted matrix, which thickens and further separates the daughter cells. Continuing division produces isogenous groups. Appositional growth is the result of continued proliferation of the cells that form the internal, chondrogenic layer of the perichondrium. Newly formed chondroblasts secrete matrix around themselves, creating superficial lacunae beneath the perichondrium. This continuing process adds additional surface, while the entrapped cells participate in interstitial growth. Apposition is thought to be most prevalent in mature cartilages, but interstitial growth must persist for long periods in growth-plate cartilage. Relatively little is known about the factors that determine the overall shape of cartilage structures.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0050"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0060">Bone</h2><div class="textfl" id="p5135">Bone is a strong and rigid connective tissue that has evolved to enable fast terrestrial locomotion. Its strength provides support and protection for the body, while its rigidity enables it to create precisely shaped articular surfaces that do not distort under load, and ensures that forceful muscle contractions result in rapid limb movements rather than bending of bones. Unlike cartilage, bone is a highly vascular tissue with a high cell density; high cellularity enables it to adapt to changing mechanical demands, and to regenerate following injury.</div><section><a id="s0055"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0065">Macroscopic anatomy of bone</h3><div class="textfl" id="p5140">Macroscopically, living bone is white.

Compact bone is usually limited to the outer shell or cortex of mature bones, where it is important in determining their strength and providing rigid articular surfaces. Cortical thickness and architecture vary between and within bones, and generally decrease with age in adults. Trabecular bone provides support to the cortex while minimizing weight. The presence of a large central medullary canal in long bones also helps to reduce their weight. Spaces within bones provide convenient and secure locations for the storage of haemopoietic tissues and fat. Bone forms a reservoir of metabolic calcium (99% of body calcium is in the bony skeleton) and of phosphate, which is under hormonal and cytokine control.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0045"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-08-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0045"/><a id="fspara0045"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.8</span> A vertical section 2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm below the anterosuperior border of the iliac crest (female, 42 years).

Generally, a thick cortex is required to provide strength in bending, e.g. in the mid-diaphysis of a long bone (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0105">Fig. 5.20</a>). Trabecular bone provides strength in compression and so is abundant in the epiphyses of long bones, and in the vertebral bodies of the spine. In flat bones such as the ribs, the interior is uniformly cancellous, and compact bone forms the surface. Internal cavities are usually filled with marrow, either red haemopoietic or yellow adipose, according to age and site. However, in some bones of the skull, notably the mastoid process of the temporal bone and the paranasal sinuses of the frontal, maxilla, sphenoid and ethmoid bones, many of the internal cavities are filled with air, i.e. they are variably pneumatized.</div><div class="text" id="p5150">Bones vary not only in their primary shape but also in lesser surface details (secondary markings) that appear mainly in postnatal life. Most bones display features such as elevations and depressions, smooth areas and rough ridges. Broad elongated depressions are called fossae (e.g. the glenoid fossa); lengthy depressions are grooves or sulci (e.g. the humeral bicipital sulcus); a notch is an incisura; and an actual gap is a hiatus. A large projection is termed a process or, if elongated and slender or pointed, a spine. A curved process is a hamulus or cornu (e.g. the pterygoid hamuli of the sphenoid bone and the cornua of the hyoid). A rounded projection is a tuberosity or tubercle, and occasionally a trochanter. Long elevations are crests, or lines if they are less developed; crests are wider and present boundary edges or lips. An epicondyle is a projection close to a condyle and is usually a site where the common tendon of a superficial muscle group or a collateral ligament of the adjacent joint is attached. The terms protuberance, prominence, eminence and torus are occasionally applied to specific bony projections. The expanded proximal end of a long bone is often termed the ‘head’ or caput (e.g. humerus, radius, femur). A hole in a bone is a foramen and becomes a canal when lengthy. A large hole may be called an aperture or, if covered largely by connective tissue, a fenestra. Clefts in or between bones are fissures. A lamina is a thin plate; larger laminae may be called squamae (e.g. the temporal squama). Large areas on many bones are featureless and as smooth as articular surfaces, from which they differ by being pierced by visible vascular foramina.</div><div class="text" id="p5155">Tendons are usually attached at roughened bone surfaces. Wherever any aggregation of collagen in a muscle reaches bone, surface irregularities correspond in form and extent to the pattern of tendinous fibres. Such markings are almost always elevated above the general surface, as if ossification advanced into the collagen bundles from periosteal bone. How such secondary markings are induced is uncertain but they may result from the continued incorporation of new collagen fibres into the bone, perhaps necessary for minor functional adjustment. There is evidence that their prominence may be related to the power of the muscles involved, and they increase with advancing years as if the pull of muscles and ligaments exercised a cumulative effect over a limited area. Surface markings delineate the shape of attached connective tissue structures, e.g. an obvious tendon, intramuscular tendon or septum, aponeurosis, or tendinous fibres mediating what is otherwise a direct muscular attachment. These markings may be facets, ridges, nodules, rough areas or complex mixtures; they afford accurate indications of the junctions of bone with muscles, tendons, ligaments or articular capsules.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="90" id="pagebreak_90"/><a id="pg90"/></div><div class="text" id="p5160">Muscle fibres do not attach directly to periosteum or bone. Force transmission is through the connective tissue that encapsulates (epimysium) and pervades (perimysium and endomysium) all muscles. These two forms of attachment of muscles, which are at the extremes of a range of admixtures, differ in the density of collagen fibres between muscle and bone. Where collagen is visibly concentrated, markings appear on the bone surface. In contrast, the multitude of microscopic connective tissue ties of direct attachment that occur over a larger area do not visibly mark the bone, and so it appears smooth to unaided vision and touch.</div><div class="text" id="p5165">Many bones articulate with their neighbours at synovial joints. Small articular surfaces are termed facets or foveae; larger, knuckle-shaped surfaces are condyles; a trochlea is grooved like a pulley. Articular surfaces are smooth and covered by articular cartilage, which means that they lack the vascular foramina typical of the surfaces of most other bones.</div></section><section><a id="s0060"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0070">Microstructure of bone</h3><div class="textfl" id="p6170">Bone contains a mineralized collagenous extracellular matrix surrounding a range of specialized cells including osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts.

A significant proportion (30–40%) of the remaining dry weight is made up of the organic component of the extracellular matrix. Approximately 30% of this organic matrix is collagen; the remainder includes various non-collagenous proteins, glycoproteins and carbohydrates. The proportions of these components vary with age, location and metabolic status.</div><div class="text" id="p0180">Most of the collagen in bone is an ordered branching network of type I fibres (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0055"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.10</span></a>). Although type I collagen fibres are found in most connective tissues, their molecular structure in bone is atypical: internal cross-linking between component fibrils is stronger and chemically more inert, and transverse spacings between collagen molecules within each fibril are larger, allowing more space for the deposition of minerals. A small amount of type V collagen is also present, probably to help regulate fibrillogenesis. Collagen fibres contribute greatly to the cohesive mechanical strength of bone, and also to its toughness (which is reflected in the energy required to break a bone).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0055"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-10-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0055"/><a id="fspara0055"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.10</span> A scanning electron micrograph of collagen fibres on the surface of human trabecular bone.

Newly secreted molecules of tropocollagen lose part of their non-helical terminal regions, thus allowing them to polymerize in the extracellular matrix to form fibrils, which then associate to form fibres. These structures are stabilized by various cross-links, which increase in number and strength as the tissue matures. In primary bone, collagen fibres form a complex interwoven meshwork that incorporates other organic molecules; this ‘osteoid’ material is then mineralized to form woven (non-lamellar) bone. In time, primary bone is almost entirely replaced by regular laminar arrays of nearly parallel collagen fibres, which form the basis of lamellar bone (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_21">Currey 2002</a>). Partially mineralized collagen networks can be seen within osteoid on the outer and internal surfaces of bone, and in the endosteal linings of vascular canals. Collagen fibres from the periosteum are incorporated in cortical bone (extrinsic fibres) and anchor this fibrocellular layer at its surface. Terminal collagen fibres of tendons and ligaments are incorporated deep into the matrix of cortical bone. They may be interrupted by new osteons during cortical drift (modelling) and turnover (remodelling), and remain as islands of interstitial lamellae or even trabeculae.</div><div class="text" id="p0190">Bone organic matrix includes small amounts of various macromolecules attached to collagen fibres and surrounding bone crystals. They are secreted by osteoblasts and young osteocytes, and include osteonectin, osteocalcin, the bone proteoglycans biglycan and decorin, the bone sialoproteins osteopontin and thrombospondin, many growth factors including transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), proteases and protease inhibitors, often in a latent form. The functions of some of these molecules are described with osteoblasts (see below).</div></section><section><a id="s0070"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0080">Bone minerals</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0195">Approximately 60–70% of bone dry weight is made up of inorganic mineral salts in the form of microcrystalline hydroxyapatite (Ca<sub>10</sub> (PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub> (OH)<sub>2</sub>). The microcrystals confer hardness and much of the rigidity of bone, and are the main reason why bone is easily seen on radiographs. (Bone must be 50% mineralized to be visible on radiographs produced with a standard X-ray unit.) Bone mineral also has an important carbonate content, and a lower Ca:P ratio than pure hydroxyapatite, together with a small amount of calcium phosphate.

Up to two-thirds of the mineral content of bone is thought to be located within collagen fibrils, where the crystals are packed closely together, with their long axes nearly parallel to the fibrils; crystal formation is probably initiated in the gaps between individual collagen molecules. Narrow spaces between the crystals contain water and organic macromolecules. The mineral substances of bone are mostly acid-soluble. If they are removed, using calcium chelators such as citrates or ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), the bone retains its shape but becomes highly flexible.</div><div class="text" id="p0200">The major ions in bone mineral include calcium, phosphate, hydroxyl and carbonate. Less numerous ions are citrate, magnesium, sodium, potassium, fluoride, chloride, iron, zinc, copper, aluminium, lead, strontium, silicon and boron, many of which are present only in trace quantities. Fluoride ions can substitute for hydroxyl ions, and carbonate can substitute for either hydroxyl or phosphate groups. ‘Group IIA cations’, such as radium, strontium and lead, all readily substitute for calcium and are therefore known as bone-seeking cations. Since they can be either radioactive or chemically toxic, their presence in bone, where they may be close to haemopoietic bone marrow, may cause illness and characteristic appearances on X-rays.</div><div class="text" id="p0205">Mineralization of newly synthesized osteoid is a gradual process that slows over time; it typically reaches 70–80% in 3 weeks (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_27">Fuchs et al 2008</a>: data for rabbits). Immature woven bone mineralizes faster and so may be distinguished from adjacent lamellar bone by its higher degree of mineralization. In cortical bone, lamellae mostly take the form of cylindrical osteons (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0085">Fig. 5.16</a>). These structures mineralize from inside to out, so that the concentration of mineral is highest in the older, more peripheral, lamellae. Although new osteons are less mineralized than old ones, they may show one or more highly mineralized ‘arrest lines’ within their walls. Mineral distribution is most uniform in established, highly mineralized osteons. Overall, mineralization increases with age, even though bone mass decreases.</div></section><section><a id="s0075"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0085">Osteoblasts</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0210">Osteoblasts are derived from osteoprogenitor (stem) cells of mesenchymal origin present in bone marrow and other connective tissues. They proliferate and differentiate into osteoblasts prior to bone formation, stimulated by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). A layer of osteoblasts covers the forming surfaces of growing or remodelling bone (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0060"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.11</span></a>). In relatively quiescent adult bone, they appear to be present mostly on endosteal rather than periosteal surfaces, but they also occur deep within compact bone wherever osteons are being remodelled.

They synthesize and secrete collagens and a number of glycoproteins. Osteocalcin is required for bone mineralization, binds hydroxyapatite and calcium, and is used as a marker of new bone formation. Osteonectin is a phosphorylated glycoprotein that binds strongly to hydroxyapatite and collagen; it may play a role in initiating crystallization and may be a cell adhesion factor. RANKL is the cell surface ligand for RANK (receptor for activation of nuclear factor kappa B), an osteoclast progenitor receptor (see below). Osteoprotegerin is a soluble, high-affinity decoy ligand for RANKL, which restricts osteoclast differentiation. Biglycan and decorin are bone proteoglycans that attract water; decorin also binds the growth factor TGF-β. The bone sialoproteins, osteopontin and thrombospondin, mediate osteoclast adhesion to bone surfaces by binding to osteoclast integrins. In addition, osteoblasts secrete latent proteases and growth factors including BMPs and TGF-β (which is also secreted by osteoclasts and which may be a coupling factor for stimulating new bone formation at resorption sites).</div><div class="text" id="p0225">Although extracellular fluid is generally supersaturated with respect to the basic calcium phosphates, mineralization does not occur in most tissues. In bone, osteoblasts secrete osteocalcin (which binds calcium at levels sufficient to concentrate the ion locally) and contain membrane-bound vesicles full of alkaline phosphatase (cleaves phosphate ions from various molecules to elevate concentrations locally) and pyrophosphatase (degrades inhibitory pyrophosphate in the extracellular fluid). The vesicles bud off from the osteoblast surface into newly formed osteoid, where they initiate hydroxyapatite crystal formation. Some alkaline phosphatase reaches the blood circulation, where it can be detected in conditions of rapid bone formation or turnover.</div><div class="text" id="p0230">Osteoblasts also play a key role in the hormonal regulation of bone resorption. They express receptors for parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (calcitriol) and other promoters of bone resorption. When activated, osteoblasts promote osteoclast differentiation via PTH-activated expression of cell surface RANKL, which binds to RANK on immature osteoclasts, establishes cell–cell contact and triggers contact-dependent osteoclast differentiation. In the presence of PTH, osteoblasts also downregulate secretion of osteoprotegerin, a soluble decoy ligand with higher affinity for RANKL. In conditions favouring bone deposition, secreted osteoprotegerin blocks RANKL binding to RANK, restricting the number of mature osteoclasts.</div><div class="text" id="p0235">Bone-lining cells are flattened epithelial-like cells that cover the free surfaces of adult bone not undergoing active deposition or resorption. Generally considered to be quiescent osteoblasts or osteoprogenitor cells, they line the periosteal surface and the vascular canals within osteons, and form the outer boundary of the marrow tissue on the endosteal surface of marrow cavities.</div></section><section><a id="s0080"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0090">Osteocytes</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0240">Osteocytes are the major cell type of mature bone and are distributed throughout its matrix, interconnected by numerous dendritic processes to form a complex cellular network (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0065"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.12</span></a>).

Their sites of entry and angulation are almost constant and characteristically directed away from the dominant growing epiphysis. Nutrient arteries do not branch in their canals but divide into ascending and descending branches in the medullary cavity; these approach the epiphyses, dividing repeatedly into smaller helical branches close to the endosteal surface. The endosteal vessels are vulnerable during surgical operations, such as intramedullary nailing, which involve passing metal implants into the medullary canal. Near the epiphyses, diaphysial vessels are joined by terminal branches of numerous metaphysial and epiphysial arteries (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0105">Fig. 5.20</a>). The former are direct branches of neighbouring systemic vessels; the latter come from peri-articular vascular arcades formed on non-articular bone surfaces. Numerous vascular foramina penetrate bones near their ends, often at fairly specific sites; some are occupied by arteries but most contain thin-walled veins. Within bone, the arteries are unusual in consisting of endothelium with only a thin layer of supportive connective tissue. The epiphysial and metaphysial arterial supply is richer than the diaphysial supply.</div><div class="text" id="p0350">Medullary arteries in the shaft give off centripetal branches, which feed a hexagonal mesh of medullary sinusoids that drain into a wide, thin-walled central venous sinus. They also possess cortical branches, which pass through endosteal canals to feed fenestrated capillaries in Haversian systems. The central sinus drains into veins that retrace the paths of nutrient arteries, sometimes piercing the shaft elsewhere as independent emissary veins. Cortical capillaries follow the pattern of Haversian canals, and are mainly longitudinal with oblique connections <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="95" id="pagebreak_95"/><a id="pg95"/>via Volkmann's canals (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0095">Fig. 5.18</a>). At bone surfaces, cortical capillaries make capillary and venous connections with periosteal plexuses (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0105">Fig. 5.20</a>) formed by arteries from neighbouring muscles that contribute vascular arcades with longitudinal links to the fibrous periosteum. A capillary network permeates the deeper, osteogenic periosteum from this external plexus. At muscular attachments, periosteal and muscular plexuses are confluent and the cortical capillaries then drain into interfascicular venules.</div><div class="text" id="p0355">In addition to the centrifugal supply of cortical bone, there is an appreciable centripetal arterial flow to outer cortical zones from periosteal vessels. The large nutrient arteries of epiphyses form many intraosseous anastomoses, their branches passing towards the articular surfaces within the trabecular spaces of the bone. Near the articular cartilages, these form serial anastomotic arcades (e.g. there are three or four in the femoral head), which give off end-arterial loops. The latter often pierce the thin hypochondral compact bone to enter, and sometimes traverse, the calcified zone of articular cartilage, before returning to the epiphysial venous sinusoids.</div><div class="text" id="p0360">In immature long bones, the supply is similar but the epiphysis is a discrete vascular zone. Epiphysial and metaphysial arteries enter on both sides of the growth cartilage and rarely, if ever, anastomose. Growth cartilages are probably supplied from both sources, and from an anastomotic collar in the adjoining periosteum. Occasionally, cartilage canals are incorporated into a growth plate. Metaphysial bone is nourished by terminal branches of metaphysial arteries and by primary nutrient arteries of the shaft, which form terminal blind-ended sprouts or sinusoidal loops in the zone of advancing ossification. Young periosteum is more vascular; its vessels communicate more freely with those of the shaft than their adult counterparts and give off more metaphysial branches.</div><div class="text" id="p0365">Large, irregular bones such as the scapula and innominate not only receive a periosteal supply but are also often supplied by large nutrient arteries that penetrate directly into their cancellous bone, the two systems anastomosing freely. Short bones receive numerous fine vessels that supply their compact and cancellous bone and medullary cavities from the periosteum. Arteries enter vertebrae close to the base of their transverse processes (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0110">Fig. 46.20</a>). Each vertebral medullary cavity drains to two large basivertebral veins, which converge to a foramen on the posterior surface of the vertebral body (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0120">Fig. 46.21</a>). Flatter cranial bones are supplied by numerous periosteal or mucoperiosteal vessels. Large, thin-walled veins run tortuously in cancellous bone. Lymphatic vessels accompany periosteal plexuses but have not been convincingly demonstrated in bone.

Most bones are formed by a process of endochondral ossification, in which preformed cartilage templates (models) define their initial shapes and positions, and the cartilage is replaced by bone in an ordered sequence.</div><section><a id="s0130"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0140">Intramembranous ossification</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0385">Intramembranous ossification is the direct formation of bone (membrane bone) within highly vascular sheets or ‘membranes’ of condensed primitive mesenchyme. At centres of ossification, mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into osteoprogenitor cells, which proliferate around the branches of a capillary network, forming incomplete layers of osteoblasts in contact with the primitive bone matrix. The cells are polarized, and secrete osteoid only from the surface that faces away from the blood vessels. The earliest crystals appear in association with extracellular matrix vesicles produced by the osteoblasts. Crystal formation subsequently extends into collagen fibrils in the surrounding matrix, producing an early labyrinth of woven bone, the primary spongiosa. As layers of calcifying matrix are added to the early trabeculae, osteoblasts become enclosed within primitive lacunae. These new osteocytes retain intercellular contact by means of their fine cytoplasmic processes (dendrites) and, as these elongate, matrix condenses around them to form canaliculi.</div><div class="text" id="p0390">As matrix secretion and calcification proceed, trabeculae thicken and vascular spaces become narrower. Where bone remains trabecular, the process slows and the spaces between trabeculae become occupied by haemopoietic tissue. Where compact bone is forming, trabeculae continue to thicken and vascular spaces continue to narrow. Meanwhile, the collagen fibres of the matrix, secreted on the walls of the narrowing spaces between trabeculae, become organized as parallel, longitudinal or spiral bundles, and the cells they enclose occupy concentric sequential rows. These irregular, interconnected masses of compact bone each have a central canal and are called primary osteons (primary Haversian systems). They are later eroded, together with the intervening woven bone, and replaced by generations of mature (secondary) osteons.</div><div class="text" id="p0395">While these changes are occurring, mesenchyme condenses on the outer surface to form a fibrovascular periosteum. Bone is laid down increasingly by new osteoblasts, which differentiate from osteoprogenitor cells in the deeper layers of the periosteum. Modelling of the growing bone is achieved by varying rates of resorption and deposition at different sites.</div></section><section><a id="s0135"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0145">Endochondral ossification</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0400">The hyaline cartilage model that forms during embryogenesis is a miniature template of the bone that will subsequently develop.

The intervening matrix is compressed into thin, often perforated, septa. The cells degenerate and may die, leaving enlarged and sometimes confluent lacunae (primary areolae) whose thin walls become calcified during the final stages (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0115"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.22</span></a>).

At the same time, cells in the deep layer of perichondrium around the centre of the cartilage model differentiate into osteoblasts and form a peripheral layer of bone. Initially, this periosteal collar, formed by intramembranous ossification within the perichondrium, is a thin-walled tube that encloses and supports the central shaft (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0110">Figs 5.21</a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0115">5.22</a>).

These are blind-ended capillary sprouts that are accompanied by osteoprogenitor cells and osteoclasts. The latter excavate newly formed bone to reach adjacent calcified cartilage, where they continue to erode the walls of primary chondrocyte lacunae (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0120"><span class="bold">Figs 5.23</span></a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0125"><span class="bold">5.24</span></a>). This process leads to their fusion into larger, irregular communicating spaces, secondary areolae, which fill with embryonic medullary tissue (vascular mesenchyme, osteoblasts and osteoclasts, haemopoietic and marrow stromal cells, etc.). Osteoblasts attach themselves to the delicate residual walls of calcified cartilage and lay down osteoid, which rapidly becomes confluent, forming a continuous lining of bone. Further layers of bone are added, enclosing young osteocytes in lacunae and narrowing the perivascular spaces.

These trabeculae soon become remodelled and replaced by more mature bone or by marrow. Meanwhile, new, adjacent, cartilaginous regions undergo similar changes. Since these are most advanced centrally, and the epiphyses remain cartilaginous, the intermediate zones exhibit a temporospatial sequence of changes when viewed in longitudinal section (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0130"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.25</span></a>).

The growth zone expands in all dimensions. Lateral growth of a developing long bone is caused by occasional transverse mitosis in its chondrocytes, and by appositional growth as a result of matrix deposition by cells from the perichondrial collar or ring at this level. The future growth plate therefore expands in concert with the shaft and adjacent future epiphysis. A zone of relatively quiescent chondrocytes (the resting zone) lies on the side of the plate closest to the epiphysis. An actively mitotic zone of cells faces towards the shaft of the bone; the more frequent divisions in the long axis of the bone soon create numerous longitudinal columns (palisades) of disc-shaped chondrocytes, each in a flattened lacuna (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0130">Fig. 5.25</a>). Proliferation and column formation occur in this zone of cartilage growth (the proliferative zone), and its continued longitudinal interstitial expansion provides the basic mode of elongation of a bone.</div><div class="text" id="p0425">The columns of cells show increasing maturity towards the centre of the shaft, as their chondrocytes increase in size and accumulate glycogen. In the hypertrophic zone, energy metabolism is depressed at the level of the mineralizing front (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0120">Fig. 5.23</a>). The lacunae are now separated by transverse and longitudinal walls, and the latter are impregnated with apatite crystals in what has become the zone of calcified cartilage (or ossification zone; see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0115">Fig. 5.22</a>). The calcified partitions enter the zone of bone formation and are invaded by vascular mesenchyme containing osteoblasts, osteoclasts, etc. The partitions, especially the transverse ones, are then partly eroded while osteoid deposition, bone formation and osteocyte enclosure occur on the surfaces of the longitudinal walls. Lysis of calcified partitions is mediated by osteoclast action, aided by cells associated with the terminal buds of vascular sinusoids that occupy, and come into close contact with, each incomplete columnar trabecular framework.</div><div class="text" id="p0430">Continuing cell division in the growth zone adds to the epiphysial ends of cell columns, and the bone grows in length as this sequence of changes proceeds away from the diaphysial centre. The bone also grows in diameter as further subperiosteal bone deposition occurs near the epiphyses, and its medullary cavity enlarges transversely and longitudinally. Internal erosion and remodelling of the newly formed bone tissue continues.</div><div class="text" id="p0435">Growth continues in this way for many months or years in different bones, but eventually one or more secondary centres of ossification <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="98" id="pagebreak_98"/><a id="pg98"/>usually appear in the cartilaginous extremities. Initially, these epiphysial centres (or the ends of bones that lack epiphyses) do not display cell columns. Instead, isogenous cell groups hypertrophy, with matrix calcification, and are then invaded by osteogenic vascular mesenchyme, sometimes from cartilage canals. Bone is formed on calcified cartilage, as described above. As an epiphysis enlarges, its cartilaginous periphery (perichondrium) also forms a zone of proliferation in which cell columns are organized radially; hypertrophy, calcification, erosion and ossification occur at increasing depths from the surface. The early osseous epiphysis is thus surrounded by a superficial growth cartilage, and the growth plate adjacent to the metaphysis soon becomes the most active region.</div><div class="text" id="p0440">As a bone reaches maturity, epiphysial and metaphysial ossification processes gradually encroach upon the cartilaginous growth plate from either side; when they meet, bony fusion of the epiphysis occurs and longitudinal growth of the bone ceases. The events that take place during fusion are broadly as follows. As growth ceases, the cartilaginous plate becomes quiescent and gradually thins; proliferation, palisading and hypertrophy of chondrocytes stop, and the cells form short, irregular, conical masses. Patchy calcification is accompanied by resorption of calcified cartilage and some of the adjacent metaphysial bone, forming resorption channels that are invaded by vascular mesenchyme.</div><div class="text" id="p0445">Some endothelial sprouts pierce the thin plate of cartilage, and the metaphysial and epiphysial vessels unite. Ossification around these vessels spreads into the intervening zones and results in fusion of epiphysis and metaphysis. This bone is visible in radiographs as a radiodense epiphysial line (a term that is also used to describe the level of the perichondrial collar or ring around the growth cartilage of immature bones, or the surface junction between epiphysis and metaphysis in a mature bone). In smaller epiphyses, which unite earlier, there is usually one initial eccentric area of fusion, and thinning of the residual cartilaginous plate. The original sites of fusion are subsequently resorbed and replaced by new bone. Medullary tissue extends into the whole cartilaginous plate until union is complete and no epiphysial ‘scar’ persists. In larger epiphyses, which unite later, similar processes also involve multiple perforations in growth plates, and islands of epiphysial bone often persist as epiphysial scars. Calcified cartilage coated by bone forms the epiphysial scar, and is also found below articular cartilage. It has been called metaplastic bone, a term also applied to sites of attachments of tendons, ligaments and other dense connective tissues to bone.</div><div class="text" id="p0450">The cartilaginous surfaces of epiphyses that form synovial joints remain unossified, but the typical sequence of cartilaginous zones persists in them throughout life. A similar developmental sequence occurs at synchondroses, except that the proliferative rates of chondrocytes and the replacement of cartilage by bone are similar, although not identical, on either side of the synchondrosis.</div></section><section><a id="s0140"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0150">Postnatal growth and maintenance of bone</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0455">Modelling, by which is meant changes in general shape, occurs in all growing bones. The process has been studied mainly in cranial and long bones with expanded extremities.</div><div class="text" id="p0460">During calvarial growth, a bone such as the parietal thickens and expands, but also decreases in curvature. Accretion continues at its edges by proliferation of osteoprogenitor cells at sutures; periosteal bone is mainly added externally and eroded internally, but not at uniform rates or at all times. The rate of formation increases with radial distance from the centre of ossification (in this case, the future parietal eminence). Bone formation may also occur endocranially as well as ectocranially, so changing the curvature of the bone. The relative positions of the original centres of ossification change in three dimensions as the skull bones thicken and grow at the sutures and as the calvaria (vault) of the skull expands to accommodate the growth of the brain. Development of the outer and inner cortical plates is accompanied by internal development of trabeculae and marrow spaces.</div><div class="text" id="p0465">Long bones increase in length mainly by endochondral ossification at the epiphysial growth plates. Simultaneous increase in width occurs by subperiosteal deposition and endosteal erosion. Growth at different locations can occur at different rates, or even be replaced by resorption, resulting in a change in the shape of a bone. This explains how, for example, the tibia changes its cross-sectional shape from tubular to triangular. Similarly, the waisted contours of metaphyses are preserved by differential rates of periosteal erosion and endosteal deposition, as metaphysial bone becomes diaphysial in position. The junction between a field of resorption and one of deposition on the surface of a growing bone is called a surface reversal line. The relative position of such a line may remain stable over long periods of growth and shape change.</div><div class="text" id="p0470">Lamellar bone forms and is remodelled at variable rates throughout adult life (see below).</div><div class="text" id="p0475">Normal development and maintenance of bone requires adequate intake and absorption of calcium, phosphorus and vitamins A, C and D, and a balance between growth hormone (GH, somatotropin), thyroid hormones, oestrogens and androgens. Other biological influences include prostaglandins and glucocorticoids. Vigorous mechanical loading is important for the maintenance of adequate bone mass. Prolonged deficiency in any of these factors can lead to loss of bone tissue (osteopaenia); if bone loss is severe (osteoporosis), it can lead to fracture and deformity.</div><div class="text" id="p0480">Vitamin D influences intestinal transport of calcium and phosphate, and therefore affects circulatory calcium levels. In adults, prolonged deficiency (with or without low intake) produces bones that contain regions of deformable, uncalcified osteoid (osteomalacia). During growth, <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="99" id="pagebreak_99"/><a id="pg99"/>vitamin D deficiency can lead to severe disturbance of growth cartilages and ossification, such as reductions of regular columnar organization in growth plates, and failure of cartilage calcification even though chondrocytes proliferate. Growth plates also become thicker and irregular, as exemplified in classic rickets or juvenile osteomalacia. In rickets, the uncalcified or poorly calcified cartilaginous trabeculae are only partially eroded; osteoblasts secrete layers of osteoid but these fail to ossify in the metaphysial region, and ultimately gravity deforms these softened bones.</div><div class="text" id="p0485">Vitamin C is essential for the adequate synthesis of collagen and matrix proteoglycans in connective tissues. When vitamin C is deficient, growth plates become thin, ossification almost stops, and metaphysial trabeculae and cortical bone are reduced in thickness, causing fragility and delayed healing of fractures.</div><div class="text" id="p0490">Vitamin A is necessary for normal growth and for a correct balance between deposition and removal of bone. Deficiency retards growth as a result of the failure of internal erosion and remodelling, particularly in the cranial base. Foramina are narrowed, sometimes causing pressure atrophy of the nerves that pass through them. The cranial cavity and spinal canal may fail to expand at the same rate as the developing central nervous system, impairing nervous function. Conversely, excess vitamin A stimulates vascular erosion of growth cartilages, which become thin or totally lost, and longitudinal growth ceases. Retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative, is involved in pattern formation in limb buds and in the differentiation of osteoblasts.</div><div class="text" id="p0495">Balanced endocrine functions are also essential to normal bone maturation, and disturbances in this balance may have profound effects. In addition to its role in calcium metabolism, excess parathyroid hormone (primary hyperparathyroidism) stimulates unchecked osteoclastic erosion of bone, particularly subperiosteally and later endosteally (osteitis fibrosa cystica). Growth hormone (GH) is required for normal interstitial proliferation in growth cartilages, ensuring normal increase in stature. Termination of normal growth is imperfectly understood, but may involve a fall in hormone production or in the sensitivity of chondroblasts to insulin-like growth factors regulated by GH. Reduction of GH production in the young leads to quiescence and thinning of growth plates and hence pituitary dwarfism. Conversely, continued hypersecretion in the immature leads to gigantism, and in the adult results in thickening of bones by subperiosteal deposition; the mandible, hands and feet are the most affected, a condition known as acromegaly.</div><div class="text" id="p0500">While continued longitudinal growth of bones depends on adequate levels of GH, effective remodelling to achieve a mature shape also requires the action of thyroid hormones. Moreover, growth and skeletal maturity are closely related to endocrine activities of the ovaries, testes and suprarenal cortices. High oestrogen levels increase deposition of endosteal and trabecular bone; conversely, osteoporosis in postmenopausal women reflects reduced ovarian function. In men, fluctuations in the rate of growth, and the timing of skeletal maturation, depend on circulating levels of suprarenal and testicular androgens. In hypogonadism, growth-plate fusion is delayed and the limbs therefore elongate excessively; conversely, in hypergonadism, premature fusion of the epiphyses results in diminished stature.</div></section><section><a id="s0145"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0155">Bone remodelling</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0505">Stiff materials (including bone) are vulnerable to the accumulation of microdamage during repeated loading. In metals this can result in crack propagation and ‘fatigue failure’. Bone reduces the risk of such failure by periodically renewing itself, one small region of tissue at a time. This process is referred to as ‘remodelling’ because the volume and orientation of newly replaced matrix are not necessarily the same as the old; instead, bone takes this opportunity to adapt its mass and architecture to prevailing mechanical demands. Remodelling affects the local balance between resorption and deposition of bone. Its primary purpose is to renew bone rather than increase its mass, and the process continues throughout life, replacing approximately 10% of bone each year in adults (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Brandi 2009</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0510">Internal remodelling continuously supplies young osteons with labile calcium reserves, and provides a malleable bony architecture that is responsive to changing patterns of stress. A bone-remodelling unit consists of an advancing cutting cone and a closing cone.

Osteoblasts follow the osteoclasts, filling in the space created with new osteoid, starting at the peripheral surface or walls of the tunnel. Successive layers of bone are deposited on the surface of the previous layer as cohorts of osteoblasts become embedded (as osteocytes) in the matrix they secrete, until the most central lamella is close to the blood vessel at the axis of the cylinder. The ‘closing cone’ (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0135">Fig. 5.26</a>) may contain 4000 osteoblasts per mm<sup>2</sup>.

A hypermineralized basophilic cement (or growth-reversal) line marks the edge of a new osteon, indicating the border between the resorptive activity of the cutting cone and the bony matrix not remodelled by this activity. Remnants of the circumferential lamellae of old osteons form interstitial lamellae between newer osteons (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0090">Fig. 5.17A</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0135"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-26-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0135"/><a id="fspara0135"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.26</span> Bone remodelling.

However, the pattern and extent of remodelling are largely dictated by the mechanical loading applied to the bone. Bone resorption occurs when muscle or gravitational forces are reduced, as occurs in bed rest, or in zero gravity conditions in space (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib66" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_66">Shackelford et al 2004</a>). Reduced activity in old age is another major cause of bone loss. The rate of remodelling decreases with age, which means that numbers of osteons and osteon fragments can be used to estimate the age of skeletal material at death. Conversely, increased sporting or occupational loading of the skeleton can cause bone hypertrophy, as exemplified by the 35% increase in cortical thickness in the racket arm of elite tennis players (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_38">Jones et al 1977</a>). Bones appear to respond to the maximum deformation they experience (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0345">Fig. 5.68</a>), rather than to cumulative load.

Most bones ossify from several centres, one of which appears in the centre of the future bone in late embryonic or early fetal life (seventh week to fourth month). Ossification progresses from the centres towards the ends, which are still cartilaginous at birth (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0140"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.27</span></a>). These terminal regions ossify from separate centres, which are sometimes multiple, and which appear between birth and the late teens; they are therefore secondary to the earlier primary centre from which much of the bone ossifies.

As the epiphyses enlarge, almost all the cartilage is replaced by bone, except for a specialized layer of articular (hyaline) cartilage that persists at the joint surface, and a thicker zone between the diaphysis and epiphysis. Persistence of this epiphysial growth plate, or growth cartilage, allows increase in bone length until the usual dimensions are reached, by which time the epiphysial plate has ossified. The bone has then reached maturity. Coalescence of the epiphysis and diaphysis is fusion, the amalgamation of separate osseous units into one.</div><div class="text" id="p0540">Many long bones have epiphyses at both their proximal and their distal extremities, whereas metacarpals, metatarsals and phalanges have only one epiphysis. Typical ribs have epiphyses for the head and articular tubercle and another for the non-articular area. The costal cartilages represent the unossified hyaline cartilage of the developing rib and therefore do not display epiphyses. Epiphysial ossification is sometimes complex, e.g. the proximal end of the humerus is wholly cartilaginous at birth, subsequently developing three centres during childhood that coalesce into a single mass before they fuse with the diaphysis. Only one of these centres forms an articular surface, and the others form the greater and lesser tubercles, to which muscles are attached. Similar composite epiphyses occur at the distal end of the humerus and in the femur, ribs and vertebrae.</div><div class="text" id="p0545">Many cranial bones ossify from multiple centres. The sphenoid, temporal and occipital bones are almost certainly composites of multiple elements in their evolutionary history;: some show evidence of fusion between membrane and cartilage bones that unite during growth.</div><div class="text" id="p0550">If bone growth rate were uniform, ossification centres would appear in a strict descending order of bone size. However, disparate rates of ossification occur at different sites and do not appear to be related to bone size. The appearance of primary centres for bones of such different sizes as the phalanges and femora are separated by, at most, a week of embryonic life. Those for carpal and tarsal bones show some correlation between size and order of ossification, from largest (calcaneus in the fifth fetal month) to smallest (pisiform in the ninth to twelfth postnatal year). In individual bones, succession of centres is related to the volume of bone that each centre produces. The largest epiphyses, e.g. the adjacent ends of the femur and tibia, are the earliest to begin to ossify (immediately before or after birth) and are of forensic interest. At epiphysial plates, the rate of growth is initially equal at both ends of those bones that possess two epiphyses. However, experimental observations in other species have revealed that one epiphysis usually grows faster than the other after birth. Since the faster-growing end also usually fuses later with the diaphysis, its contribution to length is greater. Though faster rate has not been measured directly in human bones, later fusion has been documented radiologically. The more active end of a long limb bone is often termed the growing end but this is a misnomer.</div><div class="text" id="p0555">The rate of increase in stature, which is rapid in infancy and again at puberty, demonstrates that rates of growth at epiphyses vary. The spurt at puberty, or slightly before, decreases as epiphyses fuse in post-adolescent years.</div><div class="text" id="p0560">Growth cartilages do not grow uniformly at all points, which presumably accounts for changes such as the alteration in angle between the humeral shaft and its neck. The junctions between epiphysis and diaphysis at growth plates are not uniformly flat on either surface. Osseous surfaces usually become reciprocally curved by differential growth, and the epiphysis forms a shallow cup over the convex end of the shaft, with cartilage intervening – an arrangement that may resist shearing forces at this relatively weak region. Reciprocity of bone surfaces is augmented by small nodules and ridges, as can be seen when the surfaces are stripped of cartilage. These adaptations emphasize the formation of many immature bones from several elements held together by epiphysial cartilages. Most human bones exhibit these complex junctions, at which bone is bonded to bone through cartilage, throughout the active years of childhood and adolescence.</div><div class="text" id="p0565">Forces at growth cartilages are largely compressive but with an element of shear. Interference with epiphysial growth may occur as a result of trauma but more frequently follows disease; the resulting changes in trabecular patterns of bone are visible radiographically as dense transverse lines of arrested growth (Harris's growth lines). Several such lines may appear in the limb bones of children afflicted by successive illnesses.</div><div class="text" id="p0570">Variation in skeletal development occurs between individuals, sexes and possibly also races.

They are present in all postcranial bones that form from more than one centre of ossification. Since hyaline cartilage retains the capability to ossify with age, synchondroses tend to synostose when growth is complete. Primary cartilaginous joints are almost exclusively associated with growth plates (see above).</div></section><section><a id="s0190"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0200">Secondary cartilaginous joints</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0610">Secondary cartilaginous joints, or symphyses, are largely defined by the presence of an intervening pad or disc of fibrocartilage interposed between the articular (hyaline) cartilage that covers the ends of two articulating bones (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0150"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.29B</span></a>). Intervertebral discs are prime examples. The pad or disc varies from a few millimetres to over a centimetre in thickness, and the whole region is generally bound by strong, tightly adherent, dense connective tissues. Collagenous ligaments extend from the periostea of the articulating bones across the symphysis. The ligaments blend with the hyaline and fibrocartilaginous perichondria but do not form a complete capsule. They contain plexuses of afferent nerve terminals, which also penetrate the periphery of the fibrocartilage. The combined strength of the ligaments and fibrocartilage can exceed that of the associated bones. A symphysis is designed to withstand a range of stresses (compression, tension, shear, bending and torsion) but the range of movement is generally limited, both by the physical nature of the articulation and by adjacent bones. Tears are <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="102" id="pagebreak_102"/><a id="pg102"/>usually the result of sudden stresses that occur when the body is in an inappropriate posture.</div><div class="text" id="p0615">All symphyses occur in the midline (mandibular, manubriosternal, pubic and intervertebral) and all except the mandibular symphysis occur in the postcranial skeleton and resist synostosis.

Both types of joint must be strong, both are sites at which growth occurs, and both contribute either directly or indirectly to the total movement patterns of the parts involved. Movements that occur at a symphysis often depend on more than the mechanical properties of the fibrocartilaginous pad or disc, e.g. movements between vertebrae depend not only on the deformability of the intervertebral disc but also on the morphology of the apophysial joints and the properties of associated ligaments (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Adams et al 2013</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0625">The prominent role of synchondroses in skeletal growth is widely recognized, whereas growth of symphyses has received less attention.

Slight undulations in the surface trap synovial fluid so that fluid-film lubrication is possible under most circumstances; effectively, the bones ‘aqua-plane’ on each other (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0305">Fig. 5.60</a>).

This ‘boundary lubrication’ mechanism becomes important when the fluid film has been squeezed out, e.g. after sustained forceful loading of the joint, and loss of lubricin can lead to cartilage degeneration (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib74" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_74">Waller et al 2013</a>).

In small bones this attachment is usually near the periphery of the articular surfaces, but in long bones it varies considerably, and part or all of the attachment may be a significant distance from the articular surface. The joint capsule is perforated by vessels and nerves, and may contain apertures through which synovial membrane protrudes as bursae.</div><div class="text" id="p0665">A fibrous capsule usually exhibits local thickenings of parallel bundles of collagen fibres, called capsular (intrinsic) ligaments, and named by their attachments. Some capsules are reinforced or replaced by tendons of nearby muscles, or expansions from them. Accessory ligaments are distinct structures that may be located inside or outside the joint capsule. All ligaments, although stiff in tension, are pliant in bending. They can rebound elastically from being stretched by up to 10–15%, and are protected from injury by reflex contraction of appropriate muscles. They do little to resist normal movements but become taut at the end of each normal range of movement.</div></section><section><a id="s0210"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0220">Synovial membrane</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0670">Synovial membrane lines the fibrous joint capsule and exposed osseous surfaces, intracapsular ligaments, bursae and tendon sheaths (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0165"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.32</span></a>).

Where a tendon is attached to bone inside a synovial joint, an extension of the synovial membrane usually accompanies it beyond the capsule. Some extracapsular tendons are separated from the capsule by a synovial bursa that is continuous with the interior of the joint.

Folds and fringes of membrane may also project into a joint cavity; some are sufficiently constant to be named, e.g. the alar folds and ligamentum mucosum of the knee. Synovial villi are more numerous near articular margins and on the surfaces of folds and fringes, and become prominent in some pathological states.</div><div class="text" id="p0685">Accumulations of adipose tissue (articular fat pads) occur within the synovial membrane in many joints. These pads, together with synovial folds and fringes, are deformable cushions that occupy potential spaces and irregularities in joints that are not wholly filled by synovial fluid. During movement they accommodate to the changing shape and volume of the irregularities, a function they share with intra-articular discs and menisci. They also increase the area of synovial membrane, and may help to spread synovial fluid over the articular surfaces.</div><div class="text" id="p0690">Synovial membrane consists of a highly cellular intimal layer resting on a fibrous and vascular subintimal layer (subsynovial tissue). The subintima is often composed of loose, irregular connective tissue, but also contains organized collagen and elastin fibres lying parallel to the membrane surface, interspersed with occasional fibroblasts, macrophages, mast cells and fat cells. The elastic component may prevent formation of redundant folds during joint movement. Subintimal adipose cells form compact lobules surrounded by highly vascular fibroelastic interlobular septa that provide firmness and compressive turgor.</div><div class="text" id="p0695">The intimal layer consists of pleomorphic synovial cells embedded in a granular, amorphous matrix.

They are not separated from the subintima by a basal lamina, and are distinguished from subintimal cells only because they associate to form a superficial layer. In many locations, but particularly over loose subintimal tissue, areas are commonly found that are free from synovial cells. The synovial cells over fibrous subintimal tissue may be flattened and closely packed, forming endothelium-like sheets. Human synovial cells are generally elliptical, with numerous cytoplasmic processes. Neighbouring cells are often separated by gaps, but their processes may interdigitate where they lie close together. There is considerable regional variation in cell morphology and numbers.</div><div class="text" id="p0700">There are at least two morphologically distinct populations of synovial cells or synoviocytes: type A macrophage-like synoviocytes (MLS) and type B fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">Iwanaga et al 2000</a>). The phenotype of type A synoviocytes is similar to that of other tissue resident macrophage populations: morphologically they are characterized by surface ruffles or lamellipodia, plasma membrane invaginations and associated pinocytotic vesicles, a prominent Golgi apparatus but little rough endoplasmic reticulum. They probably synthesize and release lytic enzymes and phagocytose joint debris from synovial fluid. Type B synoviocytes, which predominate, resemble fibroblasts and have abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum but fewer vacuoles and vesicles, and a less ruffled plasma membrane than type A synoviocytes. They probably synthesize some of the hyaluronan of synovial fluid, the boundary lubricant lubricin, and inhibitors of the degradative enzymes synthesized by type A cells, limiting their potential to damage joint tissues. Synoviocytes do not divide actively in normal synovial membranes, but may do so in response to trauma and haemarthrosis. Under such conditions, type B synoviocytes divide <span class="italic">in situ</span>, while the population of type A cells increases by immigration of bone marrow-derived precursors.

It also contains hyaluronan, which is thought to be a significant determinant of its viscoelastic and thixotropic (flow rate-dependent) properties. Approximately 2% of synovial fluid protein differs from plasma protein and is probably produced by type B synoviocytes. Approximately one-quarter of this appears to be a specialized lubricating glycoprotein, lubricin. Synovial fluid contains a few cells (approximately 60 per ml in resting human joints), including monocytes, lymphocytes, macrophages, synovial intimal cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes; higher counts are found in young individuals. The amorphous metachromatic particles and fragments of cells and fibrous tissue found in synovial fluid are presumed to be the by-products of wear and tear.</div></section><section><a id="s0220"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0230">Intra-articular menisci, discs and fat pads</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0715">An articular disc or meniscus can occur between articular surfaces where congruity (conformity of opposing articular surfaces) is low. The term meniscus should be reserved for incomplete discs, like those in the knee joint and, occasionally, in the acromioclavicular joint. Complete discs, such as those in the sternoclavicular and inferior radio-ulnar joints, extend across a synovial joint, and so divide it structurally into two synovial cavities; they often have small perforations. The disc in the temporomandibular joint may be complete or incomplete (<a href="../B9780702077050000380/B9780702077050000380.xhtml">Ch. 38</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0720">The main part of a disc is relatively acellular, but the surface may be covered by an incomplete stratum of flat cells, continuous at the periphery with adjacent synovial membrane. Discs are usually connected to their fibrous capsule by vascularized connective tissue, so that they become invaded by blood vessels and afferent and vasomotor postganglionic sympathetic nerves. The union between disc and capsule can be close and strong, as occurs in the knee and temporomandibular joints. Discs and menisci are composed of fibrocartilage containing crimped type I collagen fibres, and are not covered by synovial membrane.</div><div class="text" id="p0725">The functions of intra-articular fibrocartilages are uncertain. Evidence from structural or phylogenetic data, aided by mechanical analogies, suggests that their functions include the improvement of fit between articulating surfaces; deployment of weight over larger surface areas; shock absorption; facilitation of combined movements; limitation of translational (gliding) movements at joints such as the knee; protection of articular margins; facilitation of rolling movements; and spread of lubricant. The temporomandibular disc has attracted particular attention because of its exceptional, perhaps unique, design and biomechanical properties.</div><div class="text" id="p0730">The functions of labra and fat pads, two other quite common types of intra-articular structure, are also uncertain. A labrum is a fibrocartilaginous anular lip, usually triangular in cross-section, attached to an articular margin such as the glenoid fossa or acetabulum. It deepens the socket and increases the area of contact between articulating surfaces, and may act as a lubricant spreader. Unlike menisci, labra are not compressed between articular surfaces. Small fibrous labra have been described along the ventral or dorsal margins of the zygapophysial joints at lumbar levels, as have meniscus-shaped fibroadipose meniscoids at the superior or inferior poles of the same joints. Fat pads are soft and change shape to fill joint recesses that vary in dimension according to joint position.</div></section><section><a id="s0225"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0235">Vascular supply and lymphatic drainage</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0735">Numerous branches from peri-articular arterial plexuses pierce the fibrous capsules to form subsynovial vascular plexuses. Some synovial vessels end near articular margins in an anastomotic fringe, the circulus articularis vasculosus. A lymphatic plexus in the synovial subintima drains along blood vessels to the regional deep lymph nodes.</div><div class="text" id="p0740">Articular cartilage, intra-articular menisci and cartilaginous discs are all avascular, presumably because high mechanical pressures in these deformable tissues would collapse any blood vessels inside them. Laboratory experiments show that proteoglycans inhibit vascular growth, so the high concentration of proteoglycans in the cartilaginous tissues of joints may help to exclude blood vessels. Injury and disease can alter both the mechanical and chemical environment within cartilage, and may allow revascularization in peripheral and disrupted regions.

Although there is overlap between the territories of different nerves, each nerve innervates a specific part of the capsule. The region made taut by muscular contraction is usually innervated by nerves that supply the antagonists. For example, during <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="105" id="pagebreak_105"/><a id="pg105"/>abduction, stretching the portion of the capsule of the hip joint supplied by the obturator nerve elicits reflex contraction of the adductors that is usually sufficient to prevent damage.</div><div class="text" id="p0750">Myelinated axons in articular nerves innervate Ruffini endings, lamellated articular corpuscles, and structures resembling Golgi tendon organs. Ruffini endings respond to stretch and adapt slowly, whereas lamellated corpuscles respond to rapid movement and vibration, and adapt rapidly; both types of receptor register the speed and direction of movement. Golgi tendon organs, innervated by the largest myelinated axons (10–15<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm diameter), are slow to adapt; they mediate position sense and also are concerned in stereognosis, i.e. recognition of shape of held objects.

If independent movements can occur around two axes (e.g. flexion–extension and axial rotation in the knee), the joint is biaxial and has two degrees of freedom. Since there are three axes for independent rotation, joints may have up to three degrees of freedom. Even though a true ‘ball-and-socket’ joint can rotate about many chosen axes, for each position there is a maximum of three orthogonal planes, which means that it can have, as a maximum, three degrees of freedom.</div><div class="text" id="p0825">For a uniaxial hinge joint with a single degree of freedom, a single unchanging axis of rotation would be predicted.

If the variation is minor, as in the elbow, it is often appropriate to describe a mean position for the axis. Motion in one direction is often linked to motion in another.

Although a widely used term, flexion is difficult to define. It often means approximation of two ventral surfaces around a transverse axis. However, the thumb is almost at right angles to the fingers: its ‘dorsal’ surface faces laterally so that flexion and extension at its joints occur around anteroposterior axes. At the shoulder, flexion is referred to an oblique axis through the centre of the humeral head in the plane of the scapular body, the arm moving anteromedially forwards and hence nearer to the ventral aspect of the trunk. At the hip, which has a transverse axis, flexion brings the morphologically dorsal (but topographically ventral) surface of the thigh to the ventral aspect of the trunk. Description of flexion at the ankle joint is complicated by the fact that the foot is set at a right-angle to the leg. Elevation of the foot diminishes this angle and is usually termed flexion, but because it involves the approximation of two dorsal surfaces it might equally be called extension. Since the terms ‘dorsal’ and ‘plantar’ are used to denote the superior and inferior surfaces, respectively, of the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="107" id="pagebreak_107"/><a id="pg107"/>foot, dorsiflexion and plantar flexion are the terms used to describe ankle movements.</div></section><section><a id="s0300"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0310">Abduction and adduction</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0845">Abduction and adduction occur around anteroposterior axes except at the first carpometacarpal and shoulder joints. The terms generally imply lateral or medial angulation, except in digits, where arbitrary planes are chosen (midlines of the middle digit of the hand and second digit of the foot), because these are least mobile in this respect. Abduction of the thumb occurs around a transverse axis and away from the palm. Similarly, abduction of the humerus on the scapula occurs in the scapular plane around an oblique axis at right-angles to it.</div></section><section><a id="s0305"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0315">Axial rotation</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0850">Axial rotation is a widely, but often imprecisely, used term. Its restricted sense denotes movement around some notional ‘longitudinal’ axis, which may even be in a separate bone, e.g. the dens of the second cervical vertebra, on which the atlas rotates. An axis may approximate to the centre of the shaft of a long bone, as in medial and lateral humeral rotation (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0175">Fig. 5.34</a>). Alternatively, the axis may be at an angle to the topographical axis of a bone, as in movement of the radius on the ulna in pronation and supination, where the axis joins the centre of the radial head to the base of the ulnar styloid process. In these examples, rotations can be independent adjunct motions, constituting a degree of freedom, or obligatory (coupled) rotations, which always accompany some other main movement as a consequence of articular geometry.</div></section><section><a id="s0310"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0320">Circumduction</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0855">Circumduction combines successive flexion, abduction, extension and adduction, and occurs when the distal end of a long bone circumscribes the base of a cone that has its apex at the joint in question.

This capacity is important in a variety of cellular functions, including locomotion, phagocytosis and mitosis. Slow movements can be effected by polymerization–depolymerization mechanisms involving actin and tubulin, but much faster and more forceful movements can be created by the so-called ‘motor proteins’, which use energy from the hydrolysis of adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP). Of these ATP-dependent systems, one of the most widespread is based on the interaction of the motor protein myosin with actin.</div><div class="text" id="p0870">In muscle cells the filaments of actin, myosin and other associated proteins are so abundant that they almost fill the interior of the cell. Moreover, they align predominantly in one direction, so that interactions at the molecular level are translated into forceful linear contraction of the whole cell. The ability of these specialized cells to change shape has thus become their most important property. Assemblies of contractile muscle cells, the muscles, are machines for converting chemical energy into mechanical work. Muscle forces move limbs and drive many of the functions of the human body, and muscle tissue constitutes 40–50% of body mass.</div><section><a id="s0325"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0335">Classification of muscle</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0875">Muscle cells (‘fibres’) are also known as myocytes (the prefixes myo- and sarco- are frequently used in naming structures associated with muscle). They differentiate along one of three main pathways to form skeletal, cardiac or smooth muscle. Both skeletal and cardiac muscle (<a href="../B9780702077050000069/B9780702077050000069.xhtml">Ch. 6</a>) may be called striated muscle, because their myosin and actin filaments are organized into regular, repeating structures (sarcomeres), which give the cells a finely cross-striated appearance when viewed microscopically. Cardiac muscle fibres are relatively short, with branched ends, and are joined to adjacent fibres at intercellular junctional complexes called intercalated discs, which skeletal muscle lacks. Smooth muscle cells (<a href="../B9780702077050000069/B9780702077050000069.xhtml">Ch. 6</a>) lack striations because their actin and myosin are not organized into sarcomeres.</div><div class="text" id="p0880">Other contractile cells, including myofibroblasts and myoepithelial cells, are different in character and developmental origin.

It consists of long, parallel multinucleate cells bundled together by collagenous sheaths. Its regular organization enables skeletal muscle to generate powerful contractions, with a power output of approximately 100watts per kilogram of tissue. However, the price paid for this organization is a limited contractile range: skeletal muscle can shorten by only 30%. If a larger range of movement is required, it must be achieved through the amplification provided by lever systems, as described in <a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0320">Fig. 5.63</a>. Skeletal muscle is innervated by somatic motor nerves and is sometimes referred to as voluntary muscle, because its contractions are often initiated under conscious control. However, this is a misleading term because skeletal muscle is involved in many movements, such as breathing, blinking and swallowing, which are often initiated at an unconscious level.</div><section><a id="s0335"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0345">Microstructure of skeletal muscle</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0890">Skeletal muscle fibres are enormous multinucleate cells (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0185"><span class="bold">Figs 5.36</span></a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0190"><span class="bold">5.37</span></a>) which develop by fusion of individual myoblasts (see below).

The arrays of thick and thin filaments form a partially overlapping structure in which electron density (as seen in the electron microscope) varies according to the amount of protein present.

A component of the Z-disc, α-actinin, is a rod-shaped molecule that anchors the plus-ends of actin filaments from adjacent sarcomeres to the Z-disc. Nebulin inserts into the Z-disc, associated with the thin filaments, and regulates the lengths of actin filaments. Desmin, an intermediate filament protein characteristic of muscle, encircles the myofibrils at the Z-disc and, with the linking molecule plectrin, forms a meshwork that connects myofibrils together within the muscle fibre and to the sarcolemma. Myomesin holds myosin filaments in their regular lattice arrangement in the region of the M-line. Dystrophin is confined to the periphery of the muscle fibre, close to the cytoplasmic face of the sarcolemma. It binds to actin intracellularly and is also associated with a large oligomeric complex of glycoproteins, the dystroglycan/sarcoglycan complex that spans the membrane and links specifically with merosin, the α<sub>2</sub>-laminin isoform of the muscle basal lamina.

The cisternae expand into larger sacs, junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum or terminal cisternae, where they come into close contact with T-tubules, forming structures called triads (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0200">Figs 5.39</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0215">5.42</a>). The membranes of the SR contain calcium–ATPase pumps that transport calcium ions into the terminal cisternae, where the ions are bound to calsequestrin, a protein with a high affinity for calcium, in dense storage granules. In this way, calcium can be accumulated and retained in the terminal cisternae at a much higher concentration than elsewhere in the sarcoplasm. Calcium-release channels (ryanodine receptors) are concentrated mainly in the terminal cisternae and form one-half of the junctional ‘feet’ or ‘pillars’ that bridge the SR and T-tubules at the triads. The other half of the junctional feet is the T-tubule receptor that constitutes the voltage sensor.</div></section><section><a id="s0355"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0365">Connective tissues of muscle</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0955">The endomysium is a delicate network of connective tissue that surrounds muscle fibres and forms their immediate external environment. It is the site of metabolic exchange between muscle and blood, and contains capillaries and bundles of small nerve fibres. Ion fluxes associated with the electrical excitation of muscle fibres take place across its proteoglycan matrix. The perimysium is a more substantial connective tissue structure that is continuous with the endomysium: it ensheathes groups of muscle fibres to form parallel bundles, or fasciculi. It carries larger blood vessels and nerves, and accommodates neuromuscular spindles. Perimysial septa are the inward extensions of a collagenous sheath, the epimysium, which forms part of the fascia that invests whole muscle groups.</div><div class="text" id="p0960">Epimysium consists mainly of type I collagen; perimysium contains type I and type III collagen; endomysium contains collagen types III and IV. Collagen type IV is associated particularly with the basal lamina that invests each muscle fibre. The epimysial, perimysial and endomysial sheaths coalesce where the muscles connect to adjacent structures at tendons, aponeuroses and fasciae (see below).<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="110" id="pagebreak_110"/><a id="pg110"/></div></section></section><section><a id="s0360"/><hgroup><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0370">Neurovascular supply of muscle</h4><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0375">Vascular supply and lymphatic drainage</h5></hgroup><section><a id="s0365"/><div class="textfl" id="p0965">In most muscles, the major source artery enters on the deep surface, frequently in close association with the principal vein and nerve, at the neurovascular hilum. The vessels subsequently course and branch within the connective tissue framework of the muscle. Smaller arteries and arterioles ramify in the perimysial septa and give off capillaries that run in the endomysium. The smaller vessels lie mainly parallel to the muscle fibres, but also branch and anastomose around the fibres, forming an elongated mesh.</div><div class="text" id="p0970">The gross vascular anatomy of muscles has been classified into five types according to the number and relative dominance of vascular pedicles that enter the muscle (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib49" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_49">Mathes and Nahai 1981</a>) (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0220"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.43</span></a>). This classification has important surgical relevance in determining which muscles will survive and therefore be useful for pedicled or free tissue transfer procedures in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Type I muscles possess a single vascular pedicle supplying a muscle belly, e.g. tensor fasciae latae (supplied by the ascending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery) and gastrocnemius (supplied by the sural artery). Type II muscles are served by a single dominant vascular pedicle and several minor pedicles, and can be supported on a minor pedicle as well as the dominant pedicle, e.g. gracilis (supplied by the medial circumflex femoral artery in the dominant pedicle). Type III muscles are supplied by two separate dominant pedicles, each from different source arteries, e.g. rectus abdominis (supplied by the superior and inferior epigastric arteries) <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="111" id="pagebreak_111"/><a id="pg111"/>and gluteus maximus (supplied by the superior and inferior gluteal arteries). Type IV muscles have multiple small pedicles that, in isolation, are not capable of supporting the whole muscle, e.g. sartorius and tibialis anterior; about 30% survive reduction on to a single vascular pedicle. Type V muscles have one dominant vascular pedicle and multiple secondary segmental pedicles, e.g. latissimus dorsi (supplied by the thoracodorsal artery as the primary pedicle, thoracolumbar perforators from the lower six intercostal arteries and the lumbar arteries as the segmental supply) and pectoralis major (supplied by the pectoral branch of the thoraco-acromial axis as the dominant pedicle, and anterior perforators from the internal thoracic vessels as the segmental supply).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0220"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-43-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0220"/><a id="fspara0220"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.43</span> Classification of muscles according to their blood supply. <br/><span class="figcredit">With permission from Cormack GC, Lamberty BGH 1994 The Arterial Anatomy of Skin Flaps, 2nd ed.

Muscle fibres involved in sustained activities, such as maintenance of posture, are served by a denser capillary network than fibres that are recruited only infrequently. It is common for muscles to receive their arterial supply via more than one route. The accessory arteries penetrate the muscle at places other than the hilum, and ramify in the same way as the principal artery, forming vascular territories. The boundaries of adjacent territories are spanned by anastomotic vessels, sometimes at constant calibre, but more commonly through reduced-calibre arteries or arterioles that are referred to as ‘choke vessels’. These arterial arcades link the territories into a continuous network.</div><div class="text" id="p0980">Veins branch in a similar way, forming venous territories that correspond closely to the arterial territories. In the zones where the arterial territories are linked by choke vessels, the venous territories are linked by anastomosing veins – in this case, without change of calibre. On either side of these venous bridges, the valves in the adjacent territories direct flow in opposite directions towards their respective pedicles, but the connecting veins themselves lack valves and therefore permit flow in either direction.</div><div class="text" id="p0985">Because of the potential for relative movement within muscle groups, vessels tend not to cross between muscles, but radiate to them from more stable sites or cross at points of fusion. Where a muscle underlies the skin, blood vessels bridge between the two. These may be primarily cutaneous vessels, which supply the skin directly but contribute small branches to the muscle as they pass through it, or they may be the terminal branches of intramuscular vessels, which leave the muscle to supplement the cutaneous blood supply. The latter are less frequent <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="112" id="pagebreak_112"/><a id="pg112"/>where the muscle is mobile under the deep fascia. Correspondence between the vascular territories in the skin and underlying tissues gave rise to the concept of angiosomes, which are composite blocks of tissue supplied by named distributing arteries and drained by their companion veins (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib70" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_70">Taylor and Pan (1998)</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib69" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_69">Taylor (2013)</a> for further analyses of muscle angiosomes).</div><div class="text" id="p0990">Pressure exerted on valved intramuscular veins during muscle contraction functions as a ‘muscle pump’ that promotes venous return to the heart. In some cases this role appears to be amplified by veins that pass through the muscle after originating elsewhere in superficial or deep tissues. The extent to which the muscle capillary bed is perfused can be varied in accordance with functional demand. Arteriovenous anastomoses, through which blood can be returned directly to the venous system without traversing the capillaries, provide an alternative, regulated pathway.</div><div class="text" id="p0995">The lymphatic drainage of muscles begins as lymphatic capillaries in epimysial and perimysial, but not endomysial, sheaths. These converge to form larger lymphatic vessels that accompany the veins and drain to the regional lymph nodes.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0370"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0380">Innervation</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1000">Every skeletal muscle is supplied by one or more nerves. Muscles in the limbs, face and neck are usually innervated by a single nerve, even though the axons it contains may be derived from neurones located in several spinal cord segments and their associated sensory and sympathetic ganglia. Muscles such as those of the abdominal wall, which originate from several embryonic segments, are supplied by more than one nerve. In most cases, the nerve travels with the principal blood vessels within a neurovascular bundle (see <a href="../B9780702077050000021/B9780702077050000021.xhtml#f0050">Fig. 2.9</a>), approaches the muscle near to its least mobile attachment, and enters the deep surface at a position that is more or less constant for each muscle.</div><div class="text" id="p1005">Nerves supplying muscle are frequently referred to as ‘motor nerves’ but they contain both motor and sensory components. The motor component is mainly composed of large myelinated α-efferent axons that supply the muscle fibres; small, thinly myelinated γ-efferents, or fusimotor fibres, that innervate the intrafusal muscle fibres of neuromuscular spindles (see <a href="../B9780702077050000033/B9780702077050000033.xhtml#pg65">p. 65</a>); and fine, unmyelinated postganglionic sympathetic fibres that innervate vascular smooth muscle. The sensory component consists of large, myelinated IA and smaller group II afferents from the neuromuscular spindles, large myelinated IB afferents from the Golgi tendon organs (see <a href="../B9780702077050000033/B9780702077050000033.xhtml#pg65">p. 65</a>), and fine myelinated and unmyelinated axons that convey pain and other sensations from free terminals in the connective tissue sheaths of the muscle.</div><div class="text" id="p1010">Within muscles, nerves travel through the epimysial and perimysial septa before entering the fine endomysial tissue around muscle fibres. Alpha motor axons branch repeatedly before they lose their myelinated sheaths to terminate in a narrow zone towards the centre of the muscle belly, known as the motor point. Clinically, this is the place on a muscle from which it is easiest to elicit a contraction with stimulating electrodes. Long muscles generally have two or more terminal (end-plate) bands because many muscle fibres do not run the full length of an anatomical muscle. The terminal branch of an α motor axon contacts a muscle fibre at a specialized synapse, the neuromuscular junction (see <a href="../B9780702077050000033/B9780702077050000033.xhtml#f0185">Fig. 3.36</a>). It gives off several short, tortuous branches that each end in an elliptical area, the motor end-plate. The underlying discoidal patch of sarcolemma, the sole plate or subneural apparatus, is thrown into deep synaptic folds. This discrete type of neuromuscular junction (<span class="italic">en plaque</span> ending) is found on muscle fibres that are capable of propagating action potentials. A different type of ending is found on slow tonic muscle fibres that do not have this capability, e.g. in the extrinsic ocular muscles, where slow tonic fibres form a minor component of the anatomical muscle. In this case, the propagation of excitation is taken over by the nerve terminals, which branch over an extended distance to form a number of small neuromuscular junctions (<span class="italic">en grappe</span> endings). Some muscle fibres of this type receive the terminal branches of more than one motor neurone. The terminals of the γ-efferents that innervate the intrafusal muscle fibres of the neuromuscular spindle also take a variety of different forms.</div><div class="text" id="p1015">The terminal branches of α motor axons are normally in a ‘one-to-one’ relationship with their muscle fibres: a muscle fibre receives only one branch, and any one branch innervates only one muscle fibre. When a motor neurone is excited, an action potential is propagated along the axon and all of its branches to all of the muscle fibres that it supplies. The motor neurone and the muscle fibres that it innervates can therefore be regarded as a functional unit: the ‘motor unit’. This arrangement accounts for the more or less simultaneous contraction of a number of fibres within the muscle. The size of a motor unit varies considerably. In muscles used for precision tasks, such as the extraocular and intrinsic laryngeal muscles, each motor neurone innervates perhaps ten muscle fibres, whereas in a large limb muscle, a motor neurone may innervate several hundred muscle fibres. Within a muscle, fibres belonging to one motor unit are distributed over a wide territory without regard to fascicular boundaries, and they intermingle with the fibres of other motor units. Motor units become larger in cases of nerve damage because denervation induces collateral or terminal sprouting of the remaining axons. Each new branch can potentially reinnervate a fibre, thus increasing the territory of its parent motor neurone (see <a href="../B9780702077050000872/B9780702077050000872.xhtml">Commentary 1.5</a><span class="icon1"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/icon03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="icon"/></span>).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0375"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0385">Muscle contraction</h3><div class="textfl" id="p1020">The arrival of an action potential at the motor end-plate of a neuromuscular junction causes acetylcholine (ACh) to be released from storage vesicles into the highly infolded 30–50<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>nm synaptic cleft that separates the nerve ending from the sarcolemma (see <a href="../B9780702077050000033/B9780702077050000033.xhtml#f0185">Fig. 3.36</a>). ACh is rapidly bound by receptor molecules located in the junctional folds, triggering an almost instantaneous increase in the permeability, and hence conductance, of the postsynaptic membrane. This generates a local depolarization (the end-plate potential), which initiates an action potential in the surrounding sarcolemma. The activity of the neurotransmitter is rapidly terminated by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is bound to the basal lamina in the sarcolemmal junctional folds. The sarcolemma is an excitable membrane, and action potentials generated at the neuromuscular junction propagate rapidly over the entire surface of the muscle fibre.</div><div class="text" id="p1025">Action potentials are conducted radially into the interior of the fibre via extensions of the sarcolemma, the T-tubules, ensuring that all parts of the muscle fibre are activated rapidly and almost synchronously. Excitation–contraction coupling is the process whereby an action potential triggers the release of calcium from the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. This activates a calcium-sensitive switch in the thin filaments and so initiates contraction. At the end of excitation, the T-tubular membrane repolarizes, calcium release ceases, calcium ions are actively transported back to the calsequestrin stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum by the calcium–ATPase pumps, and the muscle relaxes.</div><div class="text" id="p1030">The lengths of the thick and thin filaments do not change during muscle contraction. The sarcomere shortens by the sliding of thick and thin filaments past one another, drawing the Z-discs towards the middle of each sarcomere (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0205">Fig. 5.40</a>). As the overlap increases, the I- and H-bands narrow to near-extinction, while the width of the A-bands remains constant. Filament sliding depends on the making and breaking of bonds (cross-bridge cycling) between myosin head regions and actin filaments. Myosin heads ‘walk’ or ‘row’ along actin filaments using a series of short power strokes, each resulting in a relative movement of 5–10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>nm. Actin filament binding sites for myosin are revealed only by the presence of calcium, which is released into the sarcoplasm from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing a repositioning of the troponin–tropomyosin complex on actin: this is the calcium-sensitive switch. Myosin head binding and release are both energy-dependent and require ATP. In the absence of ATP (as occurs post mortem) the bound state is maintained, and is responsible for the muscle stiffness known as rigor mortis.</div><div class="text" id="p1035">The summation of myosin power strokes leads to an average sarcomere shortening of up to 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm; an anatomical muscle shortens by a centimetre or more, depending on the muscle, because each muscle has thousands of sarcomeres in series along its length.</div><section><a id="s0380"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0390">Slow-twitch versus fast-twitch fibres</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1040">The passage of a single action potential through a motor unit elicits a twitch contraction where peak force is reached within 25–100<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>ms, depending on the motor unit type involved. However, the motor neurone can deliver a second nervous impulse in less time than it takes for the muscle fibres to relax. When this happens, the muscle fibres contract again, building the tension to a higher level. Because of this mechanical summation, a sequence of impulses can evoke a larger force than a single impulse and, within certain limits, the higher the impulse <span class="italic">frequency</span>, the more force is produced (‘rate recruitment’). An alternative strategy is to recruit more motor units. In practice, the two mechanisms appear to operate in parallel, but their relative importance may depend on the size and/or function of the muscle; in large muscles with many motor units, motor unit recruitment is probably the more important mechanism.</div><div class="text" id="p1045">With the exception of rare tonic fibres, skeletal muscles are composed entirely of fibres of the twitch type. These fibres can all conduct action potentials but they differ in other respects. Some fibres obtain their energy very efficiently by aerobic oxidation of substrates, particularly of fats and fatty acids. They have large numbers of mitochondria; contain myoglobin, an oxygen-transport pigment related to haemoglobin, and <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="113" id="pagebreak_113"/><a id="pg113"/>are supported by a well-developed network of capillaries that maintains a steady nutrient supply of oxygen and substrates. Such fibres are well suited to functions such as postural maintenance, in which moderate forces need to be sustained for prolonged periods. At the other end of the spectrum, some fibres have few mitochondria, little myoglobin and a sparse capillary network, and store energy as cytoplasmic glycogen granules. Their immediate energy requirements are met largely through anaerobic glycolysis, a route that provides prompt access to energy but that is less sustainable than oxidative metabolism. They are capable of brief bursts of intense activity that must be separated by extended quiescent periods during which intracellular pH and phosphate concentrations are restored to normal values, and glycogen and other reserves are replenished.</div><div class="text" id="p1050">In some animals, different types of muscle fibre tend to be segregated into different muscles. This causes some muscles to have a conspicuously red appearance, reflecting their rich blood supply and high myoglobin content associated with a predominantly aerobic metabolism, whereas other muscles have a much paler appearance, reflecting a more anaerobic character. These variations in colour led to the early classification of muscle into red and white types; this classification has now been largely superseded by myosin-based typing and the presence of specific disease-related enzymes.</div><div class="text" id="p1055">In humans, all muscles are mixed, with fibres specialized for aerobic working conditions intermingling with fibres of a more anaerobic or intermediate metabolic character. Different types of fibre are not readily distinguished in routine histological preparations but are clear when specialized enzyme histochemical techniques are used. On the basis of metabolic differences, individual fibres can be classified as oxidative slow-twitch (red) fibres, or glycolytic fast-twitch (white) fibres. Muscles composed mainly of oxidative slow-twitch fibres correspond to the red muscles of classical descriptions. Muscles that are predominantly oxidative in their metabolism contract and relax more slowly than muscles relying on glycolytic metabolism. This difference in contractile speed is due in part to the activation mechanism (volume density of the sarcotubular system and proteins of the calcium ‘switch’ mechanism), and in part to molecular differences between the myosin heavy chains of these types of muscle. These differences affect the ATPase activity of the myosin head, which in turn alters the kinetics of its interaction with actin, and hence the rate of cross-bridge cycling. Differences between myosin isoforms can be detected histochemically, and ATPase histochemistry continues to play a significant role in diagnostic typing (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#t0010"><span class="bold">Table 5.1</span></a>). Two main categories have been described: type I fibres, which are slow-contracting, and type II, which are fast-contracting. Molecular analyses have revealed that type II fibres can be further subdivided according to their content of myosin heavy-chain isoforms into types IIA and IIX. Muscle fibres may contain only one (i.e. a pure fibre) or a combination (i.e. a hybrid fibre) of these isoforms; the five most prevalent muscle fibre types in humans are I, I/IIA, IIA, IIA/IIX, IIX. (For further reading, see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">Galpin et al (2012)</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib33" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_33">Holland and Ohlendieck (2013)</a>.)

Fibre type grouping, where fibres with similar metabolic and contractile properties aggregate, increases after nerve damage and with age. Grouping occurs as a result of reinnervation episodes, where denervated fibres are ‘taken over’ by a sprouting motor neurone and adopt its type properties. If the nerves to fast white and slow red muscles are cut and cross-anastomosed in experimental animals, so that each muscle is reinnervated by the other's nerve, the fast muscle becomes slower-contracting, and the slow muscle faster-contracting. There is evidence that such fibre type transformation may be a response to the patterns of impulse traffic in the nerves innervating the muscles (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib51" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_51">Minetto et al 2013</a>).

Chronic stimulation also triggers the synthesis of myosin heavy and light chain isoforms of the slow muscle type; the associated changes in cross-bridge kinetics result in a lower intrinsic speed of shortening. The muscle becomes more resistant to fatigue through changes in the metabolic pathways responsible for the generation of ATP and a reduced dependence on anaerobic glycolysis. There is a switch to oxidative pathways, particularly those involved in the breakdown of fat and fatty acids, and an associated increase in capillary density and in the fraction of the intracellular volume occupied by mitochondria. If stimulation is discontinued, the sequence of events is reversed and the muscle regains, over a period of weeks, all of its original characteristics. The reversibility of transformation is one of several lines of evidence that the changes take place within existing fibres, and not by a process of degeneration and regeneration.</div><div class="text" id="p1070">Many of the changes in the protein profile of a muscle that are induced by stimulation are now known to be the result of transcriptional regulation. For example, analysis of the messenger RNA species encoding myosin heavy chain isoforms shows that expression of the fast myosin heavy chain mRNA is downregulated within a few days of the onset of chronic stimulation, while the slow myosin heavy chain mRNA is upregulated. Although myosin isoform expression is responsive to the increase in use induced by chronic stimulation, it tends to be stable under physiological conditions unless these involve a sustained departure from normal postural or locomotor behaviour.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0390"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0400">Development and growth of skeletal muscle</h3><div class="textfl" id="p1075">Most information about the early development of the skeletal musculature in humans has been derived from other vertebrate species.

A small portion forming the extraocular muscles is derived from prechordal mesenchyme, which joins with the most rostral paraxial mesenchyme and which has been demonstrated to have a myogenic fate. Skeletal muscle precursor myoblasts delaminate from dermomyotomes, the lateral portion of the somites (see <a href="../B9780702077050000185/B9780702077050000185.xhtml#f0015">Fig. 18.2</a>).

The mononucleate myoblasts aggregate and fuse to form multinucleate cylindrical syncytia, or myotubes, in which the nuclei are aligned in a central chain (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0225"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.44</span></a>).

Mononucleate myoblasts fuse to form multinucleate primary myotubes, characterized initially by central nuclei. Subsequently, other myoblasts align along the primary myotubes and begin to fuse with one another, forming secondary myotubes. In large animals, such as humans, further generations of new muscle fibres are similarly formed. As the contractile apparatus is assembled, the nuclei move to the periphery, cross-striations become visible and primitive features of the neuromuscular junction emerge. Later, small adult-type myoblasts – satellite cells – can be seen lying between the basal lamina and the sarcolemma of the mature muscle fibre. These too appear to be derived from cells that originated in the somites during early development. <br/><span class="figcredit">Adapted with permission from Terry Partridge, Department of Genetic Medicine, Children's National Medical Center, Washington DC.</span></figcaption></figure></div></section><div class="text" id="p1090">Although synthesis of the contractile machinery is not dependent on fusion of myoblasts, it proceeds much more rapidly after fusion. Sarcomere formation begins at the Z-disc, which binds actin filaments constituting the I-band to form I–Z–I complexes. The myosin filaments assemble on the I–Z–I complexes to form A-bands. Nebulin and titin are among the first myofibrillar proteins to be incorporated into the sarcomere, and may well determine the length and position of the contractile filaments. Desmin intermediate filaments connect the Z-discs to the sarcolemma at an early stage, and these connections are retained.</div><div class="text" id="p1095">Myogenic cells continue to migrate and to divide, and from postfertilization weeks 7–9 there is extensive <span class="italic">de novo</span> myotube formation. Myoblasts aggregate near the midpoint of the primary myotubes and fuse with each other to form secondary myotubes, a process that may be related to early neural contact. Several of these smaller-diameter myotubes may be aligned in parallel with each of the primary myotubes. Each develops a separate basal lamina and makes independent contact with the tendon. Initially, the primary myotube provides a scaffold for the longitudinal growth of the secondary myotubes but eventually they separate. At the time of their formation, the secondary myotubes express an ‘embryonic’ isoform of the myosin heavy chains, whereas the primary myotubes express a ‘slow’ muscle isoform apparently identical to that found in adult slow muscle fibres. In both primary and secondary myotubes, sarcomere assembly begins at the periphery of the myotube and progresses inwards towards its centre. Myofibrils are added constantly and lengthen by adding sarcomeres to their ends. T-tubules are formed and grow initially in a longitudinal direction; since they contain specific proteins not found in plasma membranes, they are probably assembled via a different pathway from that which supports the growth of the sarcolemma. The sarcoplasmic reticulum wraps around the myofibrils at the level of the I-bands.</div><div class="text" id="p1100">By the end of the embryonic period, the primordia of most muscle groups are well defined, contractile proteins have been synthesized and the primitive beginnings of neuromuscular junctions can be observed, confined initially to the primary myotubes. Although some secondary fibre formation can take place in the absence of a nerve, most is initiated at sites of innervation of the primary myotubes. The pioneering axons branch and establish contact with the secondary myotubes. By postmenstrual week 11 these nerve–muscle contacts have become functional neuromuscular junctions and the muscle fibres contract in response to impulse activity in the motor nerves. Under this new influence, the secondary fibres express fetal (sometimes referred to as neonatal) isoforms of the myosin heavy chains. At this stage, several crucial events take place, which may be dependent on, or facilitated by, contractile activity. As the myofibrils encroach on the centre of the myotube, the nuclei move to the periphery and the characteristic morphology of the adult skeletal muscle myofibre is established. The myofibrils become aligned laterally, and A- and I-bands in register across the myotube produce cross-striations that are visible at the light microscopic level. T-tubules change from a longitudinal to a transverse orientation and adopt their adult positions; they may be guided in this process by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is more strongly bound to the myofibrils.</div><div class="text" id="p1105">The myotubes and myofibres are grouped into fascicles by growing connective tissue sheaths, and fascicles are assembled to build up entire muscles. As development proceeds, the increase in intramuscular volume is accommodated by remodelling of the connective tissue matrix.</div><div class="text" id="p1110">At about postmenstrual week 15, primary myotubes are still in the majority, but by postmenstrual week 20 the secondary myotubes predominate. During postmenstrual weeks 16–17, tertiary myotubes appear; they are small and adhere to the secondary myotubes, with which they share a basal lamina. They become independent by postmenstrual weeks 18–23, their central nuclei move to the periphery, and they contribute a further generation of myofibres. The secondary and tertiary myofibres are always smaller and more numerous than the primary myofibres. In some large muscles, higher-order generations of myotubes may be formed.</div><div class="text" id="p1115">Late in fetal life, a final population of myoblasts appears, and will become the satellite cells of adult muscle. These normally quiescent cells lie outside the sarcolemma beneath the basal lamina (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0225">Fig. 5.44</a>; <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0230"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.45</span></a>). M-cadherin, a cell adhesion protein of possible regulatory significance, occurs at the site of contact between a satellite cell and its muscle fibre. In a young individual, there is one satellite cell for every 5–10 muscle fibre nuclei. The latter are incapable of DNA synthesis and mitosis, and satellite cells are therefore important as the sole source of additional muscle fibre nuclei during postnatal growth of muscle (to maintain the ratio of cytoplasmic volume per nucleus as fibres increase in mass). After satellite cells divide, one of the daughter cells fuses with the growing fibre, the other remaining as a satellite cell capable of further rounds of division. In adult skeletal muscle, satellite cells provide a reservoir of cells that enable exercise-induced hypertrophy, and regeneration of muscle after damage (see below).<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="115" id="pagebreak_115"/><a id="pg115"/></div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0230"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-45-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0230"/><a id="fspara0230"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.45</span> An electron micrograph of a satellite cell.

The major isoform of sarcomeric actin in fetal skeletal muscle is cardiac α-actin; only later is this replaced by skeletal α-actin. The significance of these developmental sequences is not known.</div><div class="text" id="p1125">The pattern of expression is fibre-specific and changes over time. In primary myotubes, embryonic myosin is replaced by adult slow myosin from stage 23 onwards (postfertilization days 53-58). In secondary and higher-order myotubes, the embryonic myosin isoform is superseded first by fetal and then by adult fast myosin, and a proportion go on to express adult slow myosin. Other fibre-specific, tissue-specific and species-specific patterns of myosin expression have been described in mammalian limb muscles and jaw muscles.</div><div class="text" id="p1130">The origin of this diversity in the temporal patterns of expression of different fibres, even within the same muscle, is far from clear. It has been suggested that intrinsically different lineages of myoblast emerge at different stages of myogenesis or in response to different extracellular cues. If this is the case, their internal programmes may be retained or overridden when they fuse with other myoblasts or with fibres that have already formed. The fibres that emerge from this process go on to acquire a phenotype that will depend on the further influence of hormones and neural activity.</div><div class="text" id="p1135">In humans, unlike many smaller mammals, muscles are histologically mature at birth, but fibre type differentiation is far from complete. In postural muscles, the expression of type I (‘slow’) myosin increases significantly over the first few years of life. During this same period, the proportions of fibre types in other muscles become more divergent. The presence in adult muscles of a small proportion of fibres with an apparently transitional combination of protein isoforms reinforces the view that changes in fibre type continue to some extent in all muscles and throughout adult life. Fibre type transitions also occur in relation to damage or neuromuscular disease; under these conditions, the developmental sequence of myosins may be recapitulated in regenerating fibres.</div></section><section><a id="s0405"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0415">Growth and regulation of fibre length</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1140">Muscle fibres grow in length by addition of sarcomeres to the ends of myofibrils. In order for the mean sarcomere length, and hence filament overlap, to be optimized for maximum force, the number of sarcomeres must be regulated throughout life. This is achieved by the addition or removal of sarcomeres in response to any prolonged change of length. For example, if a limb is immobilized in a plaster cast, the fibres of muscles that have been fixed in a shortened position lose sarcomeres, while those that have been fixed in a lengthened position add sarcomeres; the reverse process occurs after the cast has been removed.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0410"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0420">Satellite cells and muscle repair</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1145">Until the mid-twentieth century, the mechanisms responsible for maintenance and repair of skeletal muscle were unclear. These issues were largely resolved by the discoveries that multinucleated muscle fibres were formed by the fusion of mononucleated precursors, myoblasts, and that a population of satellite cells, so called because of their position on the edge of the fibre, exist between the basal lamina of the mature muscle fibre and its sarcolemma, where they constitute 2–5% of the nuclei enclosed by the basal lamina.</div><div class="text" id="p1150">Studies in mouse models, where genetic analysis is possible, have shown that the functional properties of postnatal satellite cells depend on the expression of the <span class="italic">Pax7</span> gene, whereas the prenatal development of muscle is not similarly dependent.

Moreover, satellite cells are not a homogeneous population: no two differentiation markers concur completely.

Muscles with fibres (cells) that are largely parallel to the line of pull vary in form from flat, short and quadrilateral (e.g. thyrohyoid) to long and strap-like (e.g. sternohyoid, sartorius). In such muscles, individual fibres may run for the entire length of the muscle, or over shorter segments when there are transverse, tendinous intersections at intervals (e.g. rectus abdominis). In a fusiform muscle, the fibres may be close to parallel in the ‘belly’, but converge to a tendon at one or both ends. Where fibres are oblique to the line of pull, muscles may be triangular (e.g. temporalis, adductor longus) or pennate (feather-like) in construction.

Muscles may spiral around a bone (e.g. supinator, which winds obliquely around the proximal radial shaft), or contain two or more planes of fibres arranged in differing directions, a type of spiral sometimes referred to as cruciate (sternocleidomastoid, masseter and adductor magnus are all partially spiral and cruciate). Many muscles display more than one of these major types of arrangement, and show regional variations that correspond to contrasting, and in some cases independent, actions.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0240"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-47-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0240"/><a id="fspara0240"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.47</span> Morphological ‘types’ of muscle based on their general form and fascicular architecture.</figcaption></figure></div></section><section><a id="s0430"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0440">Direction of force</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1355">Although muscles differ in their internal architecture, the resultant force must be directed along the line of the tendon, so forces transverse to this direction must be in balance (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0240">Fig. 5.47</a>; <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0245"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.48</span></a>). In strap-like muscles, the transverse component is negligible. In fusiform, bipennate and multipennate muscles, symmetry in the arrangement of the fibres produces a balanced opposition between transverse components, whereas in asymmetric muscles (e.g. unipennate muscles), the fibres generate an unopposed lateral component of force that is balanced by intramuscular pressure.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0245"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-48-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0245"/><a id="fspara0245"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.48</span> The ‘detorsion’ or untwisting that results from the contraction of a spirally arranged muscle.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p1360">Muscles that incorporate a twist in their geometry unwind it as they contract, so that they tend not only to approximate their attachments but also to bring them into the same plane.

These demands are largely incompatible and require different muscle architecture.</div><div class="text" id="p1370">The force developed by an active muscle depends on the tension developed in each muscle fibre. If all of the muscle fibres are parallel (as in the strap-like muscle in <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0240">Fig. 5.47</a>), then the muscle force is equal to the sum of the tension in each fibre, and so will be proportional to the total cross-sectional area of those fibres. The range of contraction generated by an active muscle depends on the relative motion that can take place between the overlapping proteins in the sarcomere, and this sets a natural limit (approximately 30%) to the amount of fibre shortening that can take place. Hence, the movement of the tendinous insertion is proportional to the length of the muscle fibres.</div><div class="text" id="p1375">If these principles are applied to a long, strap-like muscle in which the fibres are predominantly parallel to the line of pull (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0240">Fig. 5.47</a>), it will be evident that the whole muscle will be able to contract by 30% of its length (the same as each muscle fibre). However, such a strap-like muscle contains relatively few muscle fibres, so the maximum tension it can develop will not be great. Compare this to the bipennate muscle in <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0250"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.49</span></a>, which contains perhaps three times as many muscle fibres, all set at an angle (typically 30°) to the axis of the tendon. Each short fibre will not be able to contract very far, and the contraction of the tendon will be even less, because the muscle fibres are pulling on it <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="117" id="pagebreak_117"/><a id="pg117"/>obliquely. So, the bipennate muscle has a poor contraction distance. However, the total force its fibres can generate will be approximately three times as great as the tension in the strap-like muscle. Even after this force is reduced to allow for its obliquity (in this case by cos 30°, which equals 0.87), the overall tension in the direction of the tendon will exceed that in the strap-like muscle by a factor of 2.6 (3×0.87). So, the bipennate muscle sacrifices contraction distance for greater maximum force. This effect would be much greater in the multipennate muscle shown in <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0240">Fig. 5.47</a>.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0250"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-49-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0250"/><a id="fspara0250"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.49</span> Force vectors in an idealized pennate muscle.

When considering human performance, it is possible for strength to increase without a concomitant increase in the true force-generating capacities of the muscles involved. Strength is usually measured under circumstances that require the participation of several muscles, and so depends on skilful coordination of these muscles as well as the forces they generate. This disparity can be marked during the early stages of physical training.</div><div class="text" id="p1385">Power is the rate at which a muscle can perform external work, and is equal to force multiplied by contraction velocity. Since force depends on the total cross-sectional area of muscle fibres, and velocity (the rate of muscle shortening) depends on muscle fibre length, powerful muscles tend to be long as well as fat. A prime example is the quadriceps, which is the prime mover when someone stands up from a <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="118" id="pagebreak_118"/><a id="pg118"/>seated position. A lack of power in this and other muscles is the critical factor that limits the ability of many elderly people to live independently (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib55" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_55">Reid and Fielding 2012</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0445"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0455">Actions of muscles</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1390">Historically, the actions of specific muscles were estimated from simple observation. Muscle attachments were identified by dissection, and their probable action deduced from the line of pull. With the use of localized electrical stimulation it became possible to study the actions of selected muscles systematically in the living subject. This approach was pioneered by Duchenne de Boulogne in the mid-nineteenth century. However, the study of isolated muscles cannot reveal the manner in which they interact during voluntary movements. Duchenne appreciated this, and supplemented electrical stimulation with observations of patients with partial paralysis to make more accurate deductions about the way in which muscles cooperate. Manual palpation can be used to detect muscle contraction, but only in superficial muscles under quasi-static conditions. Modern knowledge of muscle action has been acquired almost entirely by recording the electrical activity that accompanies mechanical contraction, a technique known as electromyography (EMG). This technique can be used to study activation of deep as well as superficial muscles, under static and dynamic conditions. Multiple channels of EMG can reveal coordination between different muscles that participate in a movement. These data can be further supplemented by monitoring joint angle and ground reaction force, and by recording the movement on camera or with a three-dimensional motion analysis system.</div><div class="text" id="p1395">Conventionally, the action of a muscle is defined as the movement that takes place when it contracts. However, this is an operational definition: equating ‘contraction’ with shortening, and ‘relaxation’ with lengthening is too simple in the context of whole muscles and real movements. Whether a muscle approximates its attachments on contraction depends on the degree to which it is activated, and the forces against which it has to act.</div><div class="text" id="p1400">Movements that involve shortening of an active muscle are termed concentric, e.g. contraction of biceps/brachialis while raising a weight and flexing the elbow. Movements in which the active muscle undergoes lengthening are termed eccentric, e.g. in lowering the weight previously mentioned, biceps/brachialis ‘pays out’ length as the elbow extends. Eccentric contractions stretch the collagenous tissue sheaths within muscle (see below), which increases the risk of tears in muscles such as the hamstrings, and of a more general delayed-onset muscle soreness (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib53" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_53">Proske and Morgan 2001</a>). Muscle contraction that does not involve change in muscle length is isometric.</div><div class="text" id="p1405">Natural movements are accomplished by groups of muscles. Each muscle may be classified, according to its role in the movement, as a prime mover, antagonist, fixator or synergist. It is usually possible to identify one or more muscles that are consistently active in initiating and maintaining a movement: these are its prime movers. Muscles that wholly oppose the movement, or initiate and maintain the opposite movement, are antagonists. For example, brachialis is the prime mover in elbow flexion, and triceps is the antagonist. To initiate a movement, a prime mover must overcome passive and active resistance and impart an angular acceleration to a limb segment until the required angular velocity is reached; it must then maintain a level of activity sufficient to complete the movement.</div><div class="text" id="p1410">When prime movers and antagonists contract together they behave as fixators, stabilizing the corresponding joint by increased transarticular compression, and creating an immobile base on which other prime movers may act. For example, flexors and extensors of the wrist co-contract to stabilize the wrist when an object is grasped tightly in the fingers.</div><div class="text" id="p1415">Acting across a uniaxial joint, a prime mover produces a simple movement. Acting at multiaxial joints, or across more than one joint, prime movers may produce more complex movements that contain elements that have to be eliminated by contraction of other muscles. The latter assist in accomplishing the movement and are considered to be synergists, although they may act as fixators, or even as partial antagonists of the prime mover. For example, flexion of the fingers at the interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints is brought about primarily by the long flexors, superficial and deep. However, these also cross intercarpal and radiocarpal joints, and if movement at these joints were unrestrained, finger flexion would be less efficient. Synergistic contraction of the carpal extensors eliminates this movement, and even produces some carpal extension, which increases the efficiency of the desired movement at the fingers.</div><div class="text" id="p1420">In the context of different movements, a given muscle may act as a prime mover, antagonist, fixator or synergist. Even the same movement may involve a muscle in different ways if it is assisted or opposed by gravity. For example, in thrusting out the hand, triceps is the prime mover responsible for extending the forearm at the elbow, and the flexor antagonists are largely inactive. However, when the hand lowers a heavy object, the extensor action of the triceps is replaced by gravity, and the movement is controlled by active lengthening (eccentric ‘contraction’) of the flexors. It is important to remember that all movements take place against the background of gravity and its influence must not be overlooked.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0450"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0460">Tendons and Ligaments</h2><div class="textfl" id="p1425">Forces developed by skeletal muscles are transferred to bone by tendons, aponeuroses and fasciae, whereas ligaments prevent excessive separation of adjacent bones.

They are composed of dense, regular connective tissue, with 60% of their dry weight comprising large crimped fibres of collagen type I (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0255"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.50</span></a>; see <a href="../B9780702077050000021/B9780702077050000021.xhtml#f0080">Fig. 2.15</a>). Other components of their matrix include collagen types II and V, elastin, glycoproteins and proteoglycans (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib75" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_75">Wang 2006</a>). Fascicles (bundles) of collagen fibres are orientated mainly parallel to the long axis of the tendon but are to some extent interwoven; they may be conspicuous enough to give tendons a longitudinally striated appearance to the unaided eye. Tendons generally have smooth surfaces, although large tendons may be ridged longitudinally by coarse fasciculi (as in the osseous aspect of the angulated tendon of obturator internus). Loose connective tissue between fascicles provides a conduit for small vessels and nerves; it condenses on the surface as a sheath or epitendineum, which may contain elastin and irregularly arranged collagen fibres. The loose attachments between this sheath and the surrounding tissue present little resistance to movements of the tendon. In situations where greater freedom of movement is required, a tendon is separated from adjacent structures by a synovial sheath.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0255"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-50-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0255"/><a id="fspara0255"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.50</span> The attachment of a tendon (pink) to skeletal muscle (orange).

Some of this extensibility is attributable to the reorientation of collagen type I fibres, some to the straightening of the crimped (wave-like) structure of these fibres, and some to sliding between adjacent collagen fibrils and fibres (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib64" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_64">Screen et al 2004</a>). Sliding is possible because discrete collagen fibres appear to reinforce connective tissue in the manner of a ‘chopped fibre-composite’ material such as fibre glass (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Hukins and Aspden 1985</a>), rather than by forming a fixed scaffold (which would make growth difficult). It takes a great deal of energy to stretch a long and strong tendon, and most of this ‘strain energy’ can be recovered when the tension is released. During locomotion, the rhythmic storing and releasing of strain energy in stretched tendons helps to smooth the movement, so that tendons (rather than cartilage) act as the body's <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="119" id="pagebreak_119"/><a id="pg119"/>natural shock absorbers. This energy storage and release also reduces the metabolic cost of locomotion. Tendons are sufficiently flexible that they can be diverted around osseous surfaces or deflected under retinacula to redirect the angle of pull.</div><div class="text" id="p1440">The vascular supply of tendon is sparse but not negligible. Small arterioles from adjacent muscle tissue pass longitudinally between the fascicles, branching and anastomosing freely, and are accompanied by venae comitantes and lymphatic vessels. This longitudinal plexus is augmented by small vessels from adjacent loose connective tissue or synovial sheaths. Blood vessels rarely pass between bone and tendon at osseous attachments, and the junctional surfaces are usually devoid of foramina. A notable exception is the calcaneal (Achilles) tendon, which does receive a blood supply across its osseotendinous junction. During postnatal development, tendons enlarge by interstitial growth, particularly at myotendinous junctions, where there are high concentrations of fibroblasts. Growth decreases along a tendon from the muscle to the osseous attachments. The thickness finally attained by a tendon depends on the size and strength of the associated muscle, but also appears to be influenced by additional factors such as the degree of pennation of the muscle. The cellularity, and hence the metabolic rate, of large adult tendons is very low, but increases during infection or injury. Repair involves an initial proliferation of fibroblasts followed by interstitial deposition of new collagen fibres (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib75" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Wang 2006</a>). Complete turnover (replacement) of the tissue, as seen in bone, does not occur in adult tendons, so healed tendons do not quite recover their original strength. Tendons can adapt their stiffness and strength to match prevailing mechanical demands, but the process is slow and may be incomplete (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib62" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_62">Rumian et al 2009</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1445">The nerve supply to tendons is largely sensory and there is no evidence of any capacity for vasomotor control. Golgi tendon organs, specialized endings that are sensitive to force, are found near myotendinous junctions; their large myelinated afferent axons run within branches of muscular nerves or in small rami of adjacent peripheral nerves. They play an important role in ‘tendon reflexes’, which serve to protect the musculoskeletal system from injury.</div></section><section><a id="s0465"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0475">Tendon attachments</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1450">Muscles connect to bones by means of tendons, aponeuroses and fasciae. The epimysial, perimysial and endomysial sheaths within muscle coalesce at these attachments, and interdigitate with adjacent collagenous structures to form strong connections in which force transmission is aided by shear stress transfer.</div><div class="text" id="p1455">At the myotendinous junction, muscle fibres separate into finger-like processes separated by insertions of tendinous collagen fibres. Although there are no desmosomal attachments at these junctions, other specializations assist in the transmission of force from the interior of the fibre to the extracellular matrix. Actin filaments from the adjacent sarcomeres, which would normally insert into a Z-disc at this point, instead penetrate a dense, subsarcolemmal filamentous matrix that provides attachment to the plasma membrane. This matrix is similar in character to the cytoplasmic face of an adherens junction. The structure as a whole is homologous to the intercalated discs of cardiac muscle. Integrins at the extracellular surface of the junctional sarcolemma provide contact with the basal lamina, which adheres closely to collagen and reticular fibres (type III collagen) of the adjacent tendon or other connective tissue structure.</div><div class="text" id="p1460">Tendinous attachments to bone (also known as entheses or osteotendinous junctions) have been broadly categorized as either fibrocartilaginous or fibrous (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Benjamin et al 2006</a>). In fibrocartilaginous entheses, four zones of tissue can be distinguished: pure dense fibrous connective tissue (continuous with and indistinguishable from the tendon), uncalcified fibrocartilage, calcified fibrocartilage, and bone (continuous with and indistinguishable from the rest of the bone). There are no sharp boundaries between zones, and the proportions of each component vary between entheses. A largely fibrocartilaginous enthesis is usually found where a tendon approaches the bone at a high angle, e.g. triceps brachii (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0260"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.51A</span>–<span class="bold">B</span>,<span class="bold">D</span></a>). At fibrous entheses, which are characteristic of the shafts of long bones, the tendon approaches the bone at an acute angle and merges with the periosteum before attaching to bone by dense fibrous connective tissue, e.g. pronator teres (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml#f0260"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.51C</span></a>).

Structurally, ligaments tend to have fibres orientated in a range of directions because they must resist the separation of bones in more than one direction, whereas collagen fibres in a tendon must simply align with tension in the adjacent muscle. More diverse mechanical roles of ligaments are also reflected in their composition. For example, the ligamentum flavum, which joins adjacent vertebrae in the spine, has a very high elastin content that enables it to be stretched more than 80% when the spine is flexed, and yet remain under tension in all postures. Maintaining tension is important because this ligament lies adjacent to the spinal cord, and could impinge on it if it became slack (and buckled) when the spine was moved into extension.</div></section></section></body></html>
