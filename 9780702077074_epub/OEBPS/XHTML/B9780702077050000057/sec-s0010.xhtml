Mechanical considerations explain why bones are stiff and tendons are tough, why the surfaces of some synovial joints are imperfectly matched, and why some tendons insert closer to joints than others. The emerging subject of ‘mechanobiology’ considers how cells adapt their matrix to prevailing mechanical demands and explains why some tissues are better at doing this than others.</div><section><a id="s0480"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0490">Mechanical concepts</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0495">Forces, moments and torques</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0485"/><div class="textfl" id="p1480">A force is an action that deforms an object, or that causes it to move, and can be termed compressive, tensile or shear, according to the manner in which it deforms that object (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0265"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.52</span></a>). A force F acting at the end of a lever of length L will generate a bending moment (F×L) acting about the pivot point of the lever.

If the forces all act in the same direction, they may be added. However, if they act in different directions, each force must be resolved into two imaginary components that act in two anatomically convenient directions at 90° to each other, using simple trigonometry.

The resulting graph of force against deformation usually resembles the one shown in <a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0275"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.54</span></a>. Stiffness is the ratio of force to deformation (typical units N/mm) and so is represented by the gradient of the graph. The initial region of low stiffness, or ‘toe region’, is followed by a stiffer region in which the graph is almost linear. In many biological structures, the ‘toe region’ can be explained by the straightening out of the zig-zag ‘crimped’ structure of collagen type I fibres, whereas the linear region represents direct stretching of the straightened collagen fibres (and some slipping between them). If the deformed structure springs back immediately to its original dimensions when the deforming force is removed, the deformation is termed ‘elastic’; a deformation that shows no sign of recovering is plastic; <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="121" id="pagebreak_121"/><a id="pg121"/>a deformation that recovers eventually, but gradually, is viscoelastic (see below). ‘Strength’ is the force at which an object becomes damaged, and is usually interpreted either as the force at which the gradient of the graph first reduces (the elastic limit) or as the force when the gradient falls to zero (the ultimate strength).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0275"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-54-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0275"/><a id="fspara0275"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.54</span> A typical force–deformation graph for a skeletal structure subjected to mechanical loading.

Strength is the force at which an object becomes damaged, and this is usually interpreted either as the force at which the gradient first reduces (the elastic limit) or as the force when the gradient falls to zero (the ultimate strength).</figcaption></figure></div></section><section><a id="s0495"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0505">Properties of materials</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1490">The properties of materials must be expressed in such a way that they are independent of the size and shape of the structure they constitute. A force divided by the area over which that force is applied gives a stress value (force per unit area) and the resulting deformation divided by the original length of the object gives a strain value (fractional or percentage deformation). Stress divided by strain is the size-independent material equivalent of the stiffness of an object, and is an important physical property termed the ‘modulus’ (sometimes ‘Young’s modulus’). There are different types of moduli but essentially they are measures of the stiffness, or resistance to deformation, of a material or tissue.</div></section><section><a id="s0500"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0510">Energy and shock absorption</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1495">Deforming an object may require a considerable expenditure of energy. Technically, the work done (i.e. energy expended) is proportional to the average force exerted, multiplied by the distance moved. This is mathematically equivalent to the area under the graph in <a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0280"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.55</span></a>, and is referred to as the strain energy, i.e. the energy expended in deforming the object. If the object has elastic properties, it will spring back to its original shape when the deforming force is removed, and all the strain energy is then released. (This release of strain energy explains why a stretched rope can recoil violently if it snaps.) Structures such as coiled springs, which can resist high forces and also deform extensively, are capable of storing large amounts of energy, and so can act as shock absorbers when they are continually compressed and stretched. Tendons act in a similar manner during locomotion: they store strain energy when they are stretched by muscle contraction, and release most of this energy when the muscles relax later in the gait cycle. Internal friction between matrix components means that a small fraction of the stored strain energy, the hysteresis energy, is dissipated as heat (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0280">Fig. 5.55</a>). This heat can cause the temperature to rise by several degrees centigrade in large tendons that are involved in vigorous repetitive activity. Any material or structure that is capable of absorbing large amounts of strain energy before failure is termed tough; otherwise it is brittle. From <a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0280">Fig. 5.55</a> it is apparent that tough materials must be both strong and extensible. In contrast, brittle materials such as glass and tooth enamel undergo minimal deformation and so absorb little strain energy, even though they are strong. The shock-absorbing characteristics of tendons are important during locomotion, making movements smoother and reducing metabolic cost (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Alexander 1988</a>).</div><section><a id="sf0280"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0280"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-55-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0280"/><a id="fspara0280"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.55</span> This force–deformation graph shows how an object deforms when a force is applied to it (upward arrow) and how it recovers its shape when the force is gradually released (downward arrow). The area under the loading curve represents the strain energy that has been expended in deforming the object. The area under the unloading curve represents the energy that is given up when the object is allowed to spring back to its original shape. The small area in between represents energy that cannot be recovered but is dissipated as heat. This is the hysteresis energy.</figcaption></figure></div></section></section><section><a id="s0505"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0515">Liquids</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1500">A liquid has negligible rigidity and so deforms readily to take the shape of its container. When compressed, it maintains practically the same volume, but it flows to equalize the intensity of loading within it. As a result, a static liquid under load exhibits a single internal stress (force per unit area) that does not vary with location or direction: this is ‘pressure’. Even delicate objects are not deformed when immersed in a high-pressure liquid if they themselves are filled with liquid, because the internal and external pressures on them are exactly equal; this explains why cells can survive high pressures in liquids without damage to their delicate plasma membrane. Of the musculoskeletal tissues, only the nucleus pulposus of intervertebral discs exhibits a true fluid pressure (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Adams et al 2013</a>). Some other tissues, including bone and cartilage, contain liquid that is able to move through pores in the solid matrix.</div></section><section><a id="s0510"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0520">Viscoelasticity</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1505">Materials are said to be viscoelastic if they behave partly like a thick (viscous) fluid and partly like an elastic solid. Viscoelastic deformations change with time, even when the deforming stress is constant, and complete recovery from such deformations also takes some time after the stress is removed (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0285"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.56</span></a>). In most biological materials, viscous behaviour occurs because applied loading causes fluid to flow from the most heavily loaded regions to the least loaded, by percolating through very small (nanometre-scale) pores in the matrix, a process that can take hours; for this reason, the term poroelastic is often preferred to viscoelastic when referring to tissues such as cartilage.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0285"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-56-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0285"/><a id="fspara0285"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.56</span> The deformation of viscoelastic materials varies with time. In this example, a load is applied at zero time, which causes an immediate elastic deformation, followed by a slowly increasing time-dependent deformation (creep). When the load is removed, some deformation is recovered immediately, but full recovery is achieved only slowly.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p1510">Creep and stress relaxation are two important manifestations of viscoelasticity. Creep may be described as continuing deformation under constant load (see <a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0285">Fig. 5.56</a>), whereas stress relaxation is a gradual decrease in force resisted by a viscoelastic material when it is initially deformed by a certain amount, and then held with the same constant deformation. Creep can reduce the thickness of loaded articular cartilage and intervertebral discs, typically by 20% in 5 minutes and 3 hours, respectively. Creep deformation is reversed over a comparable timescale when the compressive loading is reduced and water is reabsorbed. Bone creeps at a much slower rate, but in old osteoporotic vertebrae, creep probably contributes significantly to vertebral deformity (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_44">Luo et al 2012</a>).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0515"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0525">Material properties of skeletal tissues</h3><div class="textfl" id="p1515">The material properties of several skeletal tissues are compared in <a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#t0020"><span class="bold">Table 5.3</span></a>.</div><section><a id="s0520"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0530">Bone</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1520">Bone consists mainly of collagen type I and microcrystals of the mineral hydroxyapatite.

Rigidity (high stiffness or modulus) is the defining characteristic of bone; it enables the tissue to provide precisely shaped surfaces in synovial joints that will deform very little under load, and it also enables fast locomotion when muscles pull on bones. If bones were strong and tough but not rigid, rapid muscle contractions would cause them to bend alarmingly and would slow the angular movement of limbs.</div><div class="pageavoid"><p class="tnum">TABLE 5.3</p><div class="big_device"><table id="t0020" class="tbody"><caption class="ttitle"><a id="tspara0020"/>Tensile material properties of skeletal tissues<a href="#tbl5_3fnlowast" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="ctbl5_3fnlowast">∗</a></caption><thead><tr><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1"/><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">Cortical bone</th><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">Tendon (ligament)</th><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">Articular cartilage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope="row" class="tb">Strength (MPa)</th><td class="tb">130</td><td class="tb">50–110</td><td class="tb">5–20?</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="tb">Modulus (MPa)</th><td class="tb">17,000</td><td class="tb">500–1800 (150–800)</td><td class="tb">4–10</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="tb">Failure strain (%)</th><td class="tb">1–2.5</td><td class="tb">10–20</td><td class="tb">30–100</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="small_device"><p class="table_fig"><img src="B9780702077050000057_t0020_0.png" alt="image"/></p></div><footer><p class="tftnote" id="tbl5_3fnlowast" role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote"><sup><a href="#ctbl5_3fnlowast">∗</a></sup> <a id="fntpara0010"/>For comparison, alloy steel has a strength of 600<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>MPa and a modulus of 20,000<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>MPa.</p></footer></div></section><section><a id="s0525"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0535">Tendon, ligament and fascia</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1525">Tendons, ligaments and fascia consist primarily of densely packed collagen type I fibres, giving these tissues high tensile strength. The crimped nature of the collagen fibres allows them to be stretched by 10–15% before failure, and this combination of strength and extensibility enables tendons, ligaments and fascia to absorb more strain energy per unit weight than any other biological material. An important difference between tendons and ligaments is that ligaments often contain bundles of collagen fibres orientated in a range of directions, presumably because bones can be moved apart in a range of directions, whereas the fibres in a tendon are all aligned with the direction of muscle tension. Fascia usually contains collagen fibres aligned in adjacent sheets to resist forces in at least two different directions.</div></section><section><a id="s0530"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0540">Hyaline cartilage</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1530">Hyaline cartilage consists mainly of very fine collagen type II fibrils and large proteoglycan molecules, which have the property of attracting water and swelling. Collagen gives cartilage its tensile stiffness and strength, and the proteoglycans give the tissue a high water content that confers compressive ‘turgor’. During growth and healing, proteoglycans enable cartilage to swell and occupy space that later will be strengthened by other components of the matrix. Articular cartilage is a particular type of hyaline cartilage that covers the ends of articulating bones; its high water content enables it to distribute loading evenly on the underlying bone. Because cartilage is softer than bone, it deforms more when loaded, increasing the area of contact between articular surfaces and reducing contact stress (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0290"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.57</span></a>). Cartilage creep (see above) causes the area of contact to increase, and further reduces contact stress. Creep in articular cartilage also causes water to be exuded into the joint cavity, assisting in fluid-film lubrication (see below). Articular cartilage ‘wear’ (loss of material) during high and repetitive loading is minimized because the collagen type II fibrils in the superficial zone are aligned parallel to the surface, an arrangement that provides maximal resistance to surface splitting and the subsequent loss of tissue.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0290"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-57-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0290"/><a id="fspara0290"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.57</span> Articular cartilage in a synovial joint is not as stiff as the underlying bone, so the presence of cartilage in a loaded joint increases the area of contact (<span class="bold">B</span>) compared to a joint without cartilage (<span class="bold">A</span>).</figcaption></figure></div></section><section><a id="s0535"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0545">Fibrocartilage and elastic cartilage</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1535">Fibrocartilage and elastic cartilage combine the high proteoglycan and water content that characterizes cartilage with a high proportion of either collagen type I (fibrocartilage) or elastin (elastic cartilage).

The enlarged ends serve to reduce contact stress where long bones meet in synovial joints, and to increase the stability of such joints (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0295"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.58</span></a>). A different relationship between stability and mobility can exist in different anatomical planes, even for the same joint, e.g. the knee joint favours stability in the frontal plane and mobility in the sagittal plane. The hollow shaft of a long bone minimizes bone mass and so increases the speed of movement. However, it also maximizes the bone’s strength in bending for a given mass of material, because bending strength is increased by having as much bone as possible far from the axis of bending (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0300"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.59</span></a>). The precise cross-sectional shape of a long bone therefore gives a clear indication of the planes in which the shaft is most likely to be subjected to severe bending. Bony prominences or processes on long bones serve to increase the lever arm of the muscles attached to them: if a large prominence is close to the centre of rotation of a joint, then it can increase the lever arm by over 100%, and the maximum torque developed by the muscle about that centre of rotation would increase by the same amount.</div><section><a id="sf0295"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0295"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-58-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0295"/><a id="fspara0295"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.58</span> In synovial joints, the shapes of the opposing bone ends largely determine how much movement is possible, and the stability of the joint.

In a joint with a small range of movement, the intrinsic stability provided by its articular surfaces and ligaments may be more important than the extrinsic stability provided by surrounding muscles. Low-friction movement is facilitated by the smooth surfaces of articular cartilage being made slippery by the presence of the boundary lubricant lubricin, which is bound to the cartilaginous surfaces. This boundary lubrication reduces friction during slow movements, especially when forces are high. During rapid movements, microscopic undulations in the cartilage surface trap small quantities of synovial fluid between the articular surfaces, so that fluid-film lubrication (akin to aquaplaning) can also occur (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0305"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.60</span></a>), and friction and wear are greatly reduced.

The anulus resists radial expansion of the nucleus and can deform vertically to facilitate spinal bending in various planes. The relatively dense hyaline cartilage end-plate helps to maintain a fluid pressure in the nucleus by slowing down water loss into the vertebral body through perforations in the vertebral end-plate. Nevertheless, discs lose approximately 20% of their water gradually, in the course of each day. This net loss of water is regained at night when, in recumbency, the load on the spine is relieved. Diurnal variations in disc water content cause adults to be approximately 2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm taller in the early morning, and more flexible in the evening (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Adams et al 2013</a>).</div></section></section><section><a id="s0560"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0570">Muscles and lever systems</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0575">Collagenous architecture of muscle</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0565"/><div class="textfl" id="p1555">Muscles are supported by a hierarchy of collagenous sheaths (endomysium, perimysium and epimysium) that surround individual muscle fibres, fascicles and whole muscles, respectively. Muscles are also bound together into functional groups by collagenous fasciae. Together, these sheaths create a strong honeycomb structure that contributes to the muscle's resistance to tension. When muscle is stretched during eccentric (lengthening) contractions, high tensile forces in the collagenous structures add to the tension generated by muscle fibre contraction, leading to high and potentially damaging forces at the musculotendinous junction.</div></section><section><a id="s0570"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0580">Internal muscle forces</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1560">Generally speaking, muscle forces exert greater mechanical loading on the skeleton than does body weight. For example, during relaxed standing, 50% of the compressive force acting on the lumbar spine arises from the antagonistic activity of the muscles of the back and abdomen, and 50% comes from superincumbent body weight (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Adams et al 2013</a>). However, when bending the trunk to lift weights from the ground, more than 90% of the high compressive force acting on the spine can be attributed to muscle tension (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0315"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.62</span></a>). Similarly, muscle forces acting on the knee can exceed body weight by a factor of 200–400% during stair climbing and during deep squatting movements. Muscle forces can exceed the strength of adjacent bones if they contract in alarm, so that normal inhibitory reflexes are suppressed; it is not uncommon for vertebrae to be crushed by muscle tension during major epileptic fits. According to Newton's Second Law of motion (force = mass × acceleration), muscle forces rise to high levels when attempting to accelerate body parts, e.g. during jumping or throwing: it follows that any attempt to achieve maximum acceleration will naturally require maximal muscle <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="124" id="pagebreak_124"/><a id="pg124"/>tension. The size and potential dangers of internal muscle forces are often overlooked, leading some authors to draw spurious distinctions between weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing joints, and to suggest erroneously that only the former are subjected to high loading. It is likely that a watchmaker's finger joints are subjected to stresses as high, and as often, as those applied to his ankles.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0315"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-62-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0315"/><a id="fspara0315"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.62</span> During manual labour, muscle tension often rises to high levels in order to generate sufficient bending moment to move external objects. In this example, the back muscles act only a short distance (d) from the pivot point in the intervertebral discs (O), whereas the weight being lifted acts on a much bigger lever arm (D). In order for the moments to balance, the back muscle tension (F) must exceed the weight being lifted (W) by the ratio of D/d.

A pure rotation involves no translation, merely a pivoting of the bone about some fixed point or centre of rotation. Spin (twisting) is the rotation of a bone about its mechanical axis, which for a long bone would coincide with its long axis. Spin can occur in conjunction with other joint rotations (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0330"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.65</span></a>).

For example, the close-packed position of the knee joint corresponds to full extension. In other (loose-packed) positions, the surfaces of incongruent joints are less closely matched, and are able to move relative to each other by a combination of spin, roll and slide (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/sec-s0010.xhtml#f0335"><span class="bold">Fig. 5.66</span></a>). In final close-packing, when surfaces are most congruent and in maximal contact, the fibrous capsule and joint ligaments are maximally ‘spiralized’ and tensed, so no further movement is possible. The joint is said to be ‘screwed home’. Close-packed surfaces cannot be separated by normal external force (as they may be in other positions), and bones can be regarded as temporarily locked, as if no joint existed. Any force that tends to further movement can only be resisted by contraction of appropriate muscles, and if these fail, the joint is vulnerable to injury.

Cells detect any change in maximum strain and respond by producing more (or less) extracellular matrix, which increases (or decreases) the modulus (stiffness) of the tissue until peak strain returns to normal levels. This negative feedback ensures that bone adapts (remodels) to suit its immediate mechanical environment (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_21">Currey 2002</a>).

Therefore the mechanical properties of adjacent tissues remain suitably matched. However, different tissues cannot adapt at the same rate: highly vascularized tissues such as muscle and bone can adapt rapidly, whereas poorly vascularized tissues such as tendon do not. Avascular tissues such as articular cartilage and intervertebral discs adapt so slowly that turnover times for some matrix macromolecules can exceed 100 years. Consequently large differences in adaptive potential between adjacent musculoskeletal tissues could lead to problems in the less well-vascularized tissue when levels of mechanical loading increase abruptly (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_8">Adams and Dolan 1997</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0345"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000057/main.assets/f05-68-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0345"/><a id="fspara0345"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 5.68</span> Adaptive remodelling is the process by which musculoskeletal tissues adapt to prevailing mechanical demands.

(The pore pressure in a ‘biphasic’ solid such as articular cartilage can vary from place to place and is not equivalent to a single fluid pressure.) Muscle cells respond to strain and microinjury, which may disturb intracellular proteins such as titin.

Experiments on cadaveric intervertebral discs confirmed that measured compressive stresses decrease markedly in the immediate vicinity of damage and increase greatly in adjacent intact tissue (<a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057_bib.xhtml#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Adams et al 2013</a>).
