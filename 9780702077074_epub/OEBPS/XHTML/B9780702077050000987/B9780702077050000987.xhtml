Most medical schools include medical imaging as a core component of their anatomy syllabus. Ongoing developments in medical technology have enabled us to visualize living anatomy with far greater detail. Higher-field magnetic resonance imaging (e.g. 3 Tesla MRI) is perhaps the best known of these advances, but there have been contributing improvements across all imaging modalities. From a clinical perspective, the ability to see greater detail can be a blessing in disguise: radiologists have had to develop interpretive skills alongside their anatomical knowledge to ensure that they understand what they are seeing.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">Limitations on visualization remain, often defined by the modality used to image a particular body region, which means that the wealth of information now available to us must be considered in the context of how the images were acquired. Imaging such as MRI and ultrasound can be pre-arranged for educational purposes, whereas modalities that involve exposure to ionizing radiation such as computed tomography (CT) and radiography cannot. Therefore we must rely on clinical imaging acquisitions to be furnished with as close to ideal anatomy as possible. Patient positioning, physiology and individual anatomical variation all come into the mix, factors that challenge radiologists daily.</div><div class="text" id="p0020"><a href="#f0010">Fig. I.1.1</a> shows how a small change in the axis of multiplanar reformatting through a CT image volume of the thorax can subtly change the anatomy displayed. In the top row, the axial, sagittal and coronal slices are taken with respect to the gantry, while in the bottom row these planes are set with respect to the vertebral body of T5. There are distinct topographical differences within each pair of images. Taking the axial plane as an example, note how the aortic arch (red arrow) is present in the top image, but is not seen in bottom image. Likewise, the carina (green arrow) is not seen in the top image, but is just seen in the bottom image. Finally, the whole chest seems wider (in the anteroposterior dimension) in the bottom image, also with a different configuration of the ribs. If the same patient were to get up and lie down again on the gantry for a second examination just moments later, would they be in the same position and would a slice at T5 axial to the plane of the gantry show the same information? (The answer is no.) Since image plane acquisitions are routinely standardized with respect to the gantry, individual anatomical variations between patients mean that body positioning also affects imaging planes. But as this exercise shows, it is possible to manipulate orthogonal imaging planes with multiplanar reformats to overcome this effect when reviewing an image set at workstation. This at least means that we can attempt to review imaging with some anatomical consistency across individuals.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000987/main.assets/on98-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. I.1.1</span> CT scan of the thorax with intravenous contrast medium.

For example, a different depth of inspiration would give a different lung volume (similar to the effect seen above with respect to the anteroposterior chest diameter) and a different respiratory diaphragm level, shifting mobile abdominal organs to a different position. A hyperdynamic state might also push intravenous contrast medium through the heart and lungs more quickly, meaning<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1464.e131" id="pagebreak_1464.e131"/> that the scan would have to be acquired earlier after injection to achieve the same contrast opacification of the pulmonary vasculature. This is a key skill that radiographers develop in order to see meaningful patterns of contrast opacification in different vessels and perfused tissues. For example, in choosing a protocol in order to visualize the pulmonary arterial system to exclude a pulmonary embolism, if an acquisition is too early, then the contrast medium will sit in the peripheral venous system or right side of the heart, whereas if acquisition is too late, contrast medium will have passed beyond the left side of the heart: both will lead to a non-diagnostic scan from inadequate opacification of the pulmonary arterial tree.</div><div class="text" id="p0030"><a href="#f0015">Fig. I.1.2</a> demonstrates another visualization challenge for radiologists, namely how to see all tissue types in the same image. A feature of most medical imaging is that it can contain more grayscale information than the human eye can process. As a result, information is lost when displayed on screen. In this figure, the same underlying image information has simply been viewed with different brightness and contrast settings, but note how different structures stand out in each. The ‘soft tissue’ window clearly shows greater definition between fat, muscle, lymph nodes and the vascular structures of the mediastinum; the ‘lung’ window shows vessels, airways and the septal/lobular structure of the lungs; the ‘bone’ window shows greater skeletal detail. Each must be reviewed according to the clinical question at hand. In the same way, an appropriate window must be chosen to review certain anatomical structures.</div><section><a id="sf0015"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000987/main.assets/on98-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. I.1.2</span> CT scan of the thorax with intravenous contrast medium at the level of T5.

They have placed tools for 3D image reconstruction, manipulation and navigation (such as seen in <a href="#f0010">Figs I.1.1</a>–<a href="#f0015">I.1.2</a>) in the hands of anatomists and their students, and have greatly enhanced an understanding of important structural relationships in the human body. However, it is important to remember that a <span class="italic">single</span> image rarely holds all the necessary cues for learning these relationships and therefore, whenever possible, many slices in different planes should be examined.</div><div class="text" id="p0040">One near-certain means to improve educational experiences will be to continue to collaborate in imaging projects and publications. In this way, hopefully the skills of experts in anatomy and medical imaging will continue to bear fruit for the students of both disciplines.</div><div class="text" id="p10010">abcd</div></section></section></body></html>
