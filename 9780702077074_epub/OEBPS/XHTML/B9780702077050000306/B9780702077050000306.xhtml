The thalamus and hypothalamus are the largest components on the diencephalon, located dorsal and ventral, respectively, to the small hypothalamic sulcus of the third ventricle. The thalamus is formed by the dorsal thalamus, subdivided into the anterior, medial, lateral, intralaminar and midline nuclear groups, as well as the geniculate bodies, and the reticular nucleus surrounds the dorsal thalamus anteriorly and laterally. The hypothalamus is divided into periventricular, medial and lateral regions, which contain specific nuclei. The hypothalamus is closely linked to the hypophysis through the hypothalamohypophysial and hypothalamoinfundibular tracts. The hypophysis is subdivided into a posterior lobe or neurohypophysis and an anterior lobe or adenohypophysis. The subthalamus is a complex region containing neuronal groups (zona incerta, subthalamic nucleus and fields of Forel) and tracts (ansa lenticularis, fasciculus lenticularis and fasciculus thalamicus). The epithalamus is formed by the paraventricular thalamic nucleui, the habenular complex and the pineal gland or epiphysis.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">epiphysis; habenula; hypophysial portal system; hypophysis; hypothalamus; subthalamus; thalamus</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The diencephalon is part of the prosencephalon (forebrain), which develops from the most rostral primary cerebral vesicle that differentiates into the caudal diencephalon and the rostral telencephalon. The cerebral hemispheres, containing the lateral ventricles, develop from the telencephalon. The sites of evagination of the telencephalon become the interventricular foramina, through which the two lateral ventricles and the midline third ventricle communicate. The diencephalon corresponds largely to the structures that develop lateral to the third ventricle.

In general, thalamic nuclei both project to and receive fibres from the cerebral cortex (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Jones 2007</a>, <a href="#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_38">Sherman 2016</a>) (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 30.4</a>). The thalamus is the major route by which subcortical neuronal activity influences the cerebral cortex, and the greatest input to most thalamic nuclei comes from the cerebral cortex. Some thalamic nuclei are connected with the basal ganglia and the amygdala.</div><div class="text" id="p0050">The connections between the dorsal thalamus and the cerebral cortex are reciprocal; each cortical area projects in a topographically organized manner to all sites in the thalamus from which it receives an input (see <a href="#t0015">Table 30.2</a>). Thalamocortical fibres terminate predominantly in layer IV of the cortex. Corticothalamic fibres arise mostly from modified pyramidal cells of layer VI. In addition, some thalamic nuclei, the ‘high-order’ or ‘association’ nuclei, receive corticothalamic fibres from layer V pyramidal neurones; these fibres are collaterals of axons projecting to other subcortical nuclei. The reticular nucleus is connected reciprocally to all thalamic nuclei and receives input from corticothalamic fibres arising in layer VI but it does not project to the cortex.</div><div class="text" id="p0055">The dorsal thalamic nuclei contain projection neurones (approximately 70%), and local circuit interneurones (30%). They are divided into ‘relay’ or ‘first-order’ nuclei that mediate finely organized and precisely transmitted sensory and motor information to discrete cortical sensory and motor areas, and ‘association’ or ‘high-order’ nuclei that have more complex integrative functions (<a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">Rovó et al 2012</a>, <a href="#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Sherman 2016</a>).

Association nuclei receive their ‘driver’ input from layer V pyramidal neurones in association cortical areas and participate in cortico-thalamo-cortical transmission. Both relay and association nuclei receive ‘modulatory’ input from layer VI pyramidal neurones of the cerebral cortex. All thalamic nuclei receive ‘non-specific’ subcortical input from cholinergic and aminergic (serotoninergic, histaminergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic, adrenergic) axons arising in the brainstem and basal telencephalon.</div><section><a id="s0015"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0025">Anterior thalamic nuclei</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0060">The anterior thalamic nuclei are relay or first-order nuclei, believed to be involved in the regulation of alertness and attention and in the acquisition of memory. They lie between the arms of the Y-shaped internal medullary lamina, and underlie the anterior thalamic tubercle (see <a href="../B9780702077050000288/B9780702077050000288.xhtml#f0030">Figs 28.5</a>, <a href="#f0025">30.4</a>). Three subdivisions are recognized: the largest is the anteroventral nucleus, the others are the anteromedial and anterodorsal nuclei. These nuclei are the principal recipients of the mammillothalamic tract, which arises from the mammillary nuclei of the hypothalamus. (The mammillary nuclei receive fibres from the hippocampal formation via the fornix). The medial mammillary nucleus projects to the anteroventral and anteromedial thalamic nuclei, and the lateral mammillary nucleus projects to the anterodorsal nucleus. The nuclei of the anterior group also receive a prominent cholinergic input from the basal forebrain and the brainstem. The cortical targets of efferent fibres from the anterior nuclei of the thalamus lie largely on the medial surface of the hemisphere. They include the anterior limbic area (anterior and inferior to the corpus callosum), the cingulate gyrus and the parahippocampal gyrus (including the medial entorhinal cortex, presubiculum and parasubiculum). There also appear to be minor connections between the anterior nuclei and the dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior areas of neocortex.</div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0030">Medial thalamic nuclei</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0065">The single component of this thalamic region is the mediodorsal (dorsomedial) nucleus, an association nucleus, which is particularly large in humans. Laterally, it is limited by the internal medullary lamina and intralaminar nuclei. Medially, it abuts the midline parataenial and reuniens (medioventral) nuclei. It consists of a smaller, anteromedial magnocellular division and a larger, posterolateral parvocellular division.</div><div class="text" id="p0070">The anteromedial magnocellular division receives olfactory input from the piriform and adjacent cortex, the ventral pallidum and the amygdala. The mediobasal amygdaloid nucleus projects to the dorsal part of the anteromedial magnocellular nucleus, and the lateral nuclei project to the more central and anteroventral regions. The magnocellular division projects to the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex, notably to the lateral posterior and central posterior olfactory areas on the orbital surface of the frontal lobe. Fibres also pass to the ventromedial cingulate cortex and to the inferior parietal cortex and anterior insula. These cortical connections are reciprocal.</div><div class="text" id="p0075">The posterolateral parvocellular division is connected reciprocally with the dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate gyrus and the supplementary motor area. Efferent fibres also pass to the posterior parietal cortex.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">The mediodorsal nucleus appears to be involved in a wide variety of higher functions. Damage may lead to a decrease in anxiety, tension, aggression or obsessive thinking. There may also be transient amnesia, with confusion developing particularly over the passage of time. Much of the neuropsychology of medial nuclear damage reflects defects in functions similar to those performed by the prefrontal cortex, with which it is closely linked, and the effects of ablation of the mediodorsal nuclei parallel, in part, the results of prefrontal lobotomy.</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0035">Lateral thalamic nuclei</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0085">The lateral nuclear complex, lying lateral to the internal medullary lamina, is the largest division of the thalamus and is divided into dorsal and ventral tiers of nuclei. The lateral dorsal nucleus, lateral posterior nucleus and the pulvinar all lie dorsally. The lateral and medial geniculate nuclei lie inferior to the pulvinar near the posterior pole of the thalamus. The ventral tier nuclei are the ventral anterior, ventral lateral and ventral posterior nuclei.</div><section><a id="s0030"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0040">Ventral anterior nucleus</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0090">The ventral anterior (VA) nuclear complex lies at the anterior pole of the ventral nuclear group. It is limited anteriorly by the reticular nucleus and posteriorly by the ventral lateral nucleus, and lies between the external and internal medullary laminae. It consists of a principal part (VApc) and a magnocellular part (VAmc). The subcortical connections to this region are largely ipsilateral from the medial (internal) globus pallidus and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. These afferents use γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a neurotransmitter: they are inhibitory and therefore unusual among the ‘driver’ inputs to relay nuclei which are typically glutamatergic <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="491" id="pagebreak_491"/><a id="pg491"/>and excitatory. The pallidal and nigral terminal fields do not overlap in the ventral anterior nuclear complex: fibres from the globus pallidus end in the principal part of the nuclear complex and the substantia nigra pars reticulata, projects to the magnocellular part of the nuclear complex. Corticothalamic fibres from the premotor cortex (area 6) terminate in the principal part and fibres from the frontal eye field (area 8) terminate in the magnocellular part. The efferent projections from the ventral anterior nuclear complex are incompletely known; it projects to widespread regions of the frontal lobe and to the parietal cortex. Their functions are also unclear: the ventral anterior thalamus appears to play a central role in the transmission of the cortical ‘recruiting response’, a phenomenon in which stimulation of the thalamus can initiate long-lasting, high-voltage, repetitive negative electrical waves over much of the cerebral cortex.</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0045">Ventral lateral nucleus</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0095">The ventral lateral (VL) nucleus may be considered a motor relay nucleus: it consists of two major divisions with distinctly different connections and functions. The anterior division, or pars oralis (VLo), receives topographically organized fibres from the ipsilateral medial globus pallidus. The posterior division, or pars caudalis (VLc), receives topographically organized fibres from the contralateral deep cerebellar nuclei. Additional subcortical projections have been reported from the spinothalamic tract and the vestibular nuclei. Numerous cortical afferents to both the pars oralis and the pars caudalis originate from precentral motor cortical areas, including both area 4 and area 6.</div><div class="text" id="p0100">The pars oralis of the ventral lateral nucleus sends efferent fibres mostly to the supplementary motor cortex on the medial surface of the hemisphere and to the lateral premotor cortex. The pars caudalis of the ventral lateral nucleus projects efferent fibres mostly to the primary motor cortex, where they end in a topographically arranged fashion.

Taste fibres synapse most anteriorly and ventromedially within the ventral posterolateral nucleus.</div><div class="text" id="p0125">At a more detailed level, single body regions are represented as curved lamellae of neurones, parallel to the lateral border of the ventral posterior nucleus, such that there is a continuous overlapping progression of adjacent receptive fields from dorsolateral to ventromedial. Considerably less change in location of receptive field on the body is seen when passing anteroposteriorly through the nucleus. While not precisely dermatomal in nature, these curvilinear lamellae of cells are probably derived from afferents related to a few adjacent spinal segments. There is considerable distortion of the body map within the nucleus, reflecting the differences in the density of peripheral innervation that occur in different body regions, e.g. many more neurones respond to stimulation of the hand than of the trunk. Within a single lamella, neurones in the anterodorsal part of the nucleus respond to deep stimuli, including movement of joints, tendon stretch and manipulation of muscles. Most ventrally, neurones once again respond to deep stimuli, particularly tapping. Intervening cells within a single lamella respond only to cutaneous stimuli. This organization has been confirmed by recordings made in the human ventral posterior nucleus.</div><div class="text" id="p0130">Single lemniscal axons have an extended anteroposterior terminal zone within the nucleus. Rods of cells running the length of the anteroposterior, dorsoventrally orientated lamellae respond with closely similar receptive field properties and locations, derived from a small bundle of lemniscal afferents. It appears, therefore, that each lamella contains the complete representation of a single body part, e.g. a finger. Lamellae consist of multiple narrow rods of neurones, orientated anteroposteriorly, each of which receives input from the same small region of the body that is represented within the lamella, and from the same type of receptors. These thalamic ‘rods’ form the basis for both place- and modality-specific input to columns of cells in the somatic sensory cortex. Spinothalamic tract afferents to the ventral posterolateral nucleus terminate throughout the nucleus. The neurones from which these axons originate appear to be mainly of the ‘wide-dynamic-range’ class, responding to both low-threshold mechanoreceptors and high-threshold nociceptors; a smaller proportion of neurones respond exclusively to high-threshold nociceptors. Some neurones respond to temperature changes. There is evidence that spinothalamic tract neurones carrying nociceptive and thermal information terminate in a distinct nuclear area, identified as the posterior part of the ventral medial nucleus (VMpo).</div><div class="text" id="p0135">The ventral posterior nucleus projects to the primary somatic sensory cortex (SI) of the postcentral gyrus and to the second somatic sensory area (SII) in the parietal operculum.

It is located within the medial geniculate body, a rounded elevation situated posteriorly on the ventrolateral surface of the thalamus, separated from the pulvinar by the brachium of the superior colliculus. It receives fibres travelling in the brachium of the inferior colliculus. The medial geniculate nucleus contains three major subnuclei, medial (magnocellular), ventral and dorsal. The inferior brachium separates the medial nucleus, which consists of sparse, deeply staining neurones, from the lateral region, which consists of medium-sized, densely packed and darkly staining neurones. In the lateral region, the dorsal nucleus overlies the ventral nucleus and expands posteriorly; it is sometimes known as the posterior nucleus of the medial geniculate. It contains small- to medium-sized, pale-staining neurones that are less densely packed than those of the ventral nucleus.</div><div class="text" id="p0145">The dorsal nucleus receives afferents from the pericentral nucleus of the inferior colliculus and from other brainstem nuclei of the auditory pathway and projects to auditory areas surrounding the primary auditory cortex. Neurones within the dorsal nucleus respond to a broad range of frequencies and a tonotopic representation has not been described in this subdivision. The ventral nucleus receives fibres from the central nucleus of the ipsilateral inferior colliculus via the brachium of the inferior colliculus and from the contralateral inferior colliculus and projects primarily to the primary auditory cortex. It contains a complete tonotopic representation: low-pitched sounds are represented laterally, and progressively higher-pitched sounds are encountered as the nucleus is traversed from lateral to medial.

It is a typical association nucleus that is greatly expanded in humans. It has four major subdivisions, the anterior, medial, lateral and inferior pulvinar nuclei. The anterior pulvinar is posterior to the ventral posteromedial nucleus and lateral to the posterior intralaminar nuclei. The medial pulvinar nucleus is dorsomedial and consists of compact, evenly spaced neurones. The lateral pulvinar nucleus lies laterally, and is traversed by bundles of axons in the mediolateral plane, an arrangement that confers a fragmented appearance of horizontal cords or sheets of cells separated by bundles of fibres. The inferior pulvinar nucleus lies most inferiorly and laterally.</div><div class="text" id="p0200">The subcortical afferents to the pulvinar are uncertain. Medial and lateral pulvinar nuclei may receive fibres from the superior colliculus. It has been suggested that the inferior pulvinar nucleus receives fibres both from the superior colliculus and directly from the retina, and that it contains a complete retinotopic representation.</div><div class="text" id="p0205">The cortical targets of efferent fibres from the pulvinar are widespread. In essence, the anterior pulvinar nucleus projects to posterior parietal somatosensory association areas and to the insula; the medial pulvinar nucleus projects to association areas of the frontoparietotemporal cortex; and the lateral and inferior pulvinar nuclei project to visual areas in the occipitoparietotemporal cortex. Thus, the inferior pulvinar nucleus connects with the striate and extrastriate cortex in the occipital lobe, and with visual association areas in the posterior part of the temporal lobe. The lateral pulvinar nucleus connects with extrastriate areas of the occipital cortex, with posterior parts of the temporal association cortex and with the parietal cortex. The medial pulvinar nucleus connects with the inferior parietal cortex, with the posterior cingulate gyrus and with widespread areas of the temporal lobe, including the posterior parahippocampal gyrus and perirhinal and entorhinal cortex, and also has extensive connections with prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices.</div><div class="text" id="p0210">Little is known of the functions of the pulvinar. The inferior pulvinar nucleus contains a complete retinotopic representation, and lateral and medial pulvinar nuclei also contain visually responsive cells. However, the latter nucleus, at least, is not purely visual: other modality responses can be recorded and some cells may be polysensory. Given the complexity of functions of the association areas to which they project, particularly in the temporal lobe (e.g. perception, cognition and memory), it is likely that the role of the pulvinar in modulating these functions is equally complex.</div><div class="text" id="p0215">Anteriorly, the major subdivisions of the pulvinar blend into a poorly differentiated region, within which several nuclear components have been recognized, including the suprageniculate limitans nucleus and the posterior nuclei. The connectivity of this complex is also not well understood. It is recognized that different components receive subcortical afferents from the spinothalamic tract and the superior and inferior colliculi. Cortical connections centre primarily on the insula and adjacent parts of the parietal operculum posteriorly. Stimulation of this region has been reported to elicit pain, and large lesions may alleviate painful conditions. Similarly, excision of its cortical target in the parietal operculum, or small infarcts in this cortical region, may result in hypoalgesia.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0070"/><section><a id="s0075"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0080">Intralaminar nuclei</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0220">The term intralaminar nuclei refers to collections of neurones within the internal medullary lamina of the thalamus (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 30.4</a>). Two groups of nuclei are recognized. The anterior (rostral) group is subdivided into central medial, paracentral and central lateral nuclei. The posterior (caudal) intralaminar group consists of the centromedian and parafascicular nuclei. The designations central medial and centromedian are open to confusion but they are an accepted part of the terminology of thalamic nuclei that is in common usage. The centromedian nucleus is much larger, is considerably expanded in humans in comparison with other species, and is importantly related to the globus pallidus, striatum, deep cerebellar nuclei and motor cortex. Anteriorly, the internal medullary lamina separates the mediodorsal nucleus from the ventral lateral complex. It is occupied by the paracentral nucleus laterally, and the central medial nucleus ventromedially, as the two laminae converge towards the midline. A little more posteriorly, the central lateral nucleus appears dorsally in the lamina as the latter splits to enclose the lateral dorsal nucleus. More posteriorly, at the level of the ventral posterior nucleus, the lamina splits to enclose the ovoid centromedian nucleus. The smaller parafascicular nucleus lies more medially.</div><div class="text" id="p0225">The anterior intralaminar nuclei, i.e. central medial, paracentral and central lateral, have reciprocal connections with widespread cortical areas. There is some evidence of regional specificity: the central lateral nucleus projects mainly to parietal and temporal association areas; the paracentral nucleus to occipitotemporal and prefrontal cortex; and the central medial nucleus to orbitofrontal and prefrontal cortex and to the cortex on the medial surface. In contrast, the posterior nuclei, i.e. centromedian and parafascicular nuclei, have more restricted connections, principally with the motor, premotor and supplementary motor areas. Both anterior and posterior intralaminar nuclei also project to the striatum. Many cells throughout the anterior nuclei have branched axons that pass to both the cortex and the striatum. Dual projections are less frequent in the posterior nuclei. The thalamostriate projection is topographically organized. The posterior intralaminar nuclei receive a major input from the internal pallidum. Additional afferents come from the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, the deep cerebellar nuclei, the pedunculopontine nucleus of the caudal midbrain, and possibly the spinothalamic tract. The anterior nuclei have widespread subcortical afferents. The central lateral nucleus receives afferents from the spinothalamic tract, and all component nuclei receive fibres from the brainstem reticular formation, the superior colliculus and several pretectal nuclei. Afferents to all intralaminar nuclei from the brainstem include a prominent cholinergic pathway.</div><div class="text" id="p0230">The precise functional role of the intralaminar nuclei is unclear. They appear to mediate cortical activation from the brainstem reticular formation and to play a part in sensory–motor integration. Damage to the intralaminar nuclei may contribute to thalamic neglect, i.e. the unilateral neglect of stimuli originating from the contralateral body or extra-personal space. This may arise particularly from unilateral damage to the centromedian–parafascicular complex. The latter has been targeted in humans for the neurosurgical control of pain and epilepsy. Bilateral injury to the posterior intralaminar nuclei leads to a kinetic mutism with apathy and loss of motivation. A second syndrome associated with damage involving the intralaminar nuclei is that of unilateral motor neglect, in which there is contralateral paucity of spontaneous movement and motor activity.</div></section><section><a id="s0080"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0085">Midline nuclei</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0235">There is considerable divergence between different authorities as to which elements of the medial diencephalon constitute the nuclei of the midline thalamic group.

They are the major thalamic target of ascending dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotoninergic axons from the midbrain and pons, locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei, respectively, and they also receive a cholinergic input from the midbrain. Efferents from the midline nuclei pass to the hippocampal formation, the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens. Additional thalamocortical axons reach the cingulate, and possibly the orbitofrontal, cortex. The dual cortical and basal nuclear relationship of these nuclei has often led to their being considered a part of the intralaminar system. The cortical projections are reciprocal. The relationships of the midline nuclei clearly identify them as part of the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="495" id="pagebreak_495"/><a id="pg495"/>limbic system.

It is a curved lamella of large, deeply staining fusiform neurones that wraps around the lateral margin of the thalamus, separated from it by the external medullary lamina. Anteriorly, it curves around the rostral pole of the thalamus. The nucleus is so named because it is criss-crossed by bundles of fibres that, as they pass between thalamus and cortex, produce a reticular appearance.</div><div class="text" id="p0250">The reticular nucleus receives collateral branches of corticothalamic, thalamocortical and probably thalamostriatal and pallidothalamic fibres as they traverse it. It receives additional cholinergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotoninergic afferents. Broadly speaking, the afferents from the cortex and thalamus are topographically arranged. The reticular nucleus contains visual, somatic and auditory regions, each with a crude topographic representation of each sensorium. Cells within these regions respond to visual, somatic or auditory stimuli with a latency, suggesting that these properties arise from activation by thalamocortical axon collaterals. Cells only show modality convergence in areas where representations abut.</div><div class="text" id="p0255">The efferent fibres from the reticular nucleus pass into the body of the thalamus and are GABAergic.

The tuber cinereum, between the mammillary bodies and the optic chiasma, is a convex mass of grey matter from which the median, conical, hollow infundibulum becomes continuous ventrally with the posterior lobe of the hypophysis (neurohypophysis). Around the base of the infundibulum, the median eminence is demarcated by a shallow tubero-infundibular sulcus.</div><div class="text" id="p0275">Hypothalamic lesions have long been linked with widespread and bizarre endocrine syndromes and with metabolic, visceral, motor and emotional disturbances. The hypothalamus has major interactions with the neuroendocrine system and the autonomic nervous system, integrating responses to both internal and external afferent stimuli with the complex analysis of the world provided by the cerebral cortex.</div><div class="text" id="p0280">The hypothalamus controls the endocrine system in a variety of ways: via magnocellular neurosecretory projections to the neurohypophysis; via parvocellular neurosecretory projections to the median eminence (these control the endocrine output of the anterior hypophysis and thereby the peripheral endocrine organs); and via the autonomic nervous system (<a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_31">Nieuwenhuys 1985</a>). The posterior hypophysial neurohormones, vasopressin and oxytocin, are primarily involved in the control of osmotic homeostasis and various aspects of reproductive function, respectively. Through its effects on the anterior hypophysis, the hypothalamus influences the thyroid gland (thyroid-stimulating hormone, TSH); suprarenal cortex (adrenocorticotrophic hormone, ACTH); gonads (luteinizing hormone, LH; follicle-stimulating hormone, FSH; prolactin); mammary gland (prolactin); and the processes of growth and metabolic homeostasis (growth hormone, GH).</div><div class="text" id="p0285">The hypothalamus influences both parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Broadly speaking, parasympathetic effects predominate when the anterior hypothalamus is stimulated and sympathetic effects depend more on the posterior hypothalamus.</div><div class="text" id="p0290">Stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus and paraventricular nucleus can cause decreased blood pressure and decreased heart rate. Stimulation in the anterior hypothalamus induces sweating and vasodilation (and thus heat loss) via projections that pass through the medial forebrain bundle to autonomic centres in the brainstem and spinal cord. Damage to the anterior hypothalamus, e.g. during surgery for suprasellar extensions of pituitary tumours, can result in an uncontrollable rise in body temperature. The ventromedial hypothalamus regulates food intake; damage to this nucleus during surgery for hypothalamic lesions (e.g. craniopharyngioma) can result in uncontrolled eating and consequent obesity. Stimulation in the posterior part of the hypothalamus induces sympathetic arousal, producing vasoconstriction, piloerection, shivering and increased metabolic heat production. Circuitry mediating shivering is located in the dorsomedial posterior hypothalamus. This does not, however, imply the existence of discrete parasympathetic and sympathetic ‘centres’. Stimuli in many different parts of the hypothalamus can cause profound changes in heart rate, cardiac output, vasomotor tone, peripheral resistance, differential blood flow in organs and limbs, the frequency and depth of respiration, motility and secretion in the alimentary tract, erection and ejaculation.</div><section><a id="s0095"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0100">Hypothalamic zones and nuclei</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0295">The hypothalamus contains a number of neuronal groups that have been classified on phylogenetic, developmental, cytoarchitectonic, synaptic and histochemical grounds into named nuclei, many of which are not very clearly delimited, especially in the adult.

Between the intermediate and lateral zones is a paramedian plane that contains the prominent myelinated fibres of the fornix, the mammillothalamic tract and the fasciculus retroflexus. For this reason, some authorities group the periventricular and intermediate zones as a single medial zone. These divisions are artificial and functional systems cross them.

The chiasmatic region contains part of the sexually dimorphic medial preoptic nucleus, the suprachiasmatic and supraoptic nuclei, and periventricular neurones that are medial to, and blend with, the paraventricular nucleus. In the tuberal region, the periventricular cell group expands around the base of the third ventricle to form the arcuate nucleus, which overlies the median eminence.

Sometimes called the master circadian pacemaker in mammals, it appears to be the neural substrate for day–night cycles in motor activity, body temperature, plasma concentration of many hormones, renal secretion, sleeping and waking, and numerous other variables. Lesions of the suprachiasmatic region lead to a disordered sleep–wake cycle.

The dorsomedial subdivision has a relatively sparse afferent innervation, and characteristically contains parvocellular neurones that are immunoreactive for arginine vasopressin (AVP). Neurones within the suprachiasmatic nuclei that receive a direct retinal input do not respond to pattern, movement or colour, but operate as luminance detectors, responding to the onset and offset of light: their firing rates vary in proportion to light intensity, thereby synchronizing to the light–dark cycle.</div><div class="pageavoid"><p class="tnum">TABLE 30.3</p><div class="big_device"><table id="t0020" class="tbody"><caption class="ttitle"><a id="tspara0030"/>Main hypothalamic nuclei and their functions</caption><thead><tr><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">Region</th><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1"/><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">Nucleus</th><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">Hormone secreted</th><th scope="col" class="tcolhd1">Function</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope="row" class="tb" rowspan="5">Chiasmatic</th><td class="tb" rowspan="3">Medial</td><td class="tb">Median preoptic</td><td class="tb">GnRH</td><td class="tb"/></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="tb">Periventricular</th><td class="tb">GnRH, somatostatin, CRH, TRH</td><td class="tb"/></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="tb">Suprachiasmatic</th><td class="tb"/><td class="tb">‘Master’ clock</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="tb" rowspan="2">Intermediate</th><td class="tb">Supraoptic</td><td class="tb">Vasopressin</td><td class="tb"/></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="tb">Paraventricular</th><td class="tb">Vasopressin, oxytocin</td><td class="tb"/></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="tb" rowspan="4">Tuberal</th><td class="tb" rowspan="3">Medial</td><td class="tb">Dorsomedial</td><td class="tb">TRH, ANP</td><td class="tb"/></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="tb">Ventromedial</th><td class="tb">TRH</td><td class="tb">‘Satiety centre’</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="tb">Arcuate</th><td class="tb">GHRH, dopamine</td><td class="tb">Secrete to portal system</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="tb">Lateral</th><td class="tb">Lateral</td><td class="tb"/><td class="tb">‘Feeding centre’</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" class="tb">Posterior</th><td class="tb">Medial</td><td class="tb">Mammillary body</td><td class="tb"/><td class="tb">Memory</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="small_device"><p class="table_fig"><img src="B9780702077050000306_t0020_0.png" alt="image"/></p></div><footer><p class="tftnote">Abbreviations: ANP, atrial natriuretic peptide; CRH, corticotrophin-releasing hormone; GHRH, growth hormone-releasing hormone; GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone; TRH, thyrotrophin-releasing hormone.</p></footer></div><div class="text" id="p0320">The suprachiasmatic nucleus receives glutamatergic afferents from melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells that entrain the rhythm to the light–dark cycle. The rhythm persists in blind patients suffering from retinitis pigmentosa or other conditions that affect the retinal photoreceptors because the melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells are intrinsically sensitive to light (i.e. they do not depend on photoreceptor inputs). The suprachiasmatic nucleus contains many different neurotransmitters, including vasopressin, VIP, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and neurotensin. Axons from the suprachiasmatic nucleus pass to numerous other hypothalamic nuclei, including the paraventricular, ventromedial, dorsomedial and arcuate nuclei.</div><div class="text" id="p0325">The suprachiasmatic nucleus also influences the activity of preganglionic sympathetic neurones in the upper part of the thoracolumbar outflow. These neurones project to neurones in the superior cervical ganglion, which project to the pineal gland. Circadian variation in this postganglionic sympathetic input causes parallel variation in pineal <span class="italic">N</span>-acetyltransferase activity and thus pineal melatonin production. The role of the pineal gland in humans is uncertain: pineal tumours can influence reproductive development, and administration of melatonin has been advocated to alleviate jet-lag.</div></section><section><a id="s0105"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0110">Supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0330">The supraoptic nucleus curves over the lateral part of the optic chiasma. It contains a uniform population of large neurones that synthesize vasopressin and oxytocin and project to the neurohypophysis. The magnocellular vasopressin neurones detect as little as 1% increase in the osmotic pressure of the blood and stimulate release of vasopressin from the neurohypophysis: a fall in blood volume or blood pressure greater than 5–10% similarly stimulates the release of vasopressin and the urge to drink. These responses are mediated via volume receptors in the walls of the great veins and atria and baroreceptors in the carotid sinus that all project via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the nucleus tractus solitarius and thence to the magnocellular nuclei. A biochemical defect in vasopressin production, or interruption of the hypothalamohypophysial pathway (e.g. due to a head injury), can cause cranial diabetes insipidus.</div><div class="text" id="p0335">The paraventricular nucleus extends from the hypothalamic sulcus downwards across the medial aspect of the column of the fornix, its ventrolateral angle reaching towards the supraoptic nucleus. Its neurones are more diverse than those of the supraoptic nucleus. Magnocellular neurones project to the neurohypophysis and tend to lie laterally; parvocellular neurones project to the median eminence and infundibulum and lie more medially; intermediate-sized neurones may project caudally and lie posteriorly. The axons of paraventricular magnocellular neurones pass towards the supraoptic nucleus, where they join the axons of supraoptic neurones and form a hypothalamohypophysial tract that runs down the infundibulum, superficially, into the posterior hypophysis. Here, the axons are distended and branch repeatedly around the capillaries. Vasopressin and oxytocin are produced by separate neurones: those secreting vasopressin tend to cluster in the ventrolateral part of the paraventricular nucleus and neurones secreting oxytocin lie around them.</div></section><section><a id="s0110"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0115">Periventricular zone and arcuate nucleus</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0340">Parvocellular neurosecretory neurones lie principally within the periventricular zone, some in the medial parvocellular part of the paraventricular nucleus and most in the arcuate nucleus. The axons of parvocellular neurones converge on the infundibulum, forming the tubero-infundibular tract that ends on the capillary loops forming the hypophysial portal vessels.</div><div class="text" id="p0345">The arcuate nucleus is median in the post-infundibular part of the tuber cinereum. It extends forwards into the median eminence and almost encircles the infundibular base, but does not meet anteriorly, where the infundibulum adjoins the median part of the optic chiasma. Its numerous neurones are all small and round in coronal section, and oval or fusiform in sagittal section. No glial layer intervenes between the nucleus and the ependymal tanycytes that line the infundibular recess of the third ventricle. Circadian variation in the secretion of all anterior pituitary hormones suggests that projections from the suprachiasmatic nucleus must reach parvocellular neurosecretory neurones. Afferents from the limbic system probably mediate the widespread effects of stress, and 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) from the brainstem influence the output of most anterior pituitary hormones.</div><div class="text" id="p0350">Neurones producing growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) are largely restricted to the arcuate nucleus. Some extend dorsally into the periventricular nucleus and laterally into the retrochiasmatic area. Their fibres run through the periventricular region to the neurovascular zone of the median eminence. The neurones receive afferent information from glucose receptors in the ventromedial nucleus. Inputs from the hippocampal–amygdala–septal complex could explain the release of GH during stress. In humans, midline defects such as septo-optic dysplasia are associated with defective GH secretion. Dopamine has a stimulatory effect.</div><div class="text" id="p0355">Neurones producing somatostatin (growth hormone release-inhibiting hormone) are located in the periventricular zone. GHRH and somatostatin are secreted in intermittent (3–5-hour) reciprocal pulses: the origin of the pulses is unclear. A large pulse of GH is secreted at the onset of slow-wave sleep. Somatostatin also inhibits release of TSH in the adenohypophysis.</div><div class="text" id="p0360">Neurones producing gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) that project to the median eminence are located in the periventricular <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="498" id="pagebreak_498"/>zone and arcuate nucleus. Other GnRH neurones are found in the median preoptic area, but they appear to project to the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis. LH and FSH are secreted by the adenohypophysis in circhoral (hourly) pulses: secretion is stimulated by GnRH, and influenced by central monoamines and GABA; by oestrogen and progesterone acting indirectly through other neurones; by corticotrophin-releasing factor; and by endogenous opioids. Gonadotrophin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) is produced by neurones located in the dorsomedial hypothalamic area that project to the median eminence. GnIH inhibits gonadotrophin synthesis and release by decreasing the activity of GnRH neurones and also by acting directly on adenohypophysial gonadotropes.</div><div class="text" id="p0365">Corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) is located primarily in parvocellular periventricular neurones. These neurones are profoundly stimulated by neurogenic and hypoglycaemic stress, mediated by limbic input and the ventromedial nucleus, respectively, and are also controlled, via negative feedback, by cortisol levels.</div><div class="text" id="p0370">Thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) neurones are rather more widely distributed in the periventricular, ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei. TRH release is influenced by core temperature, sensed in the anterior hypothalamus, and by thyroid hormone levels, via negative feedback. It stimulates release of pituitary TSH and also acts to excite cold-sensitive neurones in the preoptic area and to inhibit warm-sensitive ones.</div><div class="text" id="p0375">Other tubero-infundibular arcuate neurones contain NPY and neurotensin. Arcuate neurones, containing pro-opiomelanocortin peptides, project to the periventricular nucleus rather than the median eminence.</div><div class="text" id="p0380">In addition to these peptide-containing cells, dopamine neurones in the arcuate nucleus (A12 group) have terminals in the median eminence and infundibulum. Dopamine acts as the principal prolactin release-inhibiting hormone, and also inhibits secretion of TSH (likewise, TSH acts as a prolactin-releasing hormone). Noradrenergic terminals are found in the median eminence, where they may act largely in a paracrine manner.</div><div class="text" id="p0385">The hypothalamus is essential for the control of oxytocin, gonadotrophin and prolactin secretion. The release of oxytocin from neurosecretory nerve terminals in the neurohypophysis induces contraction of the uterus and of the myoepithelial cells that surround the mammary gland alveoli. Two neuroendocrine reflexes are involved. Stretching of the cervix of the uterus during childbirth stimulates a multisynaptic afferent pathway that passes via the pelvic plexus, anterolateral column and brainstem to the magnocellular oxytocin neurones (the Ferguson reflex). This is a positive feedback mechanism, which is terminated by the birth of the baby. The milk ejection reflex is evoked by suckling: mechanical stimulation of the nipple activates a multisynaptic afferent connection to the hypothalamus via the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of T4 (range T3–T5), the anterolateral column and brainstem. The reflex can be both conditioned to a baby’s cry and inhibited by stress.</div></section><section><a id="s0115"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0120">Ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0390">At the tuberal level, the ventromedial nucleus is well-defined by a surrounding neurone-poor zone but the dorsomedial nucleus above it is much less distinct. The ventromedial nucleus contains neurones receptive to plasma levels of glucose and other nutrients, and receives visceral somatic afferents via the nucleus tractus solitarius. The lateral hypothalamus receives olfactory afferents that convey important food signals. Both areas receive extensive inputs from limbic structures.</div><div class="text" id="p0395">Bilateral electrolytic lesioning experiments in rats in the 1940s established the involvement of the hypothalamus in regulating food intake and body weight. The ventromedial nucleus was thought to serve as a ‘satiety centre’, while the lateral hypothalamic acted as a ‘feeding centre’. Although the validity of this dual centre model was challenged on methodological grounds (the lesions were imprecise and damaged other cells and tracts), more recent work supports the key role of the ventromedial nucleus in the complex pathways involved in the neuronal regulation of feeding (<a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Ahima and Antwi 2008</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0400">The dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus is involved in the expression of emotion: its stimulation results in aggressive behaviour that stops when the stimulation ceases.</div><div class="text" id="p0405">The ventromedial nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area and paraventricular nucleus also influence intermediate metabolism through the autonomic and endocrine systems. These appear to complement the effects on feeding behaviour. Thus, ventromedial stimulation facilitates glucagon release and increases glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis and lipolysis, whereas lateral hypothalamic stimulation causes insulin release and the opposite metabolic effects. Lesions of the ventromedial nucleus also cause increased vagal and decreased sympathetic tone.</div></section><section><a id="s0120"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0125">Mammillary bodies</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0410">The prominent medial mammillary nuclei, from which the mammillothalamic and mammillotegmental tracts arise, form the bulk of the mammillary bodies. A group of larger cells occurs along the lateral border of the medial mammillary nucleus, but the existence of a distinct lateral mammillary nucleus is controversial. The tuberomammillary nucleus is lateral to this group.</div></section><section><a id="s0125"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0130">Lateral zone of the hypothalamus</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0415">The lateral zone of the hypothalamus forms a continuum that runs from the preoptic nucleus through the lateral hypothalamic area to the posterior hypothalamus. It contains the lateral hypothalamic nucleus, the perifornical nuclei and the tuberomammillary nucleus. The perifornical nuclei contain neurones that synthetize peptides known as orexins (hypocretins) that are important to maintain wakefulness: their damage results in narcolepsy. They may be also involved in regulating food intake and energy balance. The tuberomammillary nucleus contains histaminergic neurones that diffusely innervate the entire cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, thalamus and brainstem.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0130"/><section><a id="s0135"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0135">Connections of the hypothalamus</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0420">The hypothalamus has reciprocal interaction with the rest of the body via two (possibly three) routes: neural connections, the blood stream and (possibly) the cerebrospinal fluid.</div><div class="text" id="p0425">Some hypothalamic neurones have specific receptors that sense the temperature, osmolarity, glucose, free fatty acid and hormone content of the blood. Neurosecretory neurones secrete neurohormones into the blood. These control the anterior hypophysis and act on organs such as the kidney, breast, uterus and blood vessels. Some of the neural connections, especially those to the mammillary bodies, form discrete myelinated fascicles, but most are diffuse and unmyelinated, and their origin and termination are uncertain. Most pathways are multisynaptic and many of the synapses on hypothalamic neurones are derived from intrinsic interneurones.</div><div class="text" id="p0430">Broadly, neural inputs to the hypothalamus are derived from the ascending visceral and somatic sensory systems, the visual and olfactory systems, and numerous tracts from the brainstem, thalamus, ‘limbic’ structures and neocortex. Efferent neural projections are reciprocal to most of these and, in particular, they impinge on and control the central origins of autonomic nerve fibres. The hypothalamus, therefore, exerts control via the autonomic and endocrine systems and through its connections to the telencephalon.</div><section><a id="s0140"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0140">Afferent connections</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0435">The hypothalamus receives visceral, gustatory and somatic sensory information from the spinal cord and brainstem. It receives largely polysynaptic projections from the nucleus tractus solitarius, probably directly and indirectly via the parabrachial nucleus and medullary noradrenergic cell groups (ventral noradrenergic bundle); collaterals of spinothalamic and lemniscal somatic afferents (to the lateral hypothalamus); and projections from the reticular formation. Many enter via the medial forebrain bundle (see <a href="#f0045">Fig. 30.9</a>) and periventricular fibre system. Others converge in the midbrain tegmentum, forming the mammillary peduncle to the mammillary body.</div><div class="text" id="p0440">The major forebrain inputs to the hypothalamus are derived from structures in the limbic system, including the hippocampal formation, amygdala and septum, and from the piriform cortex and adjacent neocortex. These connections, which are reciprocal, form prominent fibre systems, i.e. the fornix, stria terminalis and ventral amygdalofugal tracts.</div><div class="text" id="p0445">The hippocampal formation, and the subiculum in particular, is reciprocally connected to the hypothalamus by the fornix, a complex tract that also contains commissural connections. As the fornix curves ventrally towards the anterior commissure, it is joined by fascicles from the cingulate gyrus, indusium griseum and the septal area. It divides around the anterior commissure into pre- and postcommissural parts. The precommissural fornix is distributed to the orbital and medial frontal cortex, and to the septum and preoptic hypothalamus; the septum sends numerous fibres to the hypothalamus. The postcommissural fornix passes ventrally and posteriorly through the hypothalamus to the medial mammillary nucleus, giving off many fibres to the medial and lateral hypothalamic nuclei in its course.</div><div class="text" id="p0450">The amygdala innervates most hypothalamic nuclei anterior to the mammillary bodies. Its corticomedial nucleus innervates preoptic and anterior hypothalamic areas and the ventromedial nucleus. The central nuclei project to the lateral hypothalamus, their fibres reaching the hypothalamus by two routes. The short ventral amygdalofugal path passes medially over the optic tract, beneath the lentiform complex, to reach the hypothalamus. The long, curved stria terminalis runs parallel to the fornix, separated from it by the lateral ventricle, passes through the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and is distributed to the anterior hypothalamus via the medial forebrain bundle.</div><div class="text" id="p0455">Olfactory afferents reach the hypothalamus largely via the nucleus accumbens and septal nuclei, and most terminate in the lateral hypothalamus. Visual afferents leave the optic chiasma and pass dorsally into the suprachiasmatic nucleus. No auditory connections have been identified, though it is clear that such stimuli influence hypothalamic activity. However, many hypothalamic neurones respond best to complex sensory stimuli, suggesting that sensory information reaching the neocortex has converged and been processed by the amygdala, hippocampus and neocortex. Neocortical corticohypothalamic projections arise from frontal and insular cortices and end in lateral, chiasmatic, tuberal and posterior hypothalamic nuclei.</div><div class="text" id="p0460">Like the rest of the forebrain, the hypothalamus receives diffuse aminergic inputs from the locus coeruleus, dopaminergic nuclei and raphe nuclei.

The pineal is about 8<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm long. Its base, directed anteriorly, is attached by a peduncle, which divides into inferior and superior laminae that are separated by the pineal recess of the third ventricle and contain the posterior and habenular commissures, respectively. Aberrant commissural fibres may invade the gland but do not terminate near parenchymal cells.</div><div class="text" id="p0640">Septa extend into the pineal gland from the surrounding pia mater. They divide the gland into lobules and carry blood vessels and sympathetic axons. The pineal gland has a rich blood supply: pineal arteries are branches of the medial posterior choroidal arteries, which are themselves branches of the posterior cerebral artery. Within the gland, branches of the arteries supply fenestrated capillaries where the endothelial cells rest on a tenuous and sometimes incomplete basal lamina. The capillaries drain into numerous pineal veins that open into the internal cerebral veins and/or into the great cerebral vein. Unmyelinated postganglionic adrenergic sympathetic axons (derived from neurones in the superior cervical ganglion) enter the dorsolateral aspect of the pineal gland from the region of the tentorium cerebelli as the nervus conarii, which may be single or paired. The nerve lies deep to the endothelium of the wall of the straight sinus and is associated with intraglandular blood vessels and parenchymal cells.</div><div class="text" id="p0645">The pineal gland contains cords and clusters of pinealocytes, associated with astrocyte-like neuroglia, which are the main cellular component of the pineal stalk. Pinealocytes are highly modified neurones. They contain multiple synaptic ribbons, randomly distributed between adjacent cells, and are coupled by gap junctions. Two or more processes extend from each cell body and end in bulbous expansions near capillaries or, less frequently, on the ependymal cells of the pineal recess. These terminal expansions contain rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and dense-cored vesicles that store melatonin. Melatonin, and its precursor 5-HT (serotonin), are synthesized from tryptophan by the pinealocytes, and secreted into the surrounding network of fenestrated capillaries.</div><div class="text" id="p0650">The pineal gland is an endocrine gland of major regulatory importance (<a href="#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Macchi and Bruce 2004</a>). It modifies the activity of the adenohypophysis, neurohypophysis, endocrine pancreas, parathyroids, suprarenal cortex, suprarenal medulla and gonads. Its effects are largely inhibitory. Indoleamine and polypeptide hormones secreted by pinealocytes are believed to reduce the synthesis and release of hormones by the pars anterior, either by direct action on its secretory cells or indirectly by inhibiting production of hypothalamic releasing factors. Pineal secretions may reach their target cells via the cerebrospinal fluid or the blood stream. Some pineal indoleamines, including melatonin and enzymes for their biosynthesis (e.g. 5-HT, <span class="italic">N</span>-acetyltransferase), show circadian rhythms in concentration. The levels rise during darkness and fall during the day, when secretion may be inhibited by sympathetic activity. The intrinsic rhythmicity of an endogenous circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus apparently governs cyclical pineal behaviour (see above).</div><div class="text" id="p0655">From the second decade, calcareous deposits accumulate in pineal extracellular matrix, where they are deposited concentrically as corpora arenacea or ‘brain sand’ (<a href="#f0065"><span class="bold">Fig. 30.13</span></a>). Pineal gland and choroid plexus calcifications are the most frequent sites of intracranial calcifications that are incidentally discovered among head CT scans; calcification can provide a useful indicator of a space-occupying lesion if the gland is significantly displaced from the midline.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0065"><img
