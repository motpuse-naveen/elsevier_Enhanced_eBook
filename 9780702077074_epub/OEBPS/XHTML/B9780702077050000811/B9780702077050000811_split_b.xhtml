They originate from capillary networks in the alveolar walls and return oxygenated blood to the left atrium: they are devoid of valves. All the main tributaries of the pulmonary veins receive smaller tributaries, both intra- and intersegmental. By serial junctions, tributaries ultimately form a single lobar trunk (one for each lobe). Usually, there are three trunks in the right lung and two in the left: variations reflect the lobar arrangement of an individual. The right middle and superior lobar veins usually unite so that two veins, superior and inferior, leave each lung at the hilum: the superior pulmonary vein is anteroinferior to the pulmonary artery, and the inferior pulmonary vein is the most inferior hilar structure and slightly posterior (see <a href="../B9780702077050000549/B9780702077050000549.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 54.3</a>). The right superior pulmonary vein is formed by the union of apical, anterior and posterior veins (draining the upper lobe) with a middle lobar vein formed by lateral and medial tributaries. The right inferior pulmonary vein is formed in the hilar region by the union of superior (apical) and common basal veins from the lower lobe. The union of superior and inferior basal tributaries forms the common basal vein. Occasionally the three right lobar veins remain separate. The right superior pulmonary vein passes posterior to the superior vena cava, and the inferior passes posterior to the right atrium.</div><div class="text" id="p3430">The left superior pulmonary vein is formed by the union of apicoposterior, anterior and lingular veins. The left inferior pulmonary vein is formed by the union of the superior (apical) and common basal veins, the latter formed by the union of the superior and inferior basal veins.

The left atrium is the heart chamber most posterior and median in position, and so the length of the left and right pulmonary veins is relatively equal, unlike the arteries and bronchi, where there are obvious left–right differences in length. The terminal parts of the pulmonary veins are surrounded by atrial myocardium; these areas represent potential accessory re-entrant circuits responsible for the initiation or maintenance of supraventricular tachycardias or atrial fibrillation and may be percutaneously ablated.</div></section><section><a id="s2905"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle2340">Cardiac veins</h3><div class="textfl" id="p3445">The cardiac venous system is divided into two major parts. The greater system consists of large vessels that lie within the subepicardial myocardium and drain most of the outer myocardium.

The intercommunicating parts of this system are the coronary sinus and its tributaries, the anterior cardiac venous system and the ventricular septal and atrial veins. The coronary sinus and its tributaries return blood to the right atrium from the entire heart (including its septa), except for the anterior region of the right ventricle and small, variable parts of both atria and the left ventricle. The anterior cardiac veins drain an anterior region of the right ventricle; this expands to include a region around the right cardiac border when the right marginal vein joins this group.</div><div class="text" id="p3450">The smaller system functions primarily to return venous blood from the inner myocardial walls into the right atrium and ventricle and, to a lesser extent, into the left atrium and sometimes the left ventricle.

During embryological development, if the cardinal vein does not obliterate, it will persist as a left-sided superior vena cava. A left superior vena cava may have a slender connection with the right superior vena cava and subsequently cross the left side of the aortic arch to pass anterior to the hilum of the left lung before turning to enter the right atrium. It replaces the oblique vein of the left atrium (of Marshall) and coronary sinus, and receives all the normal tributaries of the coronary sinus. Other variations include drainage of the hemiazygos vein directly into the persistent left superior vena cava (<a href="../B9780702077050000811/B9780702077050000811_bib.xhtml#bib161" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_161">Liu et al 2019</a>). The left brachiocephalic vein sometimes projects above the manubrium (more frequently in childhood) and crosses the midline superior to the jugular notch, immediately anterior to the trachea. A left-sided superior vena cava may cause difficulties when placing a cardiac catheter, pacing or defibrillating electrodes because the angle between the left superior vena cava and the left subclavian vein is more acute than that normally found between the left subclavian and left brachiocephalic vein. Its calibre may also be smaller than that of the right. Even if insertion of a catheter into a left superior vena cava is possible, the angle at which the catheter enters the right atrium causes difficulty when attempting to place it into the right ventricle and pulmonary trunk; this generally leaves the catheter tip against the coronary sinus, making it difficult to obtain blood samples. In the majority of cases of persistent left superior venae cava, blood drains into the right atrium via the coronary sinus. When this does not happen, the coronary sinus is absent, and the persistent left superior vena cava drains directly into the right atrium. Cyanosis reflects a persistent right-to-left shunt and affected individuals have a higher risk for paradoxical embolism. Radiographically, there is a paramediastinal bulge anterior to the aortic arch. Electrocardiograms show a left P-wave axis. Diagnosis can be confirmed by cardiac catheterization and angiography. Persistent left superior vena cava may be associated with extracardiac conditions such as VACTERL association (vertebral defects, anal atresia, cardiac malformations, tracheo-oesophageal fistula with oesophageal atresia, radial and renal dysplasia, and limb anomalies); trisomy 21; 22q11; CHARGE association (coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, mental retardation, genital and ear anomalies); and 45 XO karyotype (Turner syndrome).</div><div class="text" id="p3580">If the superior vena cava is duplicated, the right superior vena cava may drain into the right atrium and the left superior vena cava into the left atrium.

At rest, pressure in a superficial vein is equal to the height of the column of blood extending from that vein to the heart. When the posterior leg muscles contract, blood is pumped proximally into the deep veins and is normally prevented from flowing into the superficial veins by the valves in the perforating veins. During muscular relaxation, blood is drawn into the deep veins from the superficial veins. If the valves in the perforating veins become incompetent, these veins become sites of ‘high-pressure leaks’ during muscular contraction, and the superficial veins become dilated and varicose.

Varicose veins have thin walls and ‘leak’ red blood cells into adjacent soft tissues. As these cells are broken down, haemosiderin is deposited in the soft tissues, resulting in a brown pigmentation.

In the sole, superficial veins form a plantar cutaneous arch across the roots of the toes and also drain into the medial and lateral marginal veins.</div></section><section><a id="s3490"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle2775">Long saphenous vein</h5><div class="textfl" id="p4070">The long (great) saphenous vein (see <a href="../B9780702077050000768/B9780702077050000768.xhtml#f0045">Fig. 76.9A</a>), the longest vein in the body, starts distally as a continuation of the medial marginal vein of the foot, and ends in the femoral vein a short distance distal to the inguinal ligament. It ascends immediately anterior to the medial malleolus, crosses the distal third of the medial surface of the tibia obliquely in an anteroposterior direction to reach its medial border, and then ascends a little behind the border to the knee. Proximally, it is posteromedial to the medial tibial and femoral condyles and then ascends the medial aspect of the thigh. It passes through the saphenous opening and finally opens into the femoral vein. The ‘centre’ of the opening is often said to be 2.5–3.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm inferolateral to the pubic tubercle, and the vein is then represented by a line drawn from this point to the adductor tubercle.

At the knee, the saphenous branch of the descending genicular artery (the saphenous artery) and, in the leg and foot, the saphenous nerve all lie anterior to the vein. The vein is often duplicated, especially distal to the knee. It has 10–20 valves, which are more numerous in the leg than in the thigh. One is present just before the vein pierces the cribriform fascia, another at its junction with the femoral vein. In almost its entire extent the vein lies in subcutaneous tissue, but it has many connections with the deep veins, especially in the leg.</div><div class="text" id="p4080">At the ankle, the long saphenous vein drains the sole of the foot by medial marginal veins. In the leg, it often connects with the short saphenous vein and with deep veins via perforating veins. Just distal to the knee it usually receives three large tributaries from the front of the leg, the medial malleolar region (connecting with some of the ‘perforating’ veins) and the calf (communicating with the short saphenous vein). The tributary draining the medial malleolar region is formed distally from a fine network or ‘corona’ of delicate veins just over the medial malleolus, and then ascends the medial aspect of the calf as the posterior arch vein. This vein was first illustrated by Leonardo da Vinci, whose name is sometimes given to it. It connects with posterior tibial venae comitantes by a series of perforating (communicating) veins. There are usually three, equally spaced between the medial malleolus and the mid-calf. More than three such perforators are uncommon, and an arch vein perforator above mid-calf is only very rarely found.</div><div class="text" id="p4085">Above the posterior crural arch vein, perforating veins join the long saphenous vein or one of its main tributaries at two main sites. The first is at a level in the upper calf indicated by its name, the tibial tubercle perforator; the second is in the lower/intermediate third of the thigh, where it perforates the deep fascia roof of the subsartorial canal to join the femoral vein.</div><div class="text" id="p4090">In the thigh, the long saphenous vein receives many tributaries. Some open independently, while others converge to form large named channels that frequently pass towards the basal half of the femoral triangle before joining the long saphenous near its termination. These may be grouped as follows: one or more large posteromedial tributaries, one or more large anterolateral tributaries, and four or more peri-inguinal veins. The posteromedial vein of the thigh, large and sometimes double, drains a large superficial region indicated by its name; it has (as have the other tributaries) radiological and surgical significance. One of its lower radicles is often continuous with the short saphenous vein. The posteromedial vein is sometimes named the accessory saphenous vein, though some restrict the term accessory to a lower (more distal) posteromedial tributary when two (or more) are present. Another large vessel, the anterolateral vein of the thigh (anterior femoral cutaneous vein), usually commences from an anterior network of veins in the distal thigh and crosses the apex and distal half of the femoral triangle to reach the long saphenous vein. As the latter traverses the saphenous opening, it is joined by the superficial epigastric, superficial circumflex iliac and superficial external pudendal veins. Their mode of union varies. Superficial epigastric and circumflex iliac veins drain the inferior abdominal wall, the latter also receiving tributaries from the proximolateral region of the thigh. The superficial epigastric or the femoral vein may connect with the lateral thoracic veins by means of a thoracoepigastric vein that runs superficially on the anterolateral aspect of the trunk. This vein connects the inferior and superior caval areas of drainage and may be dilated and visible in cases of inferior caval obstruction. Superficial external pudendal veins drain part of the scrotum/labia; one is joined by the superficial dorsal vein of the penis/clitoris. The deep external pudendal veins join the long saphenous vein at the saphenous opening.</div><div class="text" id="p4095">The long saphenous vein is often harvested for grafts used in both peripheral and coronary arterial surgery.</div></section><section><a id="s3495"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle2780">Short saphenous vein</h5><div class="textfl" id="p4100">The short saphenous vein (small saphenous vein) begins posterior to the lateral malleolus as a continuation of the lateral marginal vein (see <a href="../B9780702077050000768/B9780702077050000768.xhtml#f0045">Fig. 76.9B</a>). In the lower third of the calf, it ascends lateral to the calcaneal tendon, lying on the deep fascia and covered only by subcutaneous tissue and skin. Inclining medially to reach the midline of the calf, it penetrates the deep fascia, within which it ascends on gastrocnemius, only emerging between the deep fascia and gastrocnemius gradually at about the junction of the middle and proximal thirds of the calf (usually well below the lower limit of the popliteal fossa).

Sometimes a communicating branch ascends medially to the accessory saphenous vein: this may be the main continuation of the short saphenous vein. In the leg, the short saphenous vein lies near the sural nerve and contains 7–13 valves, with one near its termination. Its mode of termination is variable: it may join the long saphenous vein in the proximal thigh or it may bifurcate, one branch joining the long saphenous vein and the other joining the popliteal or deep posterior femoral veins.

Small isolated follicles also occur beneath the lingual mucosa. The lymphatic drainage of the tongue can be divided into three main regions: marginal, central and dorsal. The anterior region of the tongue drains into marginal and central vessels, and the posterior part of the tongue behind the circumvallate papillae drains into the dorsal lymph vessels.

Tumours of the subglottic larynx will often spread to the paratracheal lymph node chain prior to clinical presentation. The presenting symptoms are usually voice change and airway obstruction rather than a mass in the neck.

The dominant lymphatic drainage of the breast is derived from the dermal network (see <a href="../B9780702077050000537/B9780702077050000537.xhtml#f0090">Fig. 53.24</a>). Breast lymphatics branch extensively; the smallest valveless superficial lymph capillaries (20–70<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm diameter) drain into larger lymph pre-collecting vessels (∼300 μm diameter) that contain valves and smooth muscle. These pre-collectors unite to form a subcutaneous network between skin and breast tissue and drain almost always to at least one sentinel node, usually near the lateral border of pectoralis minor (<a href="../B9780702077050000811/B9780702077050000811_bib.xhtml#bib287" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_287">Suami et al 2008</a>). Lymphatic blockage through tumour occlusion may therefore result in reverse flow through the lymphatic channels, resulting in oedema. The direction of lymphatic flow within the breast parallels the major venous tributaries and enters the regional lymph nodes via an extensive periductal and perilobular network of lymphatic channels. Most of these lymphatics drain into the axillary group of regional lymph nodes either directly or through the retro-areolar lymphatic plexus (see <a href="../B9780702077050000495/B9780702077050000495_split_a.xhtml#f0205">Fig. 49.48</a>).

On the right, the lymphatics ultimately drain into the right subclavian vein near its junction with the internal jugular vein. Part of the medial sides of the breasts drain to the parasternal nodes, lying along the internal thoracic vessels. These may anastomose across the sternum, providing a route for contralateral nodal spread in medially located breast carcinoma. Parasternal nodes and vessels may drain inferiorly via the superior and inferior epigastric lymphatic routes to the superficial and deep inguinal nodes in the femoral triangle.</div><div class="text" id="p4300">Axillary nodes receive more than 75% of the lymph from the breast. There are 20–40 axillary nodes, grouped somewhat artificially as pectoral (anterior), subscapular (posterior), central and apical. Surgically, the nodes are described in relation to pectoralis minor; those lying lateral or inferior to pectoralis minor are the low nodes (level 1), those lying posterior to pectoralis minor are the middle group (level 2), and those lying between the upper border of pectoralis minor and the lower border of the clavicle are the upper or apical axillary nodes (level 3) (see <a href="../B9780702077050000537/B9780702077050000537.xhtml#f0090">Fig. 53.24</a>). There may be one or two interpectoral (Rotter’s) nodes lying between pectoralis minor and major. Efferent vessels may pass directly from the breast around the anterior axillary border and through the axillary fascia to the pectoral (anterior axillary) lymph nodes; some may pass directly to the subscapular (posterior axillary) nodes. A few vessels pass from the superior part of the breast to the apical axillary nodes, sometimes interrupted by the infraclavicular nodes or by small, inconstant, interpectoral nodes. Most of the remainder drain to parasternal nodes from the medial and lateral parts of the breast and accompany perforating branches of the internal thoracic artery. Lymphatic vessels occasionally follow lateral cutaneous branches of the posterior intercostal arteries to the intercostal nodes (see <a href="../B9780702077050000562/B9780702077050000562.xhtml#f0025">Fig. 56.4A</a>).</div><section><a id="s3685"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle2925">Axillary surgery in breast cancer</h6><div class="textfl" id="p4305">Axillary lymph node dissection may be performed for diagnostic and therapeutic reasons.

The developed lymphatic network of the heart traverses all its layers, including those of the atria and ventricles and extends to the mitral valve. Most lymph drainage of the pericardium is to the thoracic and the right lymphatic ducts; upper mediastinal (e.g. para-aortic, subaortic, retrotracheal, prevascular) and parasternal internal thoracic lymph nodal groups also receive efferents (see <a href="../B9780702077050000549/B9780702077050000549.xhtml#f0045">Fig. 54.12B</a>). There are two layers of pericardial lymphatic vessels, contacting and surrounding the parietal pericardium and also within the fat and loose areolar tissue. The anterior (sternocostal) part of the pericardium either drains laterally towards the phrenic nerves as they enter the respiratory diaphragm (superior phrenic nodes), or travels along the ventral border of the pericardium to enter the prepericardial lymph nodes located at the pericardio-diaphragmatic junction. Drainage from the lateral pericardium is more variable.

The walls of the alveoli and the alveolar ducts have no lymph vessels, these only start at the bronchioles. The superficial plexus lies deep to the visceral pleura; its efferents pass around the margins of the lung and its fissures, eventually reaching the bronchopulmonary (hilar) nodes (see <a href="../B9780702077050000549/B9780702077050000549.xhtml#f0045">Fig. 54.12</a>). The deep lymphatics originate at bronchiolar level and follow the bronchial tree divisions and pulmonary vessels to the hilum, ending in the same nodes as the superficial plexus. In larger bronchi, the deep plexus has submucosal and peribronchial parts, but in smaller bronchi there is only a single plexus that extends to the bronchioles. Lymph node groups (stations) sit alongside the bronchi and are classified according to their location, specifically; subsegmental, segmental, lobar and hilar (<a href="../B9780702077050000811/B9780702077050000811_bib.xhtml#bib263" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_263">Rusch et al 2009</a>).

There is a tendency for vessels from the superior lobes to pass to the superior tracheobronchial (lower paratracheal) nodes, and those from the inferior lobes to pass to the inferior tracheobronchial (subcarinal) group. However, lymphatic vessels of adjoining lobes connect deep in the fissures and so these connections are not exclusive. At the level of pulmonary lobation, the arrangement of lymphatic vessels follows the central artery of a lobule and its peripheral veins.

Lymph vessels in the perineum and lower part of the labia majora drain primarily to inguinal nodes.</div><div class="text" id="p4600">Vaginal lymphatic vessels link with those of the cervix, rectum and vulva. They form three groups but the regions drained are not sharply demarcated. Upper vessels accompany the uterine artery to the internal and external iliac nodes; intermediate vessels accompany the vaginal artery to the internal iliac nodes; and vessels draining the vagina below the hymen, and from the vulva and perineal skin, pass to the superficial inguinal nodes.</div></section><section><a id="s3880"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle3095">External genitalia: male</h5><div class="textfl" id="p4605">The penile and perineal skin is drained by lymphatic vessels that accompany the external pudendal veins to the superficial inguinal nodes. Lymphatics from the glans penis pass to the deep inguinal and external iliac nodes, and those from the erectile tissue and spongy urethra pass to the internal iliac nodes. Scrotal lymphatics do not cross the raphe of the scrotum and therefore lymphatic drainage from the scrotum is always routed to the ipsilateral superficial inguinal nodes.</div><div class="text" id="p4610">Testicular lymphatic flow is abundant and consistent and follows the general retroperitoneal scheme of vertical drainage, with lateral flow from right to left. Lymphatic vessels from the right testis drain primarily into the right lateral aortic and lateral caval nodes, with some drainage into the left lateral aortic nodes. Lymphatic vessels from the left testis drain into the left and right lateral aortic and lateral caval nodes.</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s3885"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle3100">Lymphatic Drainage of the Vertebral Column</h2><div class="textfl" id="p4615">Little is known in detail about the lymphatic drainage of the vertebral column and its associated soft tissues. In general, deep lymphatic vessels tend to follow the arteries. The cervical vertebral column drains to deep cervical nodes, the thoracic to (posterior) intercostal nodes and the lumbar column to lateral aortic and retro-aortic nodes. The pelvic part of the column drains to lateral sacral and internal iliac nodes.</div></section><section><a id="s3890"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle3105">Lymphatic Drainage of the Limbs</h2><div class="textfl" id="p4620">The subcutaneous tissues of the upper and lower limbs can be divided into five layers: skin (layer 1); subcutaneous fat (2); superficial fascia (3); loose areolar tissue (4); and deep fascia (5). Layer 2 can be subdivided into a superficial (2a) and deep layer (2c) by a thin transparent horizontal septum (2b) (<a href="../B9780702077050000811/B9780702077050000811_bib.xhtml#bib303" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_303">Tourani et al 2014</a>). The main superficial veins and the superficial nerves are found in layer 4 and the lymphatic collectors in layer 2c and layer 4.</div><section><a id="s3895"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle3110">Upper limb</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle3115">Superficial tissues</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s3900"/><div class="textfl" id="p4625">Superficial lymphatic vessels begin in cutaneous plexuses: in the hand, the palmar plexus is denser than the dorsal plexus. Digital plexuses drain along the digital borders to their webs, where they join the distal palmar vessels, which pass back to the dorsal aspect of the hand. The proximal palm drains towards the carpus, medially by vessels that run along its ulnar border, and laterally to join vessels draining the thumb. Several vessels from the central palmar plexus form a trunk that winds round the second metacarpal bone to join the dorsal vessels that drain the index finger and thumb.</div><div class="text" id="p4630">In the forearm and arm, superficial vessels run with the superficial veins. Collecting vessels from the hand pass into the forearm on all carpal aspects. Dorsal vessels, after running proximally in parallel, curve successively round the borders of the limb to join the ventral vessels. Anterior carpal vessels run through the forearm parallel with the median vein of the forearm to the cubital region, then follow the medial border of biceps brachii before piercing the deep fascia at the anterior axillary fold to end in the lateral axillary lymph nodes.</div><div class="text" id="p4635">Lymph vessels that lie laterally in the forearm receive vessels that curve round the lateral border from the dorsal aspect of the limb. They follow the cephalic vein to the level of the tendon of deltoid, where most incline medially to reach the lateral axillary nodes; a few continue with the vein and drain into the infraclavicular nodes. Vessels lying medially in the forearm are joined by vessels that curve round the medial border of the limb and follow the basilic vein. Proximal to the elbow, some end in supratrochlear lymph nodes whose efferents, together with the medial vessels that have bypassed them, pierce the deep fascia with the basilic vein and end in the lateral axillary nodes or deep lymphatic vessels.</div><div class="text" id="p4640">Collecting vessels from the deltoid region pass round the anterior and posterior axillary folds to end in the axillary nodes. The scapular skin drains either to subscapular axillary nodes or by channels that follow the transverse cervical vessels to the inferior deep cervical nodes.</div></section><section><a id="s3905"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle3120">Deeper tissues</h4><div class="textfl" id="p4645">Deep lymph vessels follow the main neurovascular bundles (radial, ulnar, interosseous and brachial) to the lateral axillary nodes. They are less numerous than the superficial vessels and communicate with them at intervals. A few lymph nodes occur along the vessels. Scapular muscles drain mainly to the subscapular axillary nodes, and pectoral muscles drain mainly to the pectoral, central and apical nodes.</div><div class="text" id="p4650">One or two supratrochlear nodes are superficial to the deep fascia proximal to the medial epicondyle and medial to the basilic vein; their efferents accompany the vein to join the deep lymph vessels. Small, isolated nodes sometimes occur along the radial, ulnar and interosseous vessels, in the cubital fossa near the bifurcation of the brachial artery, or in the arm medial to the brachial vessels.</div></section></section><section><a id="s3910"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle3125">Lower limb</h3><div class="textfl" id="p4655">Most lymph from the lower limb traverses a large intermediary inguinal group of nodes (see <a href="../B9780702077050000768/B9780702077050000768.xhtml#f0050">Fig. 76.10</a>). Peripheral nodes are few and are all deeply sited in the popliteal fossa except for an inconsistent node lying proximally on the interosseous membrane near the anterior tibial vessels. Enlarged popliteal nodes, often as a result of inflammation, malignancy or injury to the lateral side of the foot, may be palpated along the line of the popliteal vessels while the passively supported knee is gradually moved from extension to semi-flexion. Inguinal lymph nodes are found superficial and deep to the deep fascia. The superficial nodes may be divided into a lower vertical group that clothe the proximal part of the long saphenous vein, and an upper group that lie parallel to, but below, the inguinal ligament and which are related laterally to the superficial circumflex iliac and medially to the superficial external pudendal vessels. The deep nodes are few and lie alongside the medial aspect of the femoral vein. Lymph from the lower limb passes from the inguinal lymph nodes to the external and common iliac nodes, and ultimately drains to the lateral aortic nodes. Deep gluteal lymph reaches the same group through the internal and common iliac lymphatic vessels.</div><section><a id="s3915"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle3130">Superficial tissues</h4><div class="textfl" id="p4660">The superficial lymph vessels begin in subcutaneous plexuses. Collecting vessels leave the foot either medially with the long saphenous vein, or laterally with the short saphenous vein. Medial vessels are larger and more numerous. They start on the medial side of the dorsum of the foot, ascend anterior or posterior to the medial malleolus, accompany the long saphenous vein and drain to the distal superficial inguinal nodes. Lateral vessels begin on the fibular side of the dorsum of the foot. Some cross anteromedially in the leg to join the medial vessels and so pass to the distal superficial inguinal lymph nodes, while others accompany the short saphenous vein and drain to the popliteal nodes. Superficial lymph vessels from the gluteal region run anteriorly to the proximal superficial inguinal nodes.</div></section><section><a id="s3920"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle3135">Deeper tissues</h4><div class="textfl" id="p4665">The deep lymph vessels accompany the anterior and posterior tibial, fibular, popliteal and femoral vessels. Popliteal nodes interrupt the deep vessels from the foot and leg; deep vessels from the thigh pass to the deep inguinal nodes. The deep lymphatic vessels of the gluteal region follow their corresponding blood vessels. Those accompanying the superior gluteal vessels end in a node near the intrapelvic part of the superior gluteal artery, adjacent to the superior border of the greater sciatic foramen, while those that follow the inferior gluteal vessels traverse one or two of the small nodes inferior to piriformis and then pass to the internal iliac nodes.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1.464E126" id="pagebreak_1.464E126"/><a id="pg1464.e124"/></div></section></section></section></body></html>
