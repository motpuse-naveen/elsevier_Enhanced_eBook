The blood supply, lymphatics and nerve supply travel within a mesentery; the jejunal mesentery is shorter than the ileal mesentery. While there is no clear distinction between the jejunum and the ileum along its length, there is a gradual change in morphology from the proximal to distal ends of the small bowel. The intestinal wall is composed of mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa and serosa. The mucosal surface is covered in intestinal villi with intervening crypts. Enterocytes are the most numerous type of cell in the small intestinal mucosa, and are responsible for nutrient, electrolyte and fluid absorption. Enterocytes hold up to 3000 microvilli on their surface, increasing the absorptive surface area eight-fold. At the base of the crypts are the intestinal stem cells, which are the source of most of the cell types of the intestinal epithelium.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">anatomy; blood supply; Cajal; duodenum; ileum; innervation; jejunum; lymphatics; nutrition support; physiology; stem cells; stoma</div></section>--><section><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Overview</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The small intestine consists of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. It extends from the pylorus to the ileocaecal junction and has a mean length of 5 metres (3–8.5 metres) when measured intraoperatively in adults (<a href="#bib55" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_55">Teitelbaum et al 2013</a>). The duodenum extends from the stomach to the duodenojejunal junction, marked by the suspensory ligament of the duodenum (ligament of Treitz). There is no clear boundary between the jejunum and ileum, but there is a gradual transition in morphology from the proximal to distal ends of the small intestine. The distal 30<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm or so of the ileum is often referred to as the terminal ileum: it has some specialized physiological functions.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">The duodenum is in the proximal abdomen and is mostly retroperitoneal. The jejunum and ileum occupy the central and distal parts of the abdominal cavity and usually lie within the boundary formed by the colon. The small intestine is attached to the anterior wall of the retroperitoneum by a mesentery that allows the intestinal loops to be relatively mobile. In the supine position, loops of jejunum can be found anterior to the transverse colon, stomach and lesser omentum, whereas in the erect position, loops of ileum can descend into the pelvis anterior to the rectum. The greater omentum covers the proximal jejunum and ileum to a variable extent. The jejunum and ileum are covered by visceral peritoneum on all but their mesenteric borders, where the peritoneum is reflected to enclose the adipose tissue of the mesentery. The small intestine mesentery abuts about 20% of the circumference of the muscular wall of the ileum and somewhat less of the jejunum.</div></section><section><a id="s0015"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0025">Duodenum</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0020">The adult duodenum is approximately 25<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm long and is the shortest, widest and most predictably located part of the small intestine.

The inferior ‘limb’ of the C extends further to the left of the midline than the superior limb. The head of the pancreas lies within the concavity of the duodenum, which is ‘draped’ over the prominence formed by the lumbar spine; the duodenum therefore curves in an anteroposterior direction as well as forming a ‘C’ shape. The duodenum lies entirely proximal to the level of the umbilicus.

Beyond the duodenal bulb, the internal appearance is characterized by circular folds of mucosa that remain pronounced, even during endoscopic insufflation (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 64.2</span></a>). During contrast radiology, the duodenal bulb shows a few longitudinal folds continuous with the pylorus (<a href="#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_38">Mather Cordiner and Calthrop 1936</a>) and appears triangular; it is often visible on plain radiographs of the abdomen as an isolated air shadow to the right of the first or second lumbar vertebra. The superior part of the duodenum passes superiorly, posteriorly and laterally before curving sharply inferiorly at the superior duodenal flexure. This portion transitions to a retroperitoneal position where peritoneum only covers its anterior aspect.

They can be visualized using endoscopic ultrasound and sampled using a fine needle under endoscopic ultrasound guidance. The nodes are important in the staging of gastric, pancreatic or bile duct tumours, or identifying metastases from other solid tumours of the abdominal cavity.

The descending part of the duodenum is covered by peritoneum only on its proximal anterior surface. It lies posterior to the gallbladder and the right lobe of the liver at its start and is crossed anteriorly by the transverse colon. The right end of the gastrocolic ligament and the origin of the transverse mesocolon are attached to the anterior surface of the duodenum by loose connective tissue. The connective tissue and vessels forming the mesentery of the superior aspect of the ascending colon and right colic flexure are loosely attached to its anterior surface, inferior to the attachment of the transverse mesocolon.

The head of the pancreas and the bile duct are medial and the right colic flexure is cephalad and lateral. Part of the head of the pancreas is sometimes embedded in the medial duodenal wall, and pancreatic ‘rests’ in the duodenal wall can produce small filling defects on contrast radiology. The internal appearance is similar to that of the distal portion of the superior part of the duodenum, with pronounced mucosal folds (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 64.3</span></a>). The bile duct and pancreatic duct (of Wirsung) enter the medial wall, where they usually unite to form a common channel, which frequently contains a dilated segment known as the hepatopancreatic ampulla (of Vater) (<a href="../B9780702077050000689/B9780702077050000689.xhtml">Ch. 68</a>).

They are typically located on the medial wall of the descending part of the duodenum, intimately related to the head of the pancreas: the major duodenal papilla is frequently found either on the mucosal fold at the mouth of a diverticulum or arising from the mucosa within it. Diverticula can complicate the interpretation of contrast radiographs of the duodenum or biliary system, and can cause difficulties during attempted endoscopic cannulation of the major duodenal papilla. Most are asymptomatic but they can be complicated by bleeding, inflammation, perforation and, occasionally, pancreatitis or biliary complications (<a href="#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_19">Fotiades et al 2005</a>).</div><section><a id="s0035"/><section><a id="s0040"/><h5 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0045">Kocher manoeuvre to expose the posterior aspect of the head of the pancreas</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0065">The Kocher manoeuvre is used to expose retroperitoneal structures, such as an injury to the inferior vena cava, or the hilum of the kidney or the head of the pancreas, especially as an early step in a pancreaticoduodenectomy operation.

Jejunal feeds can be delivered via a nasojejunal or gastrojejunal tube or directly into the jejunum; gastrojejunal and jejunal tubes can be inserted endoscopically, radiologically or surgically.

The jejunal mesentery, measured from the superior mesenteric artery to the mesenteric border of the intestine, is shorter than the ileal mesentery, and the jejunal arteries are slightly larger than their ileal counterparts. The jejunum typically contains 1–3 tiers of vascular arcades, whereas there are often 2–6 tiers in the ileum (<a href="#f0045"><span class="bold">Fig. 64.10</span></a>). The straight arteries (vasa recta) in the ileum are more numerous, shorter and narrower than in the jejunum.

The lumen of the diverticulum usually has a calibre similar to that of the ileum.

The mucosa is typically ileal, but small heterotopic areas of gastric body type epithelium, pancreatic, colonic or other tissues can also occur in the wall of a diverticulum. Unopposed acid secretion by heterotopic gastric body type epithelium can cause ulceration and bleeding in the adjacent normal ileal mucosa. Diverticular inflammation can mimic acute appendicitis: because the congenital ileal diverticulum and the appendix are both derived from the midgut, pain from either structure is referred to the periumbilical region.

In animal models, lymphatic drainage is re-established within 21–28 days, which is consistent with observations in patients (<a href="#bib35" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_35">Kocandrle et al 1966</a>).</div></section></section></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0215"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0155">Vascular supply and lymphatic drainage</h3><section><a id="s0220"/><section><a id="s0225"/><h4 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0160">Arteries</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0275">Branches from the superior mesenteric artery supply the jejunum and ileum. The arteries divide as they approach the mesenteric border of the intestine (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 64.5</a>), giving off numerous branches that extend between the muscular layers before forming a submucosal arterial plexus that supplies the mucosa. Although there is a rich anastomotic network of arteries within the intestinal mesentery, there are few anastomoses between the terminal branches close to the intestinal wall. The intramural and submucosal arterial networks consist of small-calibre vessels only. Consequently, division or occlusion of several consecutive straight arteries can produce segmental ischaemia of the intestine, while division of more proximal arterial branches in the small intestine mesentery might not cause ischaemia because of collateral flow through vascular arcades.</div><section><a id="s0230"/><h5 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0165">Superior mesenteric artery</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0280">The superior mesenteric artery originates from the abdominal aorta 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm inferior to the coeliac trunk, at the level of the inferior border of the first lumbar vertebra in the transpyloric plane (<a href="#f0050"><span class="bold">Figs 64.13</span></a><span class="bold">–</span><a href="#f0060"><span class="bold">64.15</span></a>).

Among the major branches of the descending aorta, the superior mesenteric artery typically has the most acute take-off angle. The result is less turbulent flow, which makes embolic events more likely than in the other visceral arterial branches of the abdominal aorta. The acuteness of the angle between the aorta and superior mesenteric artery can make intravascular cannulation via the transfemoral route somewhat difficult. The artery is usually surrounded by fat, lymphatics and neural tissue at its origin, which helps to increase the angle and the distance between it and the aorta, thereby preventing compression of the duodenum where it is crossed by the artery. The artery descends anterior to the uncinate process of the pancreas and the horizontal part of the duodenum and posterior to the splenic vein and the body of the pancreas. The left renal vein lies posterior to it and separates it from the aorta (see <a href="#f0060">Fig. 64.15B</a>). Within the small intestine mesentery, the superior mesenteric artery crosses anterior to the inferior vena cava, right ureter and right psoas major. Its calibre progressively decreases as successive branches are given off to the jejunum and ileum, and its terminal branch anastomoses with the termination of the ileocolic artery.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0050"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000641/main.assets/f64-09-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0050"/><a id="fspara0050"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 64.13</span> The superior mesenteric artery and its branches.

First, lacteals from the villi drain into a plexus of lymphatics in the submucosa and are joined by vessels from lymph spaces at the bases of solitary lymphoid follicles; these lymphatic vessels have few if any valves. Second, a coarse plexus of lymphatics also runs in the muscularis externa between the two muscle layers. The submucosal and muscular networks share few connections but both communicate freely with larger valved collecting lymphatics at the mesenteric border of the small intestine (<a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">Miller et al 2010</a>). Mesenteric lymphatics pass between the layers of the mesentery and drain via a series of mesenteric nodes concentrated around the regional mesenteric vessels. Individual segments of small intestine have a relatively wide field of lymphatic drainage, which makes radical surgical resection of draining lymph nodes difficult if the blood supply to the remaining unaffected small intestine is to be preserved.

In healthy adults, the gastrointestinal tract is capable of secreting 8–10 litres of fluid per day in addition to the 1.5–2 litres ingested each day. To reduce this volume to the typical ileocaecal daily flow of approximately 2 litres per day, the small intestinal epithelium has a large number of transport molecules and regulatory proteins. Net fluid movement across the gastrointestinal epithelium is primarily the result of the active transport of sodium, chloride and bicarbonate ions. The jejunum can only absorb sodium across a small sodium gradient and therefore does not normally absorb salt and water, but secretes it into the lumen. Most fluid and electrolyte absorption occurs in the ileum, which is able to absorb across a larger sodium gradient (<a href="#bib43" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_43">Nightingale and Spiller 2001</a>): proximal small intestine fistulae or surgical jejunostomies therefore have a higher volume output with greater electrolyte losses than more distal stomata.</div></section><section><a id="s0315"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0245">Nutrients</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0395">The mucosal brush border has an abundance of enzymes and pumps on its surface. Examples include the sodium-dependent glucose transporter protein (SGLT1) and the fructose transporter protein (GLUT5). Oligosaccharides are broken down to monosaccharides by enzymes at the brush border of the small intestine before being transported across the mucosa. A deficiency of lactase on the mucosal brush border is relatively common and results in lactose intolerance. Proteins are broken down into single amino acids and small peptides. The peptidase gradient across the microvillus brush border increases along the length of the small intestine, suggesting that amino acids are absorbed more distally than carbohydrates. Dietary fats are emulsified by biliary secretions and then broken down by pancreatic lipase into free fatty acids and phospholipids, which form micelles. The lipid components are then absorbed within the distal small intestine and converted into chylomicrons in the enterocytes before being secreted into the lymphatic system. Minerals such as calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and iron, and the water- and fat-soluble vitamins, are predominantly absorbed in the duodenum and proximal jejunum (<a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Farrell 2002</a>, <a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">Malik and Westergaard 2002</a>). Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed in the terminal ileum after binding to intrinsic factor released by gastric parietal cells. Bile is largely composed of bile acid salts conjugated to taurine or glycine. These salts are deconjugated by bacteria in the ileum to either a free acid or a secondary bile acid. The free acids are reabsorbed by passive transport in the jejunum and ileum. The terminal ileum has an active sodium cotransporter that scavenges conjugated bile acids. Reabsorbed bile acids enter the portal circulation and are returned to the liver for re-secretion.</div></section><section><a id="s0320"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0250">Motility</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0405">The motility of the small intestine differs depending on whether the individual is fasting or postprandial. In the fasting state, the smooth muscle of the small intestine exhibits cyclical myoelectrical activity, the so-called migrating motor complex (MMC). The frequency of these slow waves is regulated by interstitial cells of Cajal and is about 11/minute in the jejunum, decreasing along the length of the small intestine to 7–8/minute in the ileum (<a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_26">Husebye 1999</a>). When slow waves are amplified beyond a threshold by neural, endocrine or paracrine stimulation, action potentials are generated, resulting in smooth muscle contraction. This spreads circumferentially at first and then propagates along the entire circumference of the intestine in an aboral direction, causing a ring-like contraction of the circular smooth muscle that progresses distally along the small intestine (about 10% of contractions reaching the ileum).</div><div class="text" id="p0410">The MMC consists of three phases: phase I is a period of quiescence, phase II is composed of irregular contractions and phase III is a short burst of phasic contractions at the maximum frequency of the slow waves for that part of the intestine. The velocity of migration is 5–10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm/minute in the jejunum, decreasing gradually along the small intestine to about 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm/minute in the ileum. The MMC requires an intact enteric nervous system and does not depend on extrinsic innervation. Consequently, MMCs are present in transplanted (denervated) small intestine. However, there is evidence that extrinsic innervation modulates the MMC. For example, sleep causes the almost complete disappearance of phase II. Phase III activity normally recovers in the proximal small intestine within a few hours of major abdominal surgery, although the pressure wave amplitude is temporarily reduced. Somatostatin and opioids decrease phase II activity. After a meal, the cyclical fasting activity is abolished for several hours and replaced by irregular contractions that consist of both segmental ‘stationary’ contractions and propulsive contractions (<a href="#bib4" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_4">Barnert 2007</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0415">Assessment of small intestine motility can complement detailed microscopic examination of full-thickness biopsy specimens of the intestine when conditions associated with intestinal dysmotility are characterized, helping to distinguish intestinal neuropathy from visceral myopathy. Wireless motility capsules are also finding increasing use. These devices are pill-shaped and can be either swallowed or placed into the stomach with an endoscope. Sensors for pH, pressure and temperature record measurements and send these wirelessly to an external recording device.

The lateral plasma membranes of enterocytes are highly folded and interdigitate to form complex intercellular boundaries that are anchored periodically by desmosomes and that make contact at gap junctions.
