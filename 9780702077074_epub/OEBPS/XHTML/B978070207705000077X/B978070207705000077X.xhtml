The anatomy of the bony pelvis must be known for the proper assessment of a pregnant woman as its variations can affect delivery. The pelvic region bridges between the vertebral column and thigh, and serves to transmit major vessels and nerves of the lower limb and to guarantee lower limb stability for coordinated movement and gait. The chapter also describes the osteology of the pelvis and femur, and the arthrology of the hip joint. Factors that contribute to the mechanical stability and forces across the hip joints while walking and standing are also described. The regional superficial soft tissues as well as attachments, relations, vascular supply, innervation and actions of all muscles in the iliac and gluteal regions, and anterior, adductor and posterior compartments of the thigh are discussed. This is followed by a description of the femoral vessels. A particular emphasis is given to the arterial anastomoses around the hip. The cutaneous innervation of the region as well as the deeper neural components (femoral, obturator and sciatic nerves and their branches) is discussed.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">acetabulum; active movements of the hip; coxal bone; femur; forces on the femoral head; gluteal region; hip joint; hip; iliac; ischium; ligaments of the hip; pelvis; pubis; sacroiliac; sciatic; thigh</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The pelvic girdle consists of the paired hip bones (each composed of the ilium, ischium and pubis) and the sacrum. The two pubic bones articulate anteriorly at the pubic symphysis and the sacrum articulates posteriorly with the two iliac bones at the sacroiliac joint; the bones are virtually incapable of independent movement, except in the female during parturition or because of pathological change. The pelvic girdle serves as a weight-bearing and protective structure, as an attachment for trunk and lower limb muscles, and as the skeletal framework of a birth canal capable of accommodating the passage of a fetus.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">The hip joint is a large synovial ball-and-socket type articulation between the head of the femur and the cup-shaped acetabulum. It permits extensive movements between the thigh and the pelvis, and between the trunk-and-pelvis (as a functional unit) and the thigh. The pivotal location of the hips serves as an essential mechanical link for many movements and postures of the body, including upright standing, locomotion, and bending toward and away from the ground.</div><div class="text" id="p0020">The gluteal region or buttock is an area demarcated by the gluteal fold inferiorly, a line joining the greater trochanter and the anterior superior iliac spine laterally, the iliac crest superiorly and the midline medially. It contains a large bulk of skeletal muscle that covers several vulnerable neurovascular structures, and incorporates junctional zones between the lower limb, pelvis and perineum at the sciatic foramina. Direct and indirect musculoskeletal injuries in this region may damage the sciatic nerve and gluteal vessels.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">The thigh consists of a cylinder of compact bone, the femoral shaft, surrounded by muscle groups traversed by important neurovascular structures. The muscles are grouped according to function and lie within three osteofascial compartments (anterior, posterior and medial) that are defined by fascial septa running between the femur and an enveloping tube of thick fascia, the fascia lata. The femoral artery gives off its major branch, the profunda femoris artery (deep artery of the thigh), in the anterior compartment. The sciatic nerve usually divides into its main branches, the tibial and common fibular nerves, as it passes through the posterior compartment of the thigh. The femoral nerve divides soon after entering the anterior compartment of the thigh beneath the inguinal ligament; the obturator nerve enters the medial thigh proximally and medially from the pelvis and divides into its main branches, which run anterior and posterior to adductor brevis.</div></section><a id="s0010"/><hgroup><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Skin and Soft Tissues</h2><h3 class="h2after1" id="cesectitle0025">Skin</h3></hgroup><section><a id="s0015"/><div class="textfl" id="p0030">See also <a href="../B9780702077050000781/B9780702077050000781.xhtml#c0078">Chapter 78</a>.</div><section><a id="s0020"/><hgroup><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0030">Cutaneous vascular supply and lymphatic drainage</h4><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0035">Buttock</h5></hgroup><section><a id="s0025"/><div class="textfl" id="p0035">Most of the skin of the buttock is supplied by musculocutaneous perforating vessels from the superior and inferior gluteal arteries.

In some regions, particularly near the inguinal ligament, it splits into recognizable layers, between which may be found the branches of superficial vessels and nerves. It is thick in the inguinal region, where its two layers enclose the superficial inguinal lymph nodes, long saphenous vein and other smaller vessels. Here, the superficial layer is continuous with that of the abdominal fascia. The deep layer, a thin fibroelastic stratum, is most marked medial to the long saphenous vein and inferior to the inguinal ligament, and is interposed between the subcutaneous vessels and nerves and the deep fascia, fusing with the latter a little below the ligament. This membranous layer of subcutaneous tissue overlies the saphenous opening, blending with its circumference and with the femoral sheath. Over the opening, it is perforated by the long saphenous vein, by the superficial branches of the femoral artery other than the superficial circumflex iliac branch (which perforates the fascia lata separately), and lymphatic vessels; hence the term cribriform fascia. The subcutaneous tissue of the buttock is continuous superiorly with that over the low back and contains a variable quantity of fat.</div></section><section><a id="s0055"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0060">Deep fascia</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0065">The deep fascia (fascia musculorum) covering the gluteal muscles varies in thickness. Over gluteus maximus it is thin, but over the anterior two-thirds of gluteus medius it forms the thick, strong gluteal aponeurosis. This is attached to the lateral border of the iliac crest superiorly, and splits anteriorly to enclose tensor fasciae latae and posteriorly to enclose gluteus maximus.</div><section><a id="s0060"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0065">Fascia lata</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0070">The fascia lata, the expansive deep fascia that surrounds the thigh, is thicker in the proximal and lateral parts of the thigh where tensor fasciae latae and an expansion from gluteus maximus are attached to it. It is thin posteriorly and over the adductor muscles, but thicker around the knee, where it is strengthened by expansions from the tendon of biceps femoris laterally, sartorius medially and quadriceps femoris anteriorly. The fascia lata is attached superiorly and posteriorly to the back of the sacrum and coccyx, laterally to the outer margin of the iliac crest, anteriorly to the inguinal ligament, the iliac fascia and superior ramus of the pubis, and medially to the inferior ramus of the pubis, the ramus and tuberosity of the ischium, and the lower border of the sacrotuberous ligament. From the iliac crest, it descends as a dense layer over gluteus medius to the upper border of gluteus maximus, where it splits into two layers, one passing superficial and the other deep to the muscle, the layers reuniting at the lower border of the muscle.</div><section><a id="s0065"/><p class="h6hd" id="cesectitle0070">Iliotibial tract</p><div class="textfl" id="p0075">Over the flattened lateral surface of the thigh the fascia lata thickens to form a strong band, the iliotibial tract. The upper end of the tract splits into two layers, where it encloses and anchors tensor fasciae latae and receives, posteriorly, most of the tendon of gluteus maximus. The superficial layer ascends lateral to tensor fasciae latae to the iliac crest; the deeper layer passes up and medially, deep to the muscle, and blends <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1353" id="pagebreak_1353"/><a id="pg1353"/>with the lateral part of the capsule of the hip joint. Distally the iliotibial tract is attached to a smooth, triangular facet (Gerdy’s tubercle) on the anterolateral aspect of the lateral condyle of the tibia, where it is superficial to, and blends with, an aponeurotic expansion from vastus lateralis. When the knee is extended against resistance, it stands out as a strong, visible ridge on the anterolateral aspect of the thigh and knee.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">Distally the fascia lata is attached to all exposed bony points around the knee joint, such as the condyles of the femur and tibia, and the head of the fibula. On each side of the patella the deep fascia is reinforced by transverse fibres, which receive contributions from the lateral and medial vasti. The stronger lateral fibres are continuous with the iliotibial tract.</div></section><section><a id="s0070"/><p class="h6hd" id="cesectitle0075">Intermuscular septa</p><div class="textfl" id="p0085">The deep surface of the fascia lata yields two intermuscular septa, which are attached to the whole of the linea aspera of the posterior femur and to its proximal and distal prolongations. The lateral septum, thicker and stronger than the medial one, extends from the attachment of gluteus maximus to the lateral femoral condyle; it lies between vastus lateralis in front and the short head of biceps femoris behind, and provides partial attachment for them. The medial, thinner and weaker septum lies between vastus medialis and the adductors and pectineus. Numerous smaller septa, such as that separating the thigh adductors and flexors, pass between the individual muscles, ensheathing them and sometimes providing partial attachment for their fibres.</div></section><section><a id="s0075"/><p class="h6hd" id="cesectitle0080">Saphenous opening</p><div class="textfl" id="p0090">The saphenous opening is an aperture in the deep fascia, inferolateral to the medial end of the inguinal ligament, which allows passage for the long saphenous vein and other smaller vessels (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 77.1</span></a>). The cribriform fascia, which is pierced by these structures, fills in the aperture and must be removed to reveal it. Adjacent subsidiary openings may exist to transmit venous tributaries. In the adult, the approximate centre of the saphenous opening is 3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm lateral to a point just distal to the pubic tubercle. The length and width of the opening vary considerably. The fascia lata in this part of the thigh displays superficial and deep strata (not to be confused with the superficial and deep layers of the subcutaneous tissue described above). They lie, respectively, anterior and posterior to the femoral sheath, with the saphenous opening situated where the two layers are in continuity. This serves to explain the somewhat oblique and spiral configuration of the saphenous opening.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000077X/main.assets/f77-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 77.1</span> The saphenous opening following removal of the cribriform fascia. <br/><span class="figcredit">Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy © Elsevier GmbH, Urban &amp; Fischer, Munich.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0095">The superficial layer, lateral and superior to the saphenous opening, is attached, in continuity, to the crest and anterior superior spine of the ilium, to the whole length of the inguinal ligament, and to the pecten pubis and lacunar ligament. It is reflected inferolaterally from the pubic tubercle as the arched falciform margin, which forms the superior, lateral and inferior boundaries of the saphenous opening; this margin adheres to the anterior layer of the femoral sheath, and the cribriform fascia is attached to it. The falciform margin is considered to have superior and inferior horns. The inferior horn is well defined, and is continuous behind the long saphenous vein with the deep stratum of the fascia lata.</div><div class="text" id="p0100">The deep layer is medial to the saphenous opening and is continuous with the superficial stratum at its lower margin.

It is wider proximally and its tapered distal end fuses with the vascular adventitia 3 or 4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm distal to the inguinal ligament. At birth the sheath is shorter; it elongates when extension at the hips becomes habitual. The femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve perforates its lateral wall. The medial wall slopes laterally and is pierced by the long saphenous vein and lymphatic vessels. Like the carotid sheath, the femoral sheath encloses a mass of connective tissue in which the vessels are embedded. Three compartments are described: a lateral compartment containing the femoral artery; an intermediate one for the femoral vein; and a medial compartment, the femoral canal, which contains lymph vessels and an occasional lymph node embedded in areolar tissue. The presence of this canal allows the femoral vein to distend. The canal is conical and approximately 1.25<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm in length. Its proximal (wider) end, termed the femoral ring, is bounded in front by the inguinal ligament, behind by pectineus and its fascia and the pectineal ligament, medially by the crescentic, lateral edge of the lacunar ligament and laterally by the femoral vein. The spermatic cord, or the round ligament of the uterus, is just above its anterior margin, while the inferior epigastric vessels are near its anterolateral rim. It is larger in women than in men: this is due partly to the relatively greater width of the female pelvis and partly to the smaller size of the femoral vessels in women. The ring is filled by condensed extraperitoneal tissue, the femoral septum, which is covered on its proximal aspect by the parietal peritoneum. Numerous lymph vessels that connect the deep inguinal to the external iliac lymph nodes traverse the femoral septum (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0165"><span class="bold">Fig. 77.2</span></a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0110"><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0165"><!--<img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000077X/main.assets/f77-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/>--><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0170"/><a id="fspara0165"/><!--<span class="fignum">Fig. 77.2</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, Structures passing beneath the inguinal ligament.<a id="fspara61535"/>(B, <span class="italic">continued online</span>) <br/><span class="figcredit">Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy © Elsevier GmbH, Urban &amp; Fischer, Munich.</span>--></figcaption></figure></div></div><div id="p0115"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0170"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000077X/main.assets/on77-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0175"/><a id="fspara0175"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 77.2</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, Structures passing beneath the inguinal ligament. <span class="bold">B</span>, An oblique multiplanar reformat of a CT with intravenous contrast medium along the inguinal ligament.

It is thin above but thickens progressively towards the inguinal ligament. The part covering psoas is thickened above as the medial arcuate ligament. Medially the fascia over psoas is attached by a series of fibrous arches to the intervertebral discs, the margins of vertebral bodies and the upper part of the sacrum. Laterally, it blends with the fascia anterior to quadratus lumborum above the iliac crest, and with the fascia covering iliacus below the crest. The iliac part is connected laterally to the whole of the inner lip of the iliac crest and medially to the pelvic brim, where it blends with the periosteum. At approximately the height of the anterior superior iliac spine, the iliac fascia forms an open, curved superior edge, known as the iliopectineal arch (see <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 77.1</a>). This arch passes directly over the femoral nerve, and iliacus and psoas major. The medial extent of the arch is attached to the iliopubic ramus, where it receives a slip from the tendon of psoas minor, when this muscle is present (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib49" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_49">Neumann and Garceau 2015</a>). The external iliac vessels are anterior to the fascia but the branches of the lumbar plexus are posterior to it. The fascia is separated from the peritoneum by loose extraperitoneal tissue. Lateral to the femoral vessels the iliac fascia is continuous with the posterior margin of the inguinal ligament and the transversalis fascia. Medially, it passes behind the femoral vessels to become the pectineal ligament, attached to the pecten pubis. At the junction of its lateral and medial parts, it is attached to the iliopubic ramus and the capsule of the hip joint. It thus forms a septum between the inguinal ligament and the hip bone, dividing the space here into a lateral part, the muscular space, containing psoas major, iliacus and the femoral nerve, and a medial part, the vascular space, transmitting the femoral vessels (see <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0165">Fig. 77.2</a>).

The membrane is attached to the sharp margin of the obturator foramen except at its inferolateral angle, where it is fixed to the pelvic surface of the ischial ramus, i.e. internal to the foramen. Its fibres are arranged mainly transversely in interlacing bundles; the uppermost bundle, which is attached to the obturator tubercles, completes the obturator canal.

The bone articulates in front with its fellow and posteriorly with the sacrum to form the pelvic girdle. Each hip bone has three parts, ilium, ischium and pubis, connected to each other by cartilage in youth but united as one bone in adults. The principal union is in the acetabulum. The ilium includes the upper acetabulum and expanded area above it; the ischium includes the posteroinferior acetabulum and bone posteroinferior to it; the pubis forms the anteroinferior acetabulum.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0020"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000077X/main.assets/f77-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0020"/><a id="fspara0020"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 77.4</span> Left hip bone. <span class="bold">A</span>, External aspect. <span class="bold">B</span>, Muscle attachments. <span class="bold">A</span>, Key: 1, iliac crest; 2, anterior superior iliac spine; 3, anterior inferior iliac spine; 4, iliopubic (iliopectineal) eminence; 5, acetabulum; 6, pubic tubercle; 7, acetabular notch; 8, pubis; 9, tubercle of iliac crest; 10, ilium; 11, posterior superior iliac spine; 12, greater sciatic notch; 13, posterior inferior iliac spine; 14, ischial spine; 15, lesser sciatic notch; 16, obturator foramen; 17, ischial tuberosity; 18, ischium. <span class="bold">B</span>, Key: 1, internal abdominal oblique; 2, external abdominal oblique; 3, tensor fasciae latae; 4, gluteus minimus; 5, sartorius; 6, rectus femoris, straight head; 7, rectus femoris, reflected head; 8, junction between ilium, ischium and pubis; 9, pectineus; 10, rectus abdominis, lateral head; 11, pyramidalis; 12, adductor longus; 13, obturator externus; 14, adductor brevis; 15, gracilis; 16, junction between ischium and pubis; 17, latissimus dorsi; 18, gluteus medius; 19, gluteus maximus; 20, piriformis; 21, gemellus superior; 22, semimembranosus; 23, quadratus femoris; 24, biceps femoris and semitendinosus; 25, adductor magnus.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0025"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000077X/main.assets/f77-05-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0025"/><a id="fspara0025"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 77.5</span> Left hip bone. <span class="bold">A</span>, Internal (pelvic) aspect. <span class="bold">B</span>, Muscle attachments. <span class="bold">A</span>, Key: 1, iliac tuberosity; 2, auricular surface; 3, greater sciatic notch; 4, ischial spine; 5, lesser sciatic notch; 6, ischial tuberosity; 7, ischiopubic (inferior pubic) ramus; 8, iliac fossa; 9, anterior superior iliac spine; 10, anterior inferior iliac spine; 11, iliopubic (iliopectineal) eminence; 12, superior pubic ramus; 13, pecten pubis; 14, obturator foramen; 15, pubic tubercle; 16, symphysial surface. <span class="bold">B</span>, Key: 1, quadratus lumborum; 2, erector spinae; 3, obturator internus; 4, coccygeus; 5, levator ani; 6, sacrotuberous ligament; 7, transversus perinei superificalis; 8, transversus abdominis; 9, iliacus; 10, sartorius; 11, rectus femoris; 12, psoas minor; 13, junction between ilium, ischium and pubis; 14, levator ani; 15, junction between ischium and pubis; 16, sphincter urethrae.</figcaption></figure></div><section><a id="s0110"/><section><a id="s0115"/><section><a id="s0120"/><h4 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0115">Acetabulum</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0145">The acetabulum (see <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 77.4A</a>) is an approximately hemispherical cavity situated about the centre of the lateral aspect of the hip bone.

It is divided into iliac tuberosity and auricular and pelvic surfaces. The iliac tuberosity, a large, rough area below the dorsal segment of the iliac crest, shows cranial and caudal areas separated by an oblique ridge and connected to the sacrum by the interosseous sacroiliac ligament. The sacropelvic surface gives attachment to the posterior sacroiliac ligaments and, behind the auricular surface, to the interosseous sacroiliac ligament. The iliolumbar ligament is attached to its anterior part. The auricular surface, immediately anteroinferior to the tuberosity, articulates with the lateral sacral mass. Shaped like an ear, its widest part is anterosuperior, and its ‘lobule’ posteroinferior and on the medial aspect of the posterior inferior spine. Its edges are well defined but the surface, though articular, is rough and irregular. It articulates with the sacrum and is reciprocally shaped. The anterior sacroiliac ligament is attached to its sharp anterior and inferior borders. The narrow part of the pelvic surface, between the auricular surface and the upper rim of the greater sciatic notch, often shows a rough pre-auricular sulcus (that is usually better defined in females) for the lower fibres of the anterior sacroiliac ligament.

At a higher level the femoral surface is covered by piriformis, from which it is partially separated by the sciatic nerve and the nerve to quadratus femoris. The posterior surface, facing superolaterally, is continuous above with the iliac gluteal surface, and here a low convexity follows the acetabular curvature. Inferiorly, this surface forms the upper part of the ischial tuberosity, above which is a wide, shallow groove on its lateral and medial aspects. Above the ischial tuberosity the posterior surface is crossed by the tendon of obturator internus and the gemelli. The nerve to quadratus femoris lies between these structures and the ischium. The ischial tuberosity is a large, rough area on the lower posterior surface and inferior extremity of the ischium. Though obscured by gluteus maximus in hip extension, it is more readily palpable in hip flexion.

Its anterior limbs are the ischiopubic rami (joined by the inferior pubic (arcuate) ligament) and its posterior margins are the sacrotuberous ligaments, with the coccyx in the midline. The outlet is thus not rigid in its posterior half, being limited by ligaments and the coccyx, all slightly yielding. Even with the sacrum taken as the posterior midline limit (more reliable for measurement), there is typically slight mobility at the sacroiliac joints. Note also that a plane of the pelvic outlet is merely conceptual. The anterior, ischiopubic part has a plane that is inclined down and back to a transverse line between the lower limits of the ischial tuberosities, and the posterior half has a plane approximating to the sacrotuberous ligaments, sloping down and forwards to the same line.</div><div class="text" id="p0465">Three measurements are made for the pelvic outlet.

When prolonged (projected), it passes through the umbilicus and mid-coccyx. An axis is similarly established for the inferior aperture: projected upwards, it impinges on the sacral promontory.

The form of this pelvic axis and the disparity in depth between the anterior and posterior contours of the cavity are prime factors in the mechanism of fetal transit in the pelvic canal.</div><div class="text" id="p0505">In the standing position, the pelvic canal curves obliquely backwards relative to the trunk and abdominal cavity. The whole pelvis is tilted forwards, the plane of the pelvic brim making an angle of 50–60° with the horizontal. The plane of the pelvic outlet is tilted to about 15°. Strictly, the pelvic outlet has two planes: an anterior passing backwards from the pubic symphysis and a posterior passing forwards from the coccyx, both descending to meet at the intertuberous line. In standing, the pelvic aspect of the pubic symphysis faces nearly as much upwards as backwards and the sacral concavity is directed anteroinferiorly. The front of the pubic symphysis and anterior superior iliac spines are in the same vertical plane. While sitting, body weight is transmitted through the inferomedial parts of the ischial tuberosities, with variable soft tissues intervening. The anterior superior iliac spines are in a vertical plane through the acetabular centres, and the whole pelvis is tilted back with the lumbosacral angle somewhat diminished at the sacral promontory.</div></section><section><a id="s0375"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0350">Pelvic mechanism</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0515">The skeletal pelvis supports and protects the contained viscera but is primarily part of the lower limbs, affording wide attachment for muscles of the thigh, leg and trunk. It constitutes the major mechanism for transmitting the weight of the head, trunk and upper limbs to the lower limbs. It may be considered as two arches divided by a coronal transacetabular plane. The posterior arch, chiefly concerned in transmitting weight, consists of the upper three sacral vertebrae and strong pillars of bone from the sacroiliac joints to the acetabular fossae. The anterior arch, formed by the pubic bones and their superior rami, connects these lateral pillars as a tie beam to prevent separation; it also acts as a compression strut against medial femoral thrust. The sacrum, as the summit of the posterior arch, is loaded at the lumbosacral joint. Theoretically, this force has two components: one thrusting the sacrum downwards and backwards between the iliac bones, the other thrusting its upper end downwards and forwards. Sacroiliac joint movements are regulated by osseous shape and massive ligaments. The first component therefore acts against the wedge, its tendency to separate iliac bones resisted by the sacroiliac and iliolumbar ligaments and pubic symphysis.</div><div class="text" id="p0520">Vertical coronal sections through the sacroiliac joints suggest division of the (synovial) articular region of the sacrum into three segments. In the anterosuperior segment, involving the first sacral vertebra, the articular surfaces are slightly sinuous and almost parallel. In the middle segment, the posterior width between the articular markings is greater than the anterior, and centrally a sacral concavity fits a corresponding iliac convexity, an interlocking mechanism relieving the strain on the ligaments produced by body weight. In the posteroinferior segment, the anterior sacral width is greater than the posterior and here its sacral surfaces are slightly concave. Anteroinferior sacral dislocation by the second component (of force) is prevented, therefore, mainly by the middle segment, owing to its cuneiform shape and interlocking mechanism. However, some rotation occurs, in which the anterosuperior segment tilts down and the posteroinferior segment up. ‘Superior’ segmental movement is limited to a small degree by wedging but primarily by tension in the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments. In all movements, the sacroiliac and iliolumbar ligaments and pubic symphysis resist separation of the iliac bones.</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0380"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0355">Sexual differences in the pelvis</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0525">The pelvis provides the most marked skeletal differences between male and female. Although there is some skeletal sexual dimorphism in infancy and childhood, most researchers agree that this is minimal. There are methods that focus on the shape of the greater sciatic notch, but they are quite unreliable. Sexual differences in adults are divisible into metrical and non-metrical features; the range of most features overlaps between the sexes.</div><div class="text" id="p0530">Differences are inevitably linked to function. Although the primary pelvic function in both sexes is locomotor, the pelvis, particularly the lesser pelvis, is adapted to parturition in females, and these changes variably affect the proportions and dimensions of the greater pelvis (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Betti and Manica 2018</a>). Since males are stereotypically more muscular and therefore more heavily built, overall pelvic dimensions, such as the intercristal distance (distance between the iliac crests), are greater, markings for muscles and ligaments more pronounced, and general architecture more robust. The male iliac crest is more rugged and more medially inclined at its anterior end; in females the iliac crests are less curved in all parts. The iliac alae are more vertical in females but do not ascend so far; the iliac fossae are therefore shallower. These iliac peculiarities probably account for the greater prominence of female hips.</div><div class="text" id="p0535">The male is more robust above the pelvis, with consequent differences at the lumbosacral and hip joints. The sacral basal articular facet for the fifth lumbar vertebra and intervening intervertebral disc is more than one-third of the total sacral basal width in males but less than one-third in females, in whom the sacrum is also relatively broader, accentuating this difference. The female has relatively broader sacral alae. The male acetabulum is larger, and its diameter is approximately equal to the distance between its anterior rim and pubic symphysis. In females, acetabular diameter is usually less than this distance, not only because it is smaller but also because the anterolateral wall of the cavity is comparatively and often absolutely wider. The height of the female pubic symphysis and adjoining parts of the pubis and ischium, which form the anterior pelvic wall, are also less, producing a somewhat triangular obturator foramen, which is more ovoid in males. Differing pubic growth is also expressed in the pubic arch below the pubic symphysis and between the inferior pubic rami. It is more angular in males, being 50–60°; in females it is rounded, less easy to measure and usually 80–85°. A greater separation of the pubic tubercles in females contributes to the pubic width. The ischiopubic rami are also much more lightly built and narrowed near the symphysis; in males they bear a distinctly rough, everted area for attachment of the penile crura and in females the corresponding attachment for the clitoris is the ventral arc. The ischial spines are closer in males and are more inturned. The greater sciatic notch is usually wider in females: mean values for males and females are 50.4° and 74.4°, respectively. The greater female values for angle and width are associated with increased backward sacral tilt and greater anteroposterior pelvic diameter, especially at lower levels.</div><div class="text" id="p0540">The sacrum also displays metrical sexual differences. Female sacra are less curved, the curvature being most marked between the first and second segments and the third and fifth, with an intervening flatter region. Male sacra are more evenly curved, and relatively long and narrow, and more often exceed five segments (by addition of a lumbar or coccygeal vertebra). The sacral index compares sacral breadth (between the most anterior points on the auricular surfaces) with length (between midpoints on the anterior margins of the promontory and apex): average values for males and females are 105% and 115%, respectively. Auricular surfaces are relatively smaller and more oblique in females, but extend on to the upper three sacral vertebrae in both sexes. The dorsal auricular border is more concave in females. Many differences may be summarized in the generalization that the pelvic cavity is longer and more conical in males, and shorter and more cylindrical in females; the axis is curved in both. Differences are greater at the inferior aperture than at the brim, where in absolute measurements males are not as different from females as sometimes stated.</div><div class="text" id="p0545">In forensic practice, identification of human skeletal remains (which are sometimes fragmentary) usually involves estimation of sex, and this is most reliably established from an examination of the pelvis. Even fragments of the pelvis can be useful in this respect, and may be considered alongside skull robusticity or gracility and long bone metrics. Pelvic features taken into account include the subpubic angle, pubic width, sacral curvature, width of the greater sciatic notch, and the proportion of the body of the first sacral vertebra compared to the alae. It is important to consider all data available for measuring skeletal sexual dimorphism of the pelvis and skull, as assessment of sex from isolated and often incomplete human remains is less reliable.

Its length is associated with a striding gait, and its strength with the weight and muscular forces it is required to withstand. Its shaft, almost cylindrical along most of its length, is bowed forwards. It has a proximal rounded, articular head projecting medially from its short neck, which, in turn, is a medial extension of the proximal shaft. The distal extremity is wider and more substantial, and presents two condyles that articulate with the tibia. In standing, the femoral shafts show an inclination upwards and outwards from their tibial articulations, with the femoral heads being separated by the pelvic width. Since the tibia and fibula descend vertically from the knees, the ankles are also in the line of body weight in standing or walking. The degree of femoral obliquity varies between individuals but is generally greater in women, reflecting the relatively greater pelvic breadth and shorter femora.

Its long axis makes an angle of approximately 10° with the vertical, and diverges 5–7° from the long axis of the tibia. Its middle one-third has three surfaces and borders. The extensive anterior surface, smooth and gently convex, is between the lateral and medial borders, which are both round and indistinct. The posterolateral surface is bounded posteriorly by the broad, rough and often raised, linea aspera, usually a crest with lateral <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1363" id="pagebreak_1363"/><a id="pg1363"/>and medial edges. Its subjacent compact bone is augmented to withstand compressive forces, which are concentrated here by the anterior curvature of the shaft. The linea aspera gives at least partial attachment to adductors longus and brevis, adductor magnus, vastus medialis and lateralis, intermuscular septa (partially continuous with the fascia lata of the thigh), and the short head of biceps femoris, all inseparably blended at their attachments. Perforating arteries cross the linea aspera laterally under tendinous arches in adductor magnus and biceps femoris. Nutrient foramina, directed proximally, appear in the linea aspera, varying in number and site, one usually near its proximal end, a second usually near its distal end. The posteromedial surface, smooth like the others, is bounded in front by the indistinct medial border and behind by the linea aspera. In its proximal third the shaft has a fourth, posterior surface, bounded medially by the narrow, rough spiral line. Laterally, this surface is limited by the broad, rough gluteal tuberosity, ascending a little laterally to the greater trochanter and descending to the lateral edge of the linea aspera. In its distal one-third, the posterior surface of the shaft presents a further surface, the popliteal surface (see below) between the medial and lateral supracondylar lines. These lines are continuous above with the corresponding edges of the linea aspera.

The superior medial genicular artery, a branch of the popliteal artery, arches medially above the medial condyle. It is separated from bone by the medial head of gastrocnemius. The latter is attached a little above the condyle; further distally, there may be a smooth facet underlying a bursa for the medial head of gastrocnemius.

Anteriorly, the condyles are confluent and continue into the shaft; posteriorly, they are separated by a deep intercondylar fossa and project beyond the plane of the popliteal surface. The articular surface is a broad area, like an inverted U, for the patella and the tibia. The patellar surface extends anteriorly on both condyles, especially the lateral. It is transversely concave, vertically convex and grooved for the posterior patellar surface.

The medial groove is restricted to the medial part of the medial condyle and rests on the anterior edge of the medial meniscus in full extension. Where it ceases, the patellar surface continues back to the lateral part of the medial condyle as a semilunar area adjoining the anterior region of the intercondylar fossa.

The wall is thick in its middle third, where the femur is narrowest and the medullary cavity most capacious. Proximally and distally the compact wall becomes progressively thinner, and the cavity gradually fills with trabecular bone. The extremities, especially the articular areas, consist of trabecular bone within a thin shell of compact bone, their trabeculae being disposed along lines of greatest stress. At the proximal end the main trabeculae form a series of plates orthogonal to the articular surface, converging to a central dense wedge, which is supported by strong trabeculae passing to the sides of the neck, especially along its upper and lower profiles (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0070"><span class="bold">Fig. 77.16</span></a>). Force applied to the femoral head is therefore transmitted to the wedge and from there to the junction of the neck and shaft. This junction is strengthened by dense trabeculae extending laterally from the lesser trochanter to the end of the superior aspect of the neck, thus resisting tensile or shearing forces applied to the neck through the head (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0075"><span class="bold">Fig. 77.17</span></a>). Tensile and compressive tests indicate that axial trabeculae of the femoral head withstand much greater stresses than peripheral trabeculae. A smaller bar across the junction of the greater trochanter with the neck and shaft resists shearing caused by forces produced by local muscles such as the gluteus medius. A thin vertical plate, the so-called calcar femorale, ascends from the compact wall near the linea aspera into the trabeculae of the neck (see <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0075">Fig. 77.17</a>). Medially, it joins the posterior wall of the neck; laterally, it continues into the greater trochanter, where it disperses into general trabecular bone. It is thus in a plane anterior to the trochanteric crest and base of the lesser trochanter. <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib25" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_25">Dixon (1910)</a> demonstrated that the trabecular framework of the proximal femur was spiral, and that the ‘arches’ were simplified sectional profiles of this spiral. At the distal end of the femur, trabeculae spring from the entire internal surface of compact bone, descending perpendicular to the articular surface. Proximal to the condyles these are strongest and most accurately perpendicular. Horizontal planes of trabecular bone, arranged like crossed girders, form a series of cubical compartments.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0070"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000077X/main.assets/f77-14-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0070"/><a id="fspara0070"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 77.16</span> A coronal section through the left hip joint. <br/><span class="figcredit">Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy © Elsevier GmbH, Urban &amp; Fischer, Munich.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p5650"><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0075"><!--<img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000077X/main.assets/f77-15-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/>--><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0075"/><a id="fspara0075"/><!--<span class="fignum">Fig. 77.17</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, A coronal section through the proximal end of the femur showing the trabecular architecture, calcar femorale and variations in cortical thickness.<a id="fspara10075"/>(B, <span class="italic">continued online</span>) <br/><span class="figcredit">Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy © Elsevier GmbH, Urban &amp; Fischer, Munich.</span>--></figcaption></figure></div></div><div id="p0650"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0190"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000077X/main.assets/on77-05-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0195"/><a id="fspara0200"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 77.17</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, A coronal section through the proximal end of the femur showing the trabecular architecture, calcar femorale and variations in cortical thickness. <span class="bold">B</span>, A coronal oblique CT of the proximal femur showing the calcar femorale (arrowheads) with the axial plane inset; the dotted red lines show the respective cross-sections. <br/><span class="figcredit">A, Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy © Elsevier GmbH, Urban &amp; Fischer, Munich.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><section><a id="s0470"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0435">Muscle attachments</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0655">The greater trochanter provides attachment for glutei medius and minimus.

Branches from the arterial ring pierce the capsule (under its zona orbicularis) to ascend the neck beneath the reflected synovial membrane. These vessels become the retinacular arteries and form a subsynovial intracapsular anastomosis. Here the vessels are at risk with a displaced fracture of the femoral neck. Interruption of blood supply in this way can lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head. If the fracture is intracapsular, not only is the intraosseous blood supply damaged but the retinacular vessels are also vulnerable. If the fracture is extracapsular, the retinacular vessels will remain intact and avascular necrosis of the femoral head is much less likely. The ascending cervical vessels give off metaphysial branches that enter the neck, while the intracapsular ring gives off lateral and inferior epiphysial branches. A small medial epiphysial supply reaches the head along the ligament of the head of femur by the acetabular branches of the obturator and medial circumflex femoral arteries, which anastomose with the other epiphysial vessels (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib59" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_59">Seeley et al 2016</a>). During growth, the epiphysial plate separates the territories of the metaphysial and epiphysial vessels; these vessels anastomose freely after osseous union of the head and neck. Observations of developmental patterns of this supply in late fetal and early postnatal periods have revealed that although the medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries at first contribute equally, two major branches of the medial provide the final supply, both posterior to the neck. The supply from the lateral circumflex femoral artery diminishes and the arterial ring is interrupted. As the femoral neck elongates, the extracapsular circle becomes more distant from the epiphysial part of the head.</div><div class="text" id="p0690">The trochanteric regions and subtrochanteric shaft are supplied by the trochanteric and cruciate arterial anastomoses. More distally in the shaft, nutrient foramina, directed proximally, are found in the linea aspera, varying in number and site: one is usually near its proximal end and a second usually near its distal end. The main nutrient artery is usually derived from the second perforating artery (see <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_split_a.xhtml#pg1389">p. 1389</a>). If two nutrient arteries occur, they may branch from the first and third perforators. Periosteal vessels arise from the perforators and from the profunda femoris artery, and run circumferentially rather than longitudinally. The distal metaphysis has many vascular foramina. Arterial supply here is from the genicular anastomosis.

Other than the clavicle, it is the first long bone to ossify.The process starts in the mid-shaft during embryonic stages 22 and 23 (postfertilization days 52–58) and extends to produce a miniature shaft that is largely ossified at birth. Secondary centres appear in the distal end (from which the condyles and epicondyles are formed) during postmenstrual weeks 33–36; in the greater trochanter during the fourth year; and in the lesser trochanter between the twelfth and fourteenth years. In the infant, the femoral head is entirely cartilaginous: it cannot be seen on plain radiographs and is best visualized using ultrasound (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0200"><span class="bold">Fig. 77.20</span></a>).

The medial epiphysial margin later grows over this part of the articular surface. Thus, the mature epiphysis is a hollow cup on the summit of the neck.

Any surgery in the hip region in children can injure the growth plate, resulting in abnormal proximal femoral development. In the case of fractures involving the epiphysis, expeditious restoration of normal bony alignment is essential in order to minimize the risk of subsequent abnormal growth.</div><div class="text" id="p0725">The growth plate represents a line of weakness and predisposes to fracture from injury. Such acute injuries affecting the capital epiphysis are uncommon. However, a more chronic fracture through the capital epiphysis occurs in slipped capital femoral epiphysis (see <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0250">Fig. 77.29</a>). The condition affects pubescent adolescents, especially males. The femoral head epiphysis displaces posteriorly off the femoral neck. If it heals in this position, lower limb deformity and restricted hip <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1366" id="pagebreak_1366"/><a id="pg1365.e1"/>movement occur. A classic hallmark is obligatory lateral (external) rotation of the femur as the hip is flexed. Treatment varies according to the time taken for the ‘slip’ to occur. Normal anatomical restoration is not attempted because of an increased incidence of avascular necrosis. The position of the femoral head may be accepted as it is and fixed with screws in this position to stop further displacement. This treatment will deliberately cause premature growth plate fusion and so prevent future ‘slippage’. Since the distal femoral growth plate accounts for most of the normal increase in longitudinal growth of the femoral shaft, an acceptable limb length difference usually results.</div><div class="text" id="p0730">Infection of bone in neonates and young children tends to arise via bacteria in the blood stream that usually ‘seed’ in the metaphysial region, probably as a consequence of the vascular ‘arcade’ arrangement of arteries in this part of the bone. The proximal femoral growth plate is intra-articular. As a result, infection in the proximal femoral metaphysis can spread into the joint and result in a septic arthritis that can destroy the hip joint permanently.</div><div class="text" id="p0735">The distal end of the femur is the only epiphysis in which ossification consistently starts just before birth; the phenomenon therefore serves as a reliable indicator of the gestational maturity of a stillborn baby. Since the epiphysial plate is level with the adductor tubercle, the epiphysis is partly extra-articular. Operations here may damage the distal epiphysial cartilage in children and result in subsequent shortening of the leg.</div></section></section></section></section></section><a id="s0495"/><hgroup><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0460">Joints</h2><h3 class="h2after1" id="cesectitle0465">Pubic symphysis</h3></hgroup><section><a id="s0500"/><div class="textfl" id="p0740">The pubic bones meet in the midline at the pubic symphysis, a secondary cartilaginous joint (see <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0165">Figs 77.2</a>–<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0015">77.3</a>).</div><section><a id="s0505"/><section><a id="s0510"/><section><a id="s0515"/><section><a id="s0520"/><section><a id="s0525"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0470">Articulating surfaces</p><div class="textfl" id="p0745">The articulating surfaces are the medial (symphysial) surfaces of the pubic bones, each covered by a thin layer of tightly adherent hyaline cartilage (surface growth cartilage in the young).

The articular surfaces of the femoral head and the acetabulum are reciprocally curved but neither coextensive nor completely congruent (see <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0205">Fig. 77.21</a>; see <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0070">Fig. 77.16</a>). The close-packed position of the hip joint is one of full extension, with slight abduction and medial rotation (see also <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_split_a.xhtml#t0010">Table 5.4</a>). This position winds up most of the joint’s capsular ligaments, which can provide an important element of articular stability. The femoral head is covered by articular cartilage, except over the fovea where the ligament of the head of the femur (ligamentum teres) is attached. Anteriorly, the cartilage extends laterally over a small area on the adjoining neck. Articular cartilage is, generally, thicker centrally than peripherally. Cartilage thickness is maximal anterosuperiorly in the acetabulum and anterolaterally on the femoral head, the two areas that correspond to the principal load-bearing areas within the joint. The acetabular articular surface, the lunate surface, is an incomplete ring, broadest anterosuperiorly where the pressure of body weight falls in the erect posture, and narrowest in its pubic region. It is deficient inferiorly opposite the acetabular notch. The lunate surface is covered by articular cartilage, which is thickest where the surface is broadest. The acetabular fossa, the central non-articular area in the floor of the acetabulum, is devoid of cartilage but contains fibroelastic fat largely covered by synovial membrane. The acetabular labrum, a fibrocartilaginous rim attached to the acetabular margin, serves to deepen the acetabulum and bridges the acetabular notch by attaching to the peripheral edge of the transverse acetabular ligament. The acetabular labrum is triangular in section, attached by its base to the acetabular margin and blending with adjacent articular cartilage; its acute free edge projects beyond the acetabular margin. The diameter of the acetabular cavity is constricted by the labral rim, which embraces the femoral head, thereby contributing to the stability of the articulation. The acetabular labrum increases the surface area for joint contact as well as sealing the joint, allowing optimal intra-articular distribution of synovial fluid (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">Ferguson et al 2003</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Cadet et al 2012</a>).

Consider, for example, the normal shape of the femoral head and neck region. Similar to the shape of a light bulb, the spherical femoral head narrows gradually at its junction with the neck of the femur. This tapering limits large contact stress between the femoral neck and the margin of the acetabulum. However, tapering may be lost because of natural variation or underlying pathology, resulting in a specific deformity that has been referred to as a cam deformity because the head and neck of the femur, together, resemble a camshaft. Although often subtle, this deformity may be detected radiographically (see arrow in <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0220"><span class="bold">Fig. 77.23</span></a>). In some patients with a cam deformity, extreme and repeated motions of the hip, typically involving combinations of flexion, medial rotation and adduction, can create damaging impingement between the hard and bulbous femoral neck and the softer acetabular labrum. The anterosuperior section of the labrum is particularly vulnerable to this type of injury, which is a painful and often motion-limiting condition referred to as femoro-acetabular impingement syndrome. The repeatedly traumatized section of the labrum can become enlarged, fragmented or torn. When the acetabular labrum is torn, a hip joint may become unstable as a consequence of the loss of the natural suction seal around the joint. In some advanced cases, the impingement trauma may create lesions at the chondrolabral junction, resulting in damage to the adjacent articular cartilage, potentially predisposing the hip joint to degenerative arthritis (osteoarthrosis) (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_5">Beck et al 2005</a>).

Anteriorly, many fibres ascend along the neck as longitudinal retinacula, containing blood vessels for both the femoral head and the neck. The capsule is thicker anterosuperiorly, where maximal stress occurs, particularly while standing with the hip extended. Posteroinferiorly, it is relatively thin and loosely attached. The capsule as a whole has two sets of fibres, circular and longitudinal. The circular fibres (zona orbicularis) are internal and form a collar round the femoral neck; although partly blended with the pubofemoral and ischiofemoral ligaments, these fibres are not directly attached to bone. Externally, longitudinal fibres are most numerous in the anterosuperior region, where they are reinforced by the iliofemoral ligament. The capsule is also strengthened inferiorly by the pubofemoral ligament, and posteriorly by the ischiofemoral ligament. Externally the capsule is rough, covered by muscles and tendons, and separated anteriorly from psoas major and iliacus by a bursa. The capsular attachment to the femur lies well distal to the growth plate of the femoral head both anteriorly and posteriorly, and so the upper femoral epiphysis is entirely intracapsular. The capsular attachment intersects the growth plate of the greater trochanter on the superior surface of the base of the neck.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0710"/><h5 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0620">Iliocapsularis</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0935">Iliocapsularis (also called iliacus minor or iliotrochantericus) is a little-known but constant muscle that lies immediately deep to the tendon of iliopsoas and overlies the anterior hip capsule (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib2" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_2">Babst et al 2011</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib81" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_81">Ward et al 2000</a>). Typically present as just a few strands of fibres, it originates from the anteromedial hip capsule and anteroinferior iliac spine, and is attached just distal to the lesser trochanter.

Anteriorly, lateral fibres of pectineus separate the capsule from the femoral vein. Lateral to this, the tendon of psoas major, with iliacus lateral to it, descends en route to the lesser trochanter, partly separated from the capsule by a bursa. The femoral artery is anterior to the tendon of psoas major, and the femoral nerve lies deep in a groove between the tendon and iliacus. More laterally the straight head of rectus femoris crosses the joint with a deep layer of the iliotibial tract, which blends with the capsule under the lateral border of the muscle. Superiorly the reflected head of rectus femoris contacts the capsule medially, while gluteus minimus covers it laterally, being either closely adherent or comingled (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib80" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_80">Walters et al 2014</a>).

These retinacular arteries enter the joint capsule in the trochanteric fossa and ascend the femoral neck on its outer aspect superiorly and posteriorly. They pass around the edge of the growth plate (physis) and enter the femoral head. A minor contribution to the vascular supply comes from the ligament of the head of the femur. Any damage to these vessels (e.g. trauma, infection) can result in the devastating complication of avascular necrosis of the femoral head. The growth plate represents a line of weakness and predisposes to fracture from injury. Acute injuries affecting the capital epiphysis are uncommon.

Pain over the lateral aspect of the hip usually suggests a local problem such as gluteus medius or minimus tendinopathy and associated trochanteric bursitis (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_10">Bird et al 2001</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib37" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_37">Grimaldi and Fearon 2015</a>).

The biomechanical features of the human lower limb, which functions primarily to allow stance and bipedal propulsion, are very different from those of the quadruped lower limb, and these differences are reflected in the anatomy and biomechanics of the human hip, knee, ankle and foot joints.</div><section><a id="s0795"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0690">Stability and movement</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1055">The hip joint is normally very stable. The femoral head is closely fitted to the acetabulum in an area exceeding half a sphere, forming a multiaxial spheroidal (‘ball and socket’) joint that allows relatively unhindered motion in three degrees of freedom, i.e. flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and medial/lateral rotation. However, the femoral head is also embraced closely by the acetabular labrum, which restrains it in the socket and innately limits its capacity for translational motion in anteroposterior, transverse and vertical directions. The thick capsule is reinforced by the three major ligaments: iliofemoral, pubofemoral and ischiofemoral. The iliofemoral ligament is the strongest, and is progressively tightened when the femur extends to and beyond the line of the trunk. The pubofemoral and ischiofemoral ligaments also tighten when this happens and, as the joint approaches the close-packed position, resistance to an extending torque increases rapidly. The transverse acetabular ligament and ligament of the head of the femur may also contribute to stability.</div><div class="text" id="p1060">A ‘vacuum effect’ within the hip joint is present, which means that only slight separation of the articular surfaces can be achieved by strong traction on the joint. To aid insertion of an arthroscope, a needle is first inserted into the joint to eliminate the suction effect; the joint will subsequently open sufficiently with traction. Traumatic dislocation usually occurs only when the joint is subjected to extreme force.</div></section><section><a id="s0800"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0695">Femur</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1065">The femur is essentially a tubular structure with distortions that consist of bows and twists. The most notable is the anterior bow in its mid portion, where the radius of curvature is relatively constant along the length of the femoral shaft. In the coronal plane, the femoral neck is inclined obliquely to the shaft at an angle of about 125°, although this angle can vary considerably (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0095"><span class="bold">Fig. 77.30</span></a>). Although both the neck–shaft angle (collodiaphysial angle; Mikulicz angle) and neck length are variable, the centre of the neck in the coronal plane is at the level of the apex of the greater trochanter. The neck–shaft angle facilitates freedom of movement of the femur, enabling it to swing clear of the pelvis. The neck also provides an adequate lever for the action of the muscles acting about the hip joint, most notably the hip abductors, which are attached to the proximal femur. The neck–shaft angle is widest at birth and diminishes gradually until the age of 10 years (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Birkenmaier et al 2010</a>); it is smaller in females. In the axial plane, the femoral neck is anteverted, i.e. rotated anteriorly relative to the posterior surfaces of the femoral condyles; in the adult, this angle is typically about 10–15° (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0255"><span class="bold">Fig. 77.31A</span></a>).

At birth, the angle of anteversion is typically about 35–40°. As the child develops, forces from muscles and gravity cause the angle of anteversion to decrease gradually, approaching 15° by young adulthood. Excessive anteversion usually persists beyond childhood in cases of abnormal motor development, such as can be seen with cerebral palsy.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0095"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000077X/main.assets/f77-22-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0095"/><a id="fspara0095"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 77.30</span> The neck–shaft angle (NSA) is shown between the long axis of the femoral shaft (S) and the axis of the femoral neck (N).

Femoral-on-pelvic hip kinematics describes the rotation of the femur about a relatively fixed pelvis. Conversely, pelvic-on-femoral (hip) kinematics describes the rotation of the pelvis, and often the superimposed trunk, over a relatively fixed femur or set of femurs. Regardless of whether the femur or the pelvis is the moving segment, kinematics are described for all three cardinal planes on the assumption that movements are initiated from the anatomical position.</div><div class="text" id="p1095">Flexion and extension are motions that occur in the sagittal plane. To appreciate the hip joint arthrokinematics that accompany the associated femoral-on-pelvic motions, the length and angulation of the femoral neck in relation to the shaft must be considered. As the hip (femur) is flexed about 120° towards the anterior thoracic wall, or extended 10–20° beyond the plane of the trunk, the femoral head ‘spins’ in the acetabulum about a side-to-side (medial–lateral) axis of rotation. Conversely, from a pelvic-on-femoral perspective, the acetabula rotate around a similar axis in flexion and extension relative to stationary femoral heads (compare <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0260"><span class="bold">Figs 77.32A</span> and <span class="bold">B</span></a>). Depending on the accompanying trunk movement, the lumbar vertebrae will either flex or extend in rhythm with the rotating pelvis. Consider, for example, a short-arc anterior rotation (or tilt) of the pelvis over both femurs while the upper trunk remains stationary. During this motion, the lumbar vertebrae extend slightly towards greater lordosis. By comparison, rotating both the pelvis and the trunk over both femurs (as in reaching towards the ground with knees held extended), the pelvis and the thoracolumbar vertebrae both flex, thereby augmenting the overall forward motion of the body as a whole.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0260"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000077X/main.assets/on77-16-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0265"/><a id="fspara0280"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 77.32</span> Hip flexion shown from two kinematic perspectives, as indicated by the green curved arrows. <span class="bold">A</span>, Femoral-on-pelvic flexion. <span class="bold">B</span>, Pelvic-on-femoral flexion.

Abduction at the support hip occurs by raising the contralateral side of the pelvis a few degrees (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0265"><span class="bold">Fig. 77.33B</span></a>). Marked tightness in the hip adductor muscles or medial capsule of the hip on the support hip can limit this pelvic motion.

Assuming that the trunk remains nearly stationary during these short-arc pelvic-on-femoral motions, the lumbar spine laterally bends slightly as a way to offset undesired thoracic motion. The lumbar vertebrae, therefore, act to decouple motion of the pelvis (moving on the femur) from undesired motions between the thorax and pelvis (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib52" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_52">Neumann 2017</a>). This decoupling function of the lumbar vertebrae is especially useful during walking as a way of partially fixing the spatial orientation of the upper thorax, as well as the associated craniocervical region and the embedded senses of vision and equilibrium.

About two-thirds of body weight is located above the hips, and so each femoral head normally accepts about one-third of body weight. This force is compressive in nature, as gravity pulls the acetabula against the femoral heads. When viewed in the sagittal plane, minimal muscle forces suffice to maintain equilibrium as long as the weight of the upper body is directed over or behind the femoral heads. If the upper body leans anteriorly, shifting the upper body weight vector anteriorly beyond the femoral heads and thereby producing a hip flexion moment, posterior thigh muscles can counter such rotation. As the capsular ligaments of the hip slacken in flexion, none of them is able to resist the forward lean.</div><div class="text" id="p1120">Hip joint compression forces vary from one-third of body weight, when both feet are on the ground during standing at ease, to some four times body weight when the other foot is lifted, as during walking. This represents at least a ten-fold increase in compression forces, explaining, in part, why persons with a painful hip often limit the time spent in single-limb stance. The large compression forces generated while walking originate primarily from two sources: gravity and muscle activation. During the stance phase, gravity pulls the upper body and acetabulum inferiorly on the femoral heads (as described above for quiet standing). More significantly, each femoral head is pushed superiorly against its socket as the foot strikes and then pushes against the ground. Although activation of muscles is responsible for a greater portion of joint compression at the hip, the influences of gravity and of capsular tension (when the hip joint is extended) should not be ignored.</div><div class="text" id="p1125">As the lower limb is swinging anteriorly and free of contact with the ground, hip joint compression force is estimated to be at about 50% <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1374" id="pagebreak_1374"/><a id="pg1374"/>of body weight (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Correa et al 2010</a>). Such joint force is essentially myogenic. Consider, for example, a contracting iliopsoas pulling the femoral head against the acetabulum as it simultaneously advances the lower limb in walking.</div><div class="text" id="p1130">In contrast, during the stance phase of walking, hip joint forces may reach four times body weight. These forces are mainly caused by the pull of the hip abductor muscles (primarily gluteus medius, gluteus minimus and tensor fasciae latae). This muscular action, essential to normal bipedal gait, provides the necessary coronal plane stabilization of the pelvis relative to the femoral head of the stance limb.</div><div class="text" id="p1135">The importance of hip abductor muscle activation during the stance phase of walking can be well appreciated by understanding the simple mechanics of standing on one limb (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0100"><span class="bold">Fig. 77.36</span></a>). The lever arm (a) of left hip abductor force (Ab) is about half the length of the lever arm (b) associated with body weight (BW). To balance the competing (coronal plane) gravitational moments about the stance hip, the hip abductors must produce a force about twice superincumbent body weight. Thus, the acetabulum is pulled inferiorly against the femoral head not only by the body weight but also by the force created by the activated hip abductor muscles. The sum of the muscular and gravitational forces therefore approaches 2.5 times the total weight of the person. These downward forces on the head of the femur are counteracted by an upward joint reaction force of equal magnitude (JRF in <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X.xhtml#f0100">Fig. 77.36</a>). Both magnitude and direction of the joint reaction force are strongly influenced by the pull of the hip abductor muscles.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0100"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000077X/main.assets/f77-23-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0100"/><a id="fspara0100"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 77.36</span> While standing on one (left) lower limb, body weight (BW) line of force, i.e. total body weight minus the weight of the left lower limb, passes just lateral to the midline, exerting a counterclockwise moment about the stance hip (BW × b). An equal but clockwise moment is required about the stance hip for mechanical equilibrium: a moment produced by the force of the abductors (Ab), whose lever arm (a) is approximately half that of the lever arm (b). The two moments are in balance when (Ab × a = BW × b). The abductor force required to maintain equilibrium is approximately twice that of BW, resulting in a joint reaction force (JRF) nearly 2.5 times that of total weight of the subject’s body.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p1140">The above analysis is for standing quietly on one limb. During walking, however, the joint reaction force routinely reaches at least four times body weight, reflecting both the high ground reaction forces and the need for the hip abductor muscles to decelerate rotations of the pelvis (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_8">Bergmann et al 1993</a>). Hip joint forces reach still greater values during running or stair-climbing (see review in <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib64" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_64">Stansfield and Nicol 2002</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1145">Compression forces produced by the gluteus medius during stance phase are directed superiorly and slightly anteromedially within the acetabulum (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Correa et al 2010</a>), a region naturally protected by thick articular cartilage. In the healthy hip joint, the muscular-based compressive forces serve important functions, such as helping to stabilize the articulation and stimulate the morphological development of the growing hip. Forces that cross the hip typically do not harm the joint because they are absorbed by healthy articular cartilage and congruent joint surfaces. Failure of these conditions to absorb forces in the joint may predispose to osteoarthritis of the hip.</div><div class="text" id="p1150">The three factors that influence both the magnitude and the direction of compressive forces acting on the hip are the position of the centre of gravity; the abductor moment arm, which is a function of neck length (offset) and neck–shaft angle; and the amount of body weight. Shortening of the lever arm of the abductors, such as occurs in coxa valga or excessive femoral anteversion, or in a remodelled proximal femur in advanced hip osteoarthritis, would increase abductor muscle demand and thus increase joint reaction force as well. If the muscles cannot meet this demand, the pelvis cannot be held level in standing on one limb, a problem known as either a compensated or an uncompensated Trendelenburg sign. The Trendelenburg sign is said to be compensated if the pelvis is brought towards the affected stance limb as a way of shortening the body weight’s lever arm. Conversely, the Trendelenburg sign is said to be uncompensated if the pelvis drops away from the affected stance limb uncontrollably.</div></section><section><a id="s0820"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0715">Muscles producing hip joint movements</h4><div class="textfl" id="p1155">Flexion is primarily produced by psoas major, iliacus and rectus femoris, assisted by pectineus, tensor fasciae latae and sartorius. The adductors, particularly adductor longus and brevis, also assist, especially when the hip is near full extension. Effective action of the hip flexor muscles requires strong synergistic activation of the abdominal muscles to stabilize the pelvis.</div><div class="text" id="p1160">Extension is produced by gluteus maximus, the long head of biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus and adductor magnus. The posterior fibres of gluteus medius assist with this action (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib50" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Neumann 2010</a>). In the fully erect posture, a vertical line through the centre of gravity of the body normally passes just posterior to a line joining the centres of the femoral heads. The body therefore tends to incline posteriorly but this is counterbalanced by ligamentous tension and congruence and compression of the articular surfaces within the hip joints in the close-packed position. Under increased loading of the trunk or leaning posteriorly, these resistive but passive factors are assisted by active force produced by the hip joint flexors. In swaying anteriorly at the ankles, or when the arms are stretched forwards, and also in forward-bending at the hip, the line of body weight moves anterior to the medial–lateral axis of rotation through the hip joints. The posture adopted, or the rate of change of posture, is largely controlled by the hamstrings, which, besides being powerful flexors of the knee, are strong extensors of the hip. Gluteus maximus becomes particularly active when the thigh is extended against resistance, as in rising from a bending position or during climbing.</div><div class="text" id="p1165">Abduction is produced by gluteus medius, gluteus minimus and tensor fasciae latae, assisted by the piriformis and sartorius. The motion is limited by adductor muscle tension, the pubofemoral ligament and the extreme medial bands of the descending part of the iliofemoral ligament. The abductor muscles, most notably glutei medius and minimus, are active periodically at precise phases of the walking or running cycle to ensure coronal plane stability of the pelvis.</div><div class="text" id="p1170">Adduction is produced by adductor longus, brevis and magnus, and gracilis, assisted by pectineus, quadratus femoris and the inferior fibres of gluteus maximus. The range of adduction is limited by the increasing tension in the abductor muscles, the transverse part of the iliofemoral ligament and the fascia lata of the thigh.</div><div class="text" id="p1175">Medial rotation is produced by the anterior fibres of glutei minimus and medius, and assisted by most adductor muscles and, to a lesser extent, the tensor fasciae latae. The strength of medial rotation naturally increases as the hip is flexed because this position increases the moment arm of most medial rotator muscles (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Delp et al 1999</a>). Medial rotation is limited by tension in lateral rotator muscles such as piriformis, the ischiofemoral ligament and the adjacent posterior joint capsule (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib77" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_77">Wagner et al 2012</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1180">Lateral rotation is produced by gluteus maximus, obturator internus, superior and inferior gemelli, quadratus femoris and piriformis, assisted by obturator externus and sartorius.
