Its proximal attachments are complex. They include the anterior surfaces and lower borders of the transverse processes of all the lumbar vertebrae. There are five digitations, each from the bodies of two adjoining vertebrae and their intervertebral disc. The highest of these arises from the lower margin of the body of the twelfth thoracic vertebra, the upper margin of the body of the first lumbar vertebra and the interposed intervertebral disc. The lowest arises from the adjacent margins of the bodies of the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae and the interposed disc. A series of tendinous arches extend across the narrow parts of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae between the digitations already described. The lumbar arteries and veins, and filaments from the sympathetic trunk, pass medial to these arches. The upper four lumbar intervertebral foramina bear important relations to these attachments of the muscle. The foramina lie anterior to the transverse processes and posterior to the attachments to vertebral bodies, intervertebral discs and tendinous arches. Thus, the roots of the lumbar plexus enter the muscle directly, the plexus is lodged within it, and its branches emerge from its borders and surfaces.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0105"><img src="../../IMAGES/B978070207705000077X/main.assets/f77-24-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0105"/><a id="fspara0105"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 77.37</span> The hip flexors and superficial muscles of the thigh, anterior view.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p1195">The muscle descends along the pelvic brim, continues posterior to the inguinal ligament and anterior to the capsule of the hip joint, and converges to a tendon that, having received on its lateral side nearly all the fibres of iliacus, becomes attached to the lesser trochanter of the femur.

In this phase, the body weight tends to make the pelvis sag downwards on the unsupported side. This is counteracted by the gluteus medius and minimus of the supporting side, which, acting from below, exert such powerful traction on the hip bone that the pelvis is actually raised a little on the unsupported side.

Obturator internus differs from obturator externus in its pattern of use but its role in bipedal walking remains unclear. Its attachments suggest that it, like the gemelli, is a lateral rotator of the extended thigh and perhaps an abductor of the flexed thigh.

The presence and position of the femoral neck cause the femoral shaft to lie obliquely; consequently, the anterior muscle group, quadriceps femoris, runs obliquely distally and medially and so applies a pull to the patella that is both laterally and proximally directed. The adductor muscles do not possess a separate compartment limited by fascial planes, but occupy the region between quadriceps femoris and the medial margin of the thigh. They are attached distally to the posterior surface of the femur and lie more posteriorly than quadriceps femoris. The posterior muscle group, the hamstrings, lie behind the adductors. The attachments of these muscles often determine the nature and direction of displacement of femoral shaft fractures.</div><div class="text" id="p1615">The muscles of the three compartments of the thigh are described below.

Rectus femoris helps to flex the thigh on the pelvis; if the thigh is fixed, it helps to flex the pelvis on the thigh. Rectus femoris can flex the hip and extend the knee simultaneously. There is little or no activity in quadriceps femoris during quiet standing, as long as the knee is mechanically locked by action of gravity falling through or in front of the centre of rotation at the knee. Rectus femoris pulls the patella along the line of the mechanical axis of the lower limb (i.e. the line connecting the centres of the hip, knee and ankle). The remaining muscles in the group are attached to the shaft of the femur and their pull (notably the vastus lateralis) is lateral as well as proximal. An important dynamic function of vastus medialis obliquus is to counter this lateral vector on the patella during knee extension.

Inferomedially, the tendinous fibres intermingle to some extent with those of biceps femoris and semitendinosus. The tendon receives, from the ischial tuberosity and ramus, two fibrous expansions that flank adductor magnus. It then broadens and descends deep to semitendinosus and the long head of biceps femoris. Muscle fibres arise from the tendon at about mid-thigh and converge to a second aponeurosis on the posterior aspect of the lower part of the muscle, which tapers to the heavy, rounded tendon of the distal attachment. The tendon divides at the level of the knee into five components. The main one is attached to a tubercle (sometimes called the tuberculum tendinis) on the posterior aspect of the medial tibial condyle. The others are: a series of slips to the medial margin of the tibia, immediately behind the tibial collateral ligament; a thin fibrous expansion to the fascia over popliteus; a cord-like tendon to the inferior lip and adjacent part of the groove on the back of the medial tibial condyle, deep to the tibial collateral ligament; and a strong expansion that passes obliquely upwards to the femoral intercondylar line and lateral femoral condyle, and forms much of the oblique popliteal ligament of the knee joint.</div><div class="text" id="p1995">Semimembranosus varies considerably in size and may be absent.

Its deep surface lies on adductor magnus. The sciatic nerve lies laterally and surprisingly close to the surface. The distal end of the muscle partially overlies the medial head of gastrocnemius before passing anteromedially to it.

The common fibular nerve is found emerging posterior to the biceps femoris tendon, which is a useful guide to locating the nerve and avoiding iatrogenic injury. The nerve is adherent to the tendon; if part of the fibular head or the attachment of the tendon of biceps femoris, usually with the insertion of the fibular collateral ligament, is avulsed, then the tendon will exert proximal traction on the nerve, which may contribute to common fibular nerve traction injury.

Acting from below, they extend the hip joint, pulling the trunk upright from a stooping posture against the influence of gravity. When the knee is semi-flexed, biceps femoris can act as a lateral rotator and semimembranosus and semitendinosus as medial rotators of the lower leg on the thigh at the knee. As is the case with quadriceps femoris, the adductors and gluteus maximus, the hamstrings are typically quiescent in easy symmetrical standing. However, any action that takes the centre of gravity in front of a transverse axis through the hip joints, e.g. forward reaching, forward sway at the ankle joints or forward bending at the hips, is immediately accompanied by strong contraction of the hamstrings. This is in marked contrast to gluteus maximus, which contracts only when there is a call for powerful extension at the hip joint.</div><div class="text" id="p2050">Often, activation of the hamstring muscles occurs in conjunction with simultaneous movements of the hip and the knee. For example, consider rising from a deep squat position by combining simultaneous extension of the hips and knees. In this example, the activated hamstrings are pulling the hips into extension, while they are simultaneously being elongated as they cross the posterior side of the extending knee. Such a biomechanical scenario (which is typical in most biarticular muscles throughout the body) helps maintain an overall muscle length that is conducive to effective force production (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib52" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Neumann 2017</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p2055">When relaxed, these muscles show considerable variation in length; in some individuals, the muscles are so short as to impose a serious limitation on flexion of the trunk at the hip joints when the knees are kept extended. Movements such as stooping must then be accomplished by flexing the vertebral column or squatting. Perhaps the need for more stress on the lumbar spine accounts for the occurrence of hamstring tightness in adolescents who develop spondylolysis. These muscles are prone to tearing, which may be related to the relative complexity of muscles that cross two joints, or to the fact that they are subject to large forces being produced as the muscles are active in an eccentric fashion.</div><section><a id="s1905"/><section><a id="s1910"/><section><a id="s1915"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle1540">Testing</p><div class="textfl" id="p2060">The posterior thigh muscles are tested clinically by active knee flexion against resistance in the supine or prone position. In the prone position, the individual hamstring tendons can be identified more easily. When the knee is flexed against resistance, the tendon of biceps femoris can be felt lateral to the popliteal fossa. Medial to the fossa, the tendons of gracilis (which is the more medial) and semitendinosus stand out sharply. The semimembranosus tendon is just palpable in the interval between them (and also by deep pressure from a ‘pincer’ grip beyond their margins).</div></section></section></section></section></section></section><a id="s1920"/><hgroup><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle1545">Vascular Supply and Lymphatic Drainage</h2><h3 class="h2after1" id="cesectitle1555">Arteries</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle1550">Common iliac and external iliac arteries and veins</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s1930"/><section><a id="s1925"/><div class="textfl" id="p2065">The common iliac and external iliac arteries and veins are described in <a href="../B9780702077050000719/B9780702077050000719.xhtml#c0071">Chapter 71</a>.</div></section><section><a id="s1935"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle1560">Gluteal vessels</h4><div class="textfl" id="p2070">The superior and inferior gluteal arteries (see <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_split_a.xhtml#f0150">Fig. 77.47</a>) are described in <a href="../B9780702077050000719/B9780702077050000719.xhtml#c0071">Chapter 71</a>.</div></section><section><a id="s1940"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle1565">Arteria comitans nervi ischiadici (artery to sciatic nerve)</h4><div class="textfl" id="p2075">The arteria comitans nervi ischiadici is a direct or indirect branch of the internal iliac artery, and runs on the surface of, or within, the sciatic nerve.

The tributary draining the medial malleolar region is formed distally from a fine network or ‘corona’ of delicate veins just over the medial malleolus, and then ascends the medial aspect of the calf as the posterior arch vein. This vein was first illustrated by Leonardo da Vinci, whose name is sometimes given to it. It connects with posterior tibial venae comitantes by a series of perforating (communicating) veins. There are usually three, equally spaced between the medial malleolus and the mid-calf. More than three such perforators are uncommon, and an arch vein perforator above mid-calf is only very rarely found.</div><div class="text" id="p2275">Above the posterior crural arch vein, perforating veins join the long saphenous vein or one of its main tributaries at two main sites.

Some open independently, while others converge to form large named channels that frequently pass towards the basal half of the femoral triangle before joining the long saphenous near its termination. These may be grouped as follows: one or more large posteromedial tributaries, one or more large anterolateral tributaries, and four or more peri-inguinal veins. The posteromedial vein of the thigh, large and sometimes double, drains a large superficial region indicated by its name; it has (as have the other tributaries) radiological and surgical significance. One of its lower radicles is often continuous with the short saphenous vein. The posteromedial vein is sometimes named the accessory saphenous vein, though some restrict the term accessory to a lower (more distal) posteromedial tributary when two (or more) are present. Another large vessel, the anterolateral vein of the thigh (anterior femoral cutaneous vein), usually commences from an anterior network of veins in the distal thigh and crosses the apex and distal half of the femoral triangle to reach the long saphenous vein. As the latter traverses the saphenous opening, it is joined by the superficial epigastric, superficial circumflex iliac and superficial external pudendal veins. Their mode of union varies. Superficial epigastric and circumflex iliac veins drain the inferior abdominal wall, the latter also receiving tributaries from the proximolateral region of the thigh. The superficial epigastric or the femoral vein may connect with the lateral thoracic veins by means of a thoracoepigastric vein that runs superficially on the anterolateral aspect of the trunk. This vein connects the inferior and superior caval areas of drainage and may be dilated and visible in cases of inferior caval obstruction.

As it leaves the pelvis, it passes either below piriformis or sometimes through the muscle, and at that point it may very rarely become entrapped or tethered; the piriformis syndrome is a controversial condition in which an anomalous relationship between piriformis and the sciatic nerve is thought to cause pain in the buttocks and along the course of the sciatic nerve. External compression over the buttock, e.g. in patients who lie immobile on a hard surface for a considerable length of time, can injure the nerve.

It leaves the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen below piriformis and descends under gluteus maximus with the inferior gluteal vessels, lying posterior or medial to the sciatic nerve (see <a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_split_a.xhtml#f0150">Fig. 77.47</a>). It descends in the back of the thigh superficial to the long head of biceps femoris, deep to the fascia lata. It pierces the deep fascia behind the knee and accompanies the short saphenous vein to mid-calf, its terminal twigs connecting with the sural nerve. Its branches are cutaneous and are distributed to the gluteal region, perineum, posterior thigh and proximal posterior leg.</div><div class="text" id="p2475">Three or four gluteal branches (inferior clunial nerves) curl round the lower border of gluteus maximus to supply the skin over the inferolateral portion of the muscle. The perineal branch supplies the superomedial skin in the thigh, curves forwards across the hamstrings below the ischial tuberosity, pierces the fascia lata and then runs in the superficial perineal fascia to the scrotal or labial skin. It communicates with the inferior rectal and posterior scrotal or labial branches of the perineal nerve, and gives numerous branches to the skin of the back and medial side of the thigh, the popliteal fossa and the proximal part of the back of the leg. One study found the perineal branch of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh in about one-half of specimens (<a href="../B978070207705000077X/B978070207705000077X_bib.xhtml#bib71" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_71">Tubbs et al 2009</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s2300"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle1890">Nerve to piriformis</h4><div class="textfl" id="p2480">The nerve to piriformis usually arises from the dorsal branches of the first and second sacral ventral rami (sometimes only the second) and enters the anterior surface of piriformis.</div></section><section><a id="s2305"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle1895">Visceral and pelvic muscular branches of sacral plexus</h4><div class="textfl" id="p2485">Visceral and muscular branches of the sacral plexus are described in <a href="../B9780702077050000719/B9780702077050000719.xhtml#c0071">Chapter 71</a>.</div></section></section></section></body></html>
