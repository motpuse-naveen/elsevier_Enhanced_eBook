&gt;&gt; Narrator: Well, observe her
move, and she moves fairly normally,

00:00:04.056 --> 00:00:09.266 A:middle
but particularly when we want to inspect the
part, we'd inspect for swelling, deformities,

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:12.136 A:middle
muscles, and particularly the
muscles we want to look for,

00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:13.686 A:middle
it's her left shoulder that's troublesome.

00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:15.976 A:middle
And she's got her special
Cincinnati shirt on here.

00:00:16.226 --> 00:00:21.086 A:middle
But we look particularly, if you come in closer
there Steve, at the infraspinatus muscle here,

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:23.066 A:middle
and compare it to the opposite side.

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:27.486 A:middle
And if we compare it to the opposite side, I
think you can appreciate that it doesn't look

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:29.806 A:middle
like there's any obvious infraspinatus swelling.

00:00:30.156 --> 00:00:30.986 A:middle
Come on back again.

00:00:31.276 --> 00:00:35.286 A:middle
And then we look in the supraspinatus
fossa, above here, and again it doesn't look

00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:36.826 A:middle
like there's much swelling on that.

00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:41.106 A:middle
Now the deltoid itself does not get
-- or at least -- I'm sorry -- wasted.

00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:43.696 A:middle
The deltoid itself does not
get wasted, so in fact,

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:45.976 A:middle
she really does not have
manifestations of muscle wasting.

00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:50.726 A:middle
While we're looking at the muscles, we
would ask her to flex her bicep for us,

00:00:50.726 --> 00:00:53.936 A:middle
per chance if she had a disruption,
which she obviously doesn't have.

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:59.066 A:middle
Now in terms of looking at her shoulder, we
want to be sure she doesn't have a deformity

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:03.326 A:middle
of her acromioclavicular joint here,
or any other obvious deformities

00:01:03.326 --> 00:01:04.646 A:middle
about her shoulder, which she doesn't.
