The three elements of the neurone are the soma, the dendrite and the axon. The communication within the neurones is mediated by action potentials. Communication between neurones is mediated mainly by chemical synapses, but electrical synapses are also present. The communication at the synapse involves several neurotransmitters and neurohormones, in particular acetylcholine, monoamines and amino acids. The second cellular constituent of the central nervous system are glial cells – astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia – and a newly described fourth type of glial cell, the NG2 cell. Astrocytes have multiple functions, including providing guiding structures during development, modulating neuronal activity and regulating blood flow. Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system and microglial cells are the immune competent cells of the central nervous system. In the peripheral nervous system Schwann cells are the myelinating cells. Myelin of the central nervous system differs from peripheral myelin with respect to its molecular structure. In the peripheral nervous system a number of specific anatomical structures serve to detect sensory signals. Besides free nerve endings, encapsulated endings such as Pacinian corpuscles or Golgi tendon organs are described.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">action potential; astrocyte; glia; microglia; neurone; neurotransmitter; oligodendrocyte; Schwann cell; synapse</div></section>--><section><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The nervous system has two major divisions, the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain, spinal cord, optic nerve and retina, and contains the majority of neuronal cell bodies. The PNS includes all nervous tissue outside the CNS and consists of the cranial and spinal nerves, the peripheral autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the special senses (taste, olfaction, vision, hearing and balance). It is composed mainly of the axons of sensory and motor neurones that pass between the CNS and the body. The ANS is subdivided into sympathetic and parasympathetic components. It consists of neurones that innervate secretory glands and cardiac and smooth muscle, and is concerned primarily with control of the internal environment. Neurones in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract form the enteric nervous system (ENS) and are capable of sustaining local reflex activity that is independent of the CNS. The ENS contains as many intrinsic neurones in its ganglia as the entire spinal cord and is often considered as a third division of the nervous system (<a href="#bib37" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_37">Gershon 1998</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0015">In the CNS, the cell bodies of neurones are often grouped together in discrete areas termed nuclei, or they may form more extensive layers or masses of cells; collectively they constitute the grey matter. Neuronal dendrites and synaptic contacts are mostly confined to areas of grey matter and form part of its meshwork of neuronal and glial processes, termed the neuropil. Their axons join bundles of nerve fibres that tend to be grouped separately to form tracts. In the spinal cord, cerebellum, cerebral cortices and some other areas, concentrations of tracts constitute the white matter, so called because the axons are often ensheathed in lipid-rich sheaths of myelin, which is white when fresh (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 3.1</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000033/main.assets/on03-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0195"/><a id="fspara0195"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 3.1</span> A section through the human cerebellum stained to show the arrangement of the central white matter (WM, deep pink) and the highly folded outer grey matter (GM).

Sensory cells in dorsal root ganglia give off both centrally and peripherally directed processes; there are no synapses on their cell bodies. Also included are ganglionic neurones of the ANS, which receive synaptic contacts from the peripheral fibres of preganglionic autonomic neurones whose cell bodies lie within the CNS.</div><div class="text" id="p0030">When the neural tube is formed during prenatal development (<a href="#bib103" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_103">Sanes et al 2011</a>), its walls thicken greatly but do not completely obliterate the cavity within. The latter remains in the spinal cord as the narrow central canal and becomes greatly expanded in the brain to form a series of interconnected cavities called the ventricular system. In the fore- and hindbrains, parts of the neural tube roof do not generate neurones but become thin, folded sheets of secretory tissue, which are invaded by blood vessels and are called the choroid plexuses. The latter secrete cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which fills the ventricles and subarachnoid spaces, and penetrates the intercellular spaces of the brain and spinal cord to create their interstitial fluid. The CNS has a rich blood supply, which is essential to sustain its high metabolic rate. The blood–brain barrier places considerable restrictions on the substances that are able to diffuse from the blood stream into the neuropil.</div><div class="text" id="p0035">Neurones encode information, conduct it over considerable distances, and then transmit it to other neurones or to various non-neural targets such as muscle cells. The propagation of this information within the nervous system depends on rapid electrical signals, the action potentials. Transmission to other cells is mediated by secretion of neurotransmitters at special junctions, either with other neurones (synapses), or with cells outside the nervous system, e.g. muscle cells at neuromuscular junctions, gland cells or adipose tissue, and causes changes in the behaviour of the target cells.</div><div class="text" id="p0040">The nervous system contains large populations of non-neuronal cells, termed neuroglia or glia. These cells do not generate action potentials, but convey information encoded as transient changes in intracellular calcium concentration, termed calcium signalling. Glia interact with neurones in many different ways; their two-way communication is essential for normal brain activity.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">It was thought for many years that glia outnumbered neurones by 10 times in the CNS, but studies using the isotropic fractionator method challenged that popular view, suggesting instead that the two cell populations are rather similar in size (<a href="#bib6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_6">Azevedo et al 2009</a>).

Neurones in the PNS are confined to ganglia. Irrespective of location, neurones share many general features, which are discussed here in the context of central neurones. Special characteristics of ganglionic neurones and their adjacent tissues are discussed on <a href="#pg60">p. 60</a>.</div><div class="text" id="p0060">Neurones exhibit great variability in their size (cell bodies range from 5 to 100<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm diameter) and shape (<a href="#bib120" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_120">Spruston 2008</a>). Their surface areas are extensive because most neurones display numerous branched cell processes. They usually have a rounded or polygonal cell body (perikaryon or soma). This is a central mass of cytoplasm that encloses a nucleus and gives off long, branched extensions with which most intercellular contacts are made. Typically, one of these processes, the axon, is much longer than the others, the dendrites (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 3.2</span></a>). Generally, dendrites conduct electrical signals towards a soma and axons conduct impulses away from it.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000033/main.assets/f03-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 3.2</span> A schematic view of typical neurones featuring one with the soma cut away to show the nucleus and cytoplasmic organelles, dendritic trees with synaptic contacts, other types of synapse, the axon hillock and a myelinated axon.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0065">Neurones can be classified according to the number and arrangement of their processes (<a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_14">Bota and Swanson 2007</a>). Multipolar neurones (<a href="#f0020"><span class="bold">Fig. 3.3</span></a>) are common; they have an extensive dendritic tree that arises either from a single primary dendrite or directly from the soma, and a single axon. Bipolar neurones, which typify neurones of the special sensory systems, have only a single dendrite that emerges from the soma <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="44" id="pagebreak_44"/><a id="pg44"/>opposite the axonal pole. Unipolar neurones, which transmit general sensation, e.g. dorsal root ganglion neurones, have a single short process that bifurcates into a peripheral and a central process. This arrangement arises by the fusion of the proximal axonal and dendritic processes of a bipolar neurone during development, and so such neurones can also be termed pseudounipolar. Neurones may also be classified according to whether their axons terminate locally on other neurones (interneurones), or transmit impulses over long distances, often to distinct territories via defined tracts (projection neurones).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0020"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000033/main.assets/f03-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 3.3</span> The variety of shapes of neurones and their processes.

The non-synaptic surface may contain gap junctions and is partly covered by either astrocytic or satellite oligodendrocyte processes.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">The cytoplasm of a typical soma (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 3.2</a>) is rich in rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum and free polyribosomes, indicating a high level of protein synthetic activity. Free polyribosomes often congregate in large groups associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. These aggregates of RNA-rich structures are visible by light microscopy as basophilic Nissl bodies or granules. They are distributed throughout the cell body and large dendrites; the axon hillock is conspicuously ribosome-free. Nissl bodies are more obvious in large, highly active cells, such as spinal motor neurones (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 3.4</span></a>), which contain large stacks of rough endoplasmic reticulum and polyribosome aggregates. Maintenance and turnover of cytoplasmic and membranous components are necessary activities in all cells; the huge total volume of cytoplasm within the soma and processes of many neurones requires a considerable commitment of protein synthetic machinery. Neurones also synthesize other proteins (enzyme systems, G-protein coupled receptors, scaffold proteins) involved in the production of neurotransmitters and in the reception and transduction of incoming stimuli. Various transmembrane channel proteins and enzymes are located at the surfaces of neurones, where they are associated with movements of ions.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0025"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000033/main.assets/f03-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0020"/><a id="fspara0020"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 3.4</span> Spinal motor neurones (toluidine blue stained resin section, rat tissue) showing a group of cell bodies (somata, S), some with the proximal parts of axonal and dendritic processes (P) visible.

Nissl granules (G) are seen in the cytoplasm. Surrounding the neuronal somata is the neuropil, consisting of the interwoven processes of these and other neurones and of glial cells.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0085">The nucleus is characteristically large and euchromatic, and contains at least one prominent nucleolus; these are features typical of all cells engaged in substantial levels of protein synthesis. The cytoplasm contains many mitochondria and moderate numbers of lysosomes. Golgi complexes are usually close to the nucleus, near the bases of the main dendrites and opposite the axon hillock.</div><div class="text" id="p0090">The neuronal cytoskeleton is a prominent feature of its cytoplasm and gives shape, strength and support to the dendrites and axons. A number of neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by abnormal aggregates of cytoskeletal proteins (reviewed in <a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_22">Cairns et al (2004)</a>). Neurofilaments (the intermediate filaments of neurones) and microtubules are abundant in the soma and along dendrites and axons; the proportions vary with the type of neurone and cell process. Bundles of neurofilaments constitute neurofibrils, which can be seen by light microscopy in silver-stained or immunolabelled sections. Neurofilaments are heteropolymers of proteins assembled from three polypeptide subunits, NF-L (68<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>kDa), NF-M (160<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>kDa) and NF-H (200<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>kDa). NF-M and NF-H have long C-terminal domains that project as side arms from the assembled neurofilament and bind to neighbouring filaments. They can be heavily phosphorylated, particularly in the highly stable neurofilaments of mature axons, and are thought to give axons their tensile strength. Some axons are almost filled by neurofilaments.</div><div class="text" id="p0095">Microtubules are important in axonal transport, although dendrites usually have more microtubules than axons. Centrioles persist in mature postmitotic neurones, where they are concerned with the generation of microtubules rather than cell division. Centrioles are associated with cilia on the surfaces of developing neuroblasts. Their significance, other than at some sensory endings (e.g. the olfactory mucosa), is unclear but recent experimental evidence suggests a complex signalling function (<a href="#bib41" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_41">Guemez-Gamboa et al 2014</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0100">Pigment granules (<a href="#f0030"><span class="bold">Fig. 3.5</span></a>) appear in certain regions, e.g. neurones of the substantia nigra contain neuromelanin, which is probably a waste product of catecholamine synthesis. A similar pigment gives a bluish colour to the neurones in the locus coeruleus. Some neurones are unusually rich in metals, which may form components of enzyme systems, e.g. zinc in the hippocampus and iron in the red nucleus. Ageing neurones, especially in spinal ganglia, accumulate granules of lipofuscin (senility pigment) in residual bodies, which are lysosomes packed with partially degraded lipoprotein material.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0030"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000033/main.assets/f03-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0025"/><a id="fspara0025"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 3.5</span> Neurones in the substantia nigra of the human midbrain, showing cytoplasmic granules of neuromelanin pigment. <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Mr Peter Helliwell and the late Dr Joseph Mathew, Department of Histopathology, Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, UK.</span><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="45" id="pagebreak_45"/></figcaption></figure></div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0030">Dendrites</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0105">Dendrites are highly branched, usually short processes that project from the soma (<a href="#bib109" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_109">Shah et al 2010</a>). The branching patterns of many dendritic arrays are probably established by random adhesive interactions between dendritic growth cones and afferent axons that occur during development. There is an overproduction of dendrites in early development, and this is pruned in response to functional demand as the nervous system matures and information is processed through the dendritic tree. There is evidence that dendritic trees may be plastic structures throughout adult life, expanding and contracting as the traffic of synaptic activity varies through afferent axodendritic contacts (see <a href="#bib131" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_131">Wong and Ghosh (2002)</a>). Groups of neurones with similar functions have a similar stereotypic tree structure (<a href="#f0035"><span class="bold">Fig. 3.6</span></a>), suggesting that the branching patterns of dendrites are important determinants of the integration of the afferent inputs that converge on the tree (see <a href="#bib70" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_70">Kulkarni and Firestein (2012)</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0035"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000033/main.assets/f03-05-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0030"/><a id="fspara0030"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 3.6</span> A Purkinje neurone from the cerebellum of a rat stained by the Golgi–Cox method, showing the extensive two-dimensional array of dendrites. <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Dr Martin Sadler and Professor M Berry, Division of Anatomy and Cell Biology, GKT School of Medicine, London.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0110">Dendrites differ from axons in many respects. They represent the afferent rather than the efferent system of the neurone, and receive both excitatory and inhibitory axodendritic contacts. They may also make dendrodendritic and dendrosomatic connections (see <a href="#f0045">Fig. 3.9</a>), some of which are reciprocal. Synapses occur either on small projections called dendritic spines or on the smooth dendritic surface. Dendrites contain ribosomes, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, microtubules, neurofilaments, actin filaments and Golgi complexes. Their neurofilament proteins are poorly phosphorylated and their microtubules are interconnected by the microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-2 almost exclusively in comparison with axons.</div><div class="text" id="p0115">The shapes of dendritic spines range from simple protrusions to structures with a slender stalk and expanded distal end.

Mouse mutants deficient in these organelles show memory deficits (<a href="#bib27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_27">Deller et al 2003</a>). Free ribosomes and polyribosomes are concentrated at the base of the spine. Ribosomal accumulations near synaptic sites provide a mechanism for activity-dependent synaptic plasticity through the local regulation of protein synthesis (see <a href="#bib97" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_97">Petralia et al 2016</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0035">Axons</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0120">The axon originates either from the soma or from the proximal segment of a dendrite at a specialized region free of Nissl granules, the axon hillock. Action potentials are initiated here, at the junction with the proximal axon (axon initial segment) (<a href="#bib73" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_73">Lörincz and Nusser 2010</a>). The axonal plasma membrane (axolemma) is undercoated at the hillock by a concentration of cytoskeletal molecules, including spectrin and actin fibrils, which are important in anchoring numerous voltage-sensitive channels to the membrane (see <a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_10">Bender and Trussell (2012)</a>). The axon hillock is unmyelinated and often participates in inhibitory axo-axonal synapses. It is unique because it contains ribosomal aggregates immediately below the postsynaptic membrane (<a href="#bib68" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_68">Kole and Stuart 2012</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0125">In the CNS, small, unmyelinated axons lie free in the neuropil, whereas in the PNS they are embedded in Schwann cell cytoplasm. Myelin, which is formed around almost all axons of &gt;2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm diameter by oligodendrocytes in the CNS and by Schwann cells in the PNS, begins at the distal end of the axon hillock. Nodes of Ranvier are specialized regions of myelin-free axon where action potentials are generated and where an axon may branch. In both CNS and PNS, the territory of a myelinated axon between adjacent nodes is called an internode; the region close to a node, where the myelin sheath terminates, is called the paranode; and the region just beyond that is the juxtaparanode. Myelin thickness and internodal lengths are, in general, positively correlated with axon diameter. The density of sodium channels in the axolemma is highest at nodes of Ranvier, and very low along internodal membranes; sodium channels are spread more evenly within the axolemma of unmelinated axons. Fast potassium chanels are present in the paranodal regions of myelinated axons. Fine processes of glial cytoplasm (astrocytic in the CNS, Schwann cell in the PNS) surround the nodal axolemma.</div><div class="text" id="p0130">The terminals of an axon are unmyelinated. Most expand into presynaptic boutons, which may form connections with axons, dendrites, neuronal somata or, in the periphery, muscle fibres, glands and lymphoid tissue. Exceptions include the free afferent sensory endings in, for example, the epidermis, which are unspecialized structurally, and the peripheral terminals of afferent sensory fibres with encapsulated endings (see <a href="#f0150">Fig. 3.29</a>). Axon terminals contain abundant small clear synaptic vesicles and large dense-core vesicles. The former contain a neurotransmitter (e.g. glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acetylcholine) that is released into the synaptic cleft on the arrival of an action potential at the terminal and which then binds to cognate receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. Depending on the nature of the transmitter and its receptors, the postsynaptic neurone will become excited or inhibited. The dense-core vesicles contain neuropeptides, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; <a href="#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">Dieni et al 2012</a>). Axon terminals may themselves be contacted by other axons, forming axo-axonal presynaptic inhibitory circuits (<a href="#bib127" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_127">Veres et al 2014</a>, <a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Burke et al 2017</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0135">Axons contain microtubules, neurofilaments, mitochondria, membrane vesicles, cisternae and lysosomes. They do not usually contain ribosomes or Golgi complexes, other than at the axon hillock; exceptionally, the neurosecretory fibres of hypothalamo-hypophysial neurones contain the mRNA of neuropeptides. Organelles are differentially distributed along axons, e.g. there is a greater density of mitochondria and membrane vesicles in the axon hillock, at nodes and in presynaptic endings. Axonal microtubules are interconnected by cross-linking MAPs, of which tau is the most abundant. Microtubules have an intrinsic polarity, and in axons all microtubules are uniformly orientated with their rapidly growing ends directed away from the soma towards the axon terminal. The microtubule binding protein tau plays an important role in Alzheimer’s disease (<a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Cairns et al 2004</a>; <a href="#bib57" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_57">Iqbal et al 2010</a>): formation of tau oligomers and the subsequent pathological filament arrays are critical steps in the aetiopathogenesis of this condition. Neurofilament proteins ranging from high to low molecular weights are highly phosphorylated in mature axons, whereas growing and regenerating axons express a calmodulin-binding membrane-associated phosphoprotein, growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43), as well as poorly phosphorylated neurofilaments. In dendrites, microtubules are the major cytoskeletal element, forming microtubule fascicles associated with filamentous MAPs such as MAP2 and MAP1B (<a href="#bib51" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_51">Hirokawa 1994</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0140">Neurones respond differently to injury, depending on whether the damage occurs in the CNS or the PNS.

Anterograde transport conveys synaptic vesicle precursors, vesicles containing neurotrophic factor receptors and mitochondria. Retrograde transport mediates the movement of neurotropic viruses.

Axodendritic and axosomatic synapses occur in all regions of the CNS and in autonomic ganglia, including those of the ENS.

The submembranous densities may be thicker on the postsynaptic than on the presynaptic side (asymmetric synapses), or equivalent in thickness (symmetric synapses), and can be perforated or non-perforated. Synaptic ribbons are found at sites of neurotransmission in the retina and inner ear. They have a distinctive morphology, in that the synaptic vesicles are grouped around a ribbon- or rod-like density orientated perpendicular to the cell membrane (see <a href="#f0055">Fig. 3.10</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0200">Synaptic boutons make obvious close contacts with postsynaptic structures but many other terminals lack specialized contact zones. Areas of transmitter release occur in the varicosities of unmyelinated axons, where effects are sometimes diffuse, e.g. the aminergic pathways of the basal ganglia, and in autonomic fibres in the periphery. In some instances, such axons may ramify widely throughout extensive areas of the brain and affect the behaviour of very large populations of neurones, e.g. the diffuse cholinergic innervation of the cerebral cortices. Pathological degeneration of these pathways can therefore cause widespread disturbances in neural function.</div><div class="text" id="p0205">Neurones express a variety of neurotransmitters, either as one class of neurotransmitter per cell or more often as several. Good correlations exist between some types of transmitter and specialized structural features of synapses. In general, asymmetric synapses with relatively small spherical vesicles are associated with acetylcholine (ACh), glutamate, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and some amines; those with dense-core vesicles include many peptidergic synapses and other amines (e.g. noradrenaline (norepinephrine), adrenaline (epinephrine), dopamine). Symmetric synapses with flattened or pleomorphic vesicles have been shown to contain either GABA or glycine. Flattening of synaptic vesicles was claimed to be an artefact of aldehyde fixation (<a href="#bib128" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_128">Walberg 1968</a>), but this has not been supported in the subsequent literature. It appears that the shape and orientation of synaptic vesicles may be influenced by their movement toward the active zone of a synapse: a study using adult mouse brain tissue analysed by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) found that synaptic vesicles were not spherical but oblate or cigar-shaped ellipsoids (<a href="#bib65" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_65">Khanmohammadi et al 2015</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0210">Neurosecretory endings found in various parts of the brain and in neuroendocrine glands and cells of the dispersed neuroendocrine system share many features with presynaptic boutons.

The response time in typical fast-acting synapses is then very rapid; classic neurotransmitter (e.g. ACh, glutamate or GABA) is released in less than a millisecond. Release-ready synaptic vesicles are docked to the presynaptic membrane and primed through processes not yet fully understood. On calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive channels, their membranes fuse to open a pore through which neurotransmitter diffuses into the synaptic cleft (<a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Gray 1959</a>, <a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Eggermann et al 2012</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0230">Once the vesicle has discharged its contents, its membrane is incorporated into the presynaptic plasma membrane and is then recycled back into the bouton by endocytosis near the edges of the active zone. The recycling time for a synaptic vesicle may be in the range of a few seconds to minutes; newly recycled vesicles may be used instantly for the next cycle of neurotransmitter release (cycling pool of vesicles). The fusion of vesicles with the presynaptic membrane is responsible for the observed quantal behaviour of neurotransmitter release, both during neural activation and spontaneously, in the slightly leaky resting condition (<a href="#bib83" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_83">Neher and Sakaba 2008</a>, <a href="#bib122" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_122">Suedhof 2012</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0235">Postsynaptic events vary greatly, depending on the receptor molecules and their related molecular complexes (<a href="#bib80" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_80">Murakoshi and Yasuda 2012</a>).

Only a few examples are given here.</div><div class="text" id="p0330">Most of the neuropeptides are classified according to the site where they were first discovered. For example, the gastrointestinal peptides were initially found in the gut wall, and a group that includes releasing hormones, adenohypophysial and neurohypophysial hormones was first associated with the pituitary gland.

Within the CNS, SP is present in several apparently unrelated major pathways, and has been described in the limbic system, basal ganglia, amygdala and hypothalamus. Its known action is prolonged postsynaptic excitation, particularly from nociceptive afferent terminals, which sustains the effects of noxious stimuli.

It also occurs in small dorsal root ganglion cells. Beta-endorphin, leu- and metenkephalins, and the dynorphins belong to a group of peptides called the naturally occurring opiates that possess analgesic properties. They bind to opiate receptors in the brain where, in general, their action seems to be inhibitory. Enkephalins have been localized in many areas of the brain. Their particular localization in the septal nuclei, amygdaloid complex, basal ganglia and hypothalamus suggests that they are important mediators in the limbic system and in the control of endocrine function. They have also been implicated strongly in the central control of pain pathways, because they are found in the peri-aqueductal grey matter of the midbrain, a number of reticular raphe nuclei, the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve and the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord. The enkephalinergic pathways exert an important presynaptic inhibitory action on nociceptive afferents in the spinal cord and brainstem.

After infusion, BrdU is incorporated into dividing precursor cells and can be immunocytochemically detected in neurones in postmortem tissues.

Nodal axolemma is often closely associated with astrocytic processes; their function is unknown.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0090"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000033/main.assets/f03-16-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0085"/><a id="fspara0085"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 3.17</span> A node of Ranvier (N) in the central nervous system of a rat.

There is considerable overlap between the size of the smallest myelinated and the largest unmyelinated axons, and so axonal calibre is unlikely to be the only factor in determining myelination. Moreover, the first axons to become ensheathed ultimately attain larger diameters than those that are ensheathed at a later date. There is a reasonable linear relationship between axon diameter and internodal length and myelin sheath thickness: as the sheath thickens from a few lamellae to up to 200, the axon may also grow from 1 to 15<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm in diameter.

Akt/mTOR (mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin) signalling has emerged as one of the major pathways involved in myelination; it has been implicated in the regulation of several steps during the development of myelinating Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes (<a href="#bib87" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_87">Norrmén and Suter 2013</a>). In the CNS, myelination also depends in part on expression of a protein (Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin homologous, WAVE), which influences the actin cytoskeleton, oligodendrocyte lamellipodia formation and myelination (<a href="#bib67" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_67">Kim et al 2006</a>). The ultrastructural appearance of myelin is usually explained in terms of the spiral wrapping of an extensive, flat glial process (lamellipodium) around an axon, and the subsequent extrusion of cytoplasm from the sheath at all points other than incisures and paranodes. In this way, the compacted external surfaces of the plasma membrane of the ensheathing glial cell are thought to produce the minor dense lines, and the compacted inner cytoplasmic surfaces, the major dense lines, of the mature myelin sheath (<a href="#f0095"><span class="bold">Fig. 3.18</span></a>). These lines, first described in early electron microscope studies of the myelin sheath, correspond to the intraperiod and period lines respectively, defined in X-ray studies of myelin. The inner and outer zones of occlusion of the spiral process are continuous with the minor dense line and are called the inner and outer mesaxons.

Myelin membrane contains protein, lipid and water, which forms at least 20% of the wet weight. It is a relatively lipid-rich membrane and contains 70–80% lipid. All classes of lipid have been found; perhaps not surprisingly, the precise lipid composition of PNS and CNS myelin is different. The major lipid species are cholesterol (the most common single molecule), phospholipids and glycosphingolipids. Minor lipid species include galactosylglycerides, phosphoinositides and gangliosides. The major glycolipids are galactocerebroside and its sulphate ester, sulphatide; these lipids are not unique to myelin but they are present in characteristically high concentrations. CNS and PNS myelin also contain low concentrations of acidic glycolipids, which constitute important antigens in some inflammatory demyelinating states. Gangliosides, which are glycosphingolipids characterized by the presence of sialic acid (<span class="italic">N</span>-acetylneuraminic acid), account for less than 1% of the lipid in myelin.</div><div class="text" id="p0455">A relatively small number of protein species account for the majority of myelin protein. Some of these proteins are common to both PNS and CNS myelin, but others are different. Proteolipid protein (PLP) and its splice variant DM20 are found only in CNS myelin, whereas myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) occur in both. MAG is a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family, and is localized specifically at those regions of the myelin segment where compaction starts: namely, the mesaxons and inner periaxonal membranes, paranodal loops and incisures, in both CNS and PNS sheaths. It is thought to have a functional role in membrane adhesion.</div><div class="text" id="p0460">In the developing CNS, axonal outgrowth precedes the migration of oligodendrocyte precursors, and oligodendrocytes associate with and myelinate axons after their phase of elongation; oligodendrocyte myelin gene expression is not dependent on axon association. In marked contrast, Schwann cells in the developing PNS are associated with axons during the entire phase of axonal growth. Myelination does not occur simultaneously in all parts of the body in late fetal and early postnatal development. White matter tracts and nerves in the periphery have their own specific temporal patterns that relate to their degree of functional maturity.</div><div class="text" id="p0465">Mutations of the major myelin structural proteins have now been recognized in a number of inherited human neurological diseases.

Each cell bears approximately 20 central apical cilia, surrounded by short microvilli. The cells are joined by gap junctions and desmosomes. Beneath them there may be a subependymal (or subventricular) zone, from two to three cells deep, consisting of cells that generally resemble ependymal cells. In rodents, the subventricular zone contains neural progenitor cells, which can give rise to new neurones, but the existence of these stem cells in the adult human brain is controversial (<a href="#bib60" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_60">Kempermann 2011</a>, <a href="#bib102" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_102">Sanai et al 2011</a>). The capillaries beneath the ependymal cells have no fenestrations and few transcytotic vesicles, which is typical of the CNS. Where the ependyma overlies myelinated tracts of white matter, the cells are much flatter and few are ciliated. There are gap junctions and desmosomes between these cells, but their lateral margins interdigitate, unlike their counterparts overlying grey matter. No subependymal zone is present.</div><div class="text" id="p0480">Specialized areas of ependymal cells called the circumventricular organs are found in four areas around the margins of the third ventricle: namely, the lining of the median eminence of the hypothalamus; the subcommissural organ; the subfornical organ; and the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis. The area postrema, at the inferoposterior limit of the fourth ventricle, has a similar structure. In all of these sites the ependymal cells are only rarely ciliated and their ventricular surfaces bear many microvilli and apical blebs. They have numerous mitochondria, well-formed Golgi complexes and rather flattened basal nuclei. They are joined laterally by tight junctions, which form a barrier to the passage of materials across the ependyma, and by desmosomes. Many of the cells are tanycytes (ependymal astrocytes) and have basal processes that project into the perivascular space surrounding the underlying capillaries. Significantly, these capillaries are fenestrated and therefore do not form a blood–brain barrier. It is believed that neuropeptides can pass from nervous tissue into the CSF by active transport through the ependymal cells in these specialized areas, and so access a wide population of neurones via the permeable ependymal lining of the rest of the ventricle.</div><div class="text" id="p0485">The ependyma is highly modified where it lies adjacent to the vascular layer of the choroid plexuses.</div><section><a id="s0150"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0160">Motile cilia</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0490">Ependymal cells generate unidirectional flow in CSF by beating their motile cilia in a coordinated, whip-like manner.

Activated, but not resting, lymphocytes pass through the endothelium of small venules, a process that requires the expression of recognition and adhesion molecules (induced following cytokine activation), and subsequently migrate into the brain parenchyma.

However, it has the typical structural and functional properties of a peripheral axon, and is conventionally described as an axon.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0130"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000033/main.assets/f03-24-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0125"/><a id="fspara0125"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 3.25</span> Sensory neurones in a dorsal root ganglion (rat).

Unlike astrocytes, SGCs completely surround individual sensory neurones (and more rarely two or three neurones) in a glial sheath.

Diagnostic signs are severe pain, erythema and blistering as occurs in chickenpox, often confined to one of the divisions of the trigeminal nerve or to a spinal nerve dermatome. Herpes zoster involving the geniculate ganglion compresses the facial nerve and results in a lower motor neurone facial paralysis, known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

There is considerable variation in the ratio of pre- and postganglionic fibres in different types of ganglion. Preganglionic sympathetic axons may synapse with many postganglionic neurones for the wide dissemination and perhaps amplification of sympathetic activity, a feature not found to the same degree in parasympathetic ganglia. Dissemination may also be achieved by connections with ganglionic interneurones or by the diffusion within the ganglion of transmitter substances produced either locally (paracrine effect) or elsewhere (endocrine effect). Some axons within a ganglion may be efferent fibres en route to another ganglion, or afferents from viscera and glands.

It is slower and the induced responses are less localized, because the secretions, e.g. neuromediators, can act either on contiguous cells, or on groups of nearby cells reached by diffusion, or on distant cells via the blood stream. Many of its effector molecules operate in both the nervous system and the neuroendocrine system.

When activated, this type of receptor excites its neurone by neurotransmission across a synaptic gap.</div><div class="text" id="p0810">A neuronal receptor is a primary sensory neurone that has a soma in a craniospinal ganglion and a peripheral axon ending in a sensory terminal. All cutaneous sensors and proprioceptors are of this type; their sensory terminals may be encapsulated or linked to special mesodermal or ectodermal structures to form a part of the sensory apparatus. The extraneural cells are not necessarily excitable, but create an appropriate environment for the excitation of the neuronal process.</div><div class="text" id="p0815">The receptor stimulus is transduced into a graded change of electrical potential at the receptor surface (receptor potential), and this initiates an all-or-none action potential that is transmitted to the CNS. This may occur either in the receptor, when this is a neurone, or partly in the receptor and partly in the neurone that innervates it, in the case of epithelial receptors. Transduction varies with the modality of the stimulus, and usually causes depolarization of the receptor membrane (or hyperpolarization, in the retina). In mechanoreceptors, transduction may involve the deformation of membrane structure, which causes either strain or stretch-sensitive ion channels to open. In chemoreceptors, receptor action may resemble that for ACh at neuromuscular junctions. Visual receptors share similarities with chemoreceptors: light causes changes in receptor proteins, which activate G proteins, resulting in the release of second messengers and altered membrane permeability.</div><div class="text" id="p0820">The quantitative responses of sensory endings to stimuli vary greatly and increase the flexibility of the functional design of sensory systems. Although increased excitation with increasing stimulus level is a common pattern (‘on’ response), some receptors respond to decreased stimulation (‘off’ response). Even unstimulated receptors show varying degrees of spontaneous background activity against which an increase or decrease in activity occurs with changing levels of stimulus. In all receptors studied, when stimulation is maintained at a steady level, there is an initial burst (the dynamic phase) followed by a gradual adaptation to steady level (the static phase). Though all receptors show these two phases, one or other may predominate, providing a distinction between rapidly adapting endings that accurately record the rate of stimulus onset, and slowly adapting endings that signal the constant amplitude of a stimulus, e.g. position sense. Dynamic and static phases are reflected in the amplitude and duration of the receptor potential and also in the frequency of action potentials in the sensory fibres. The stimulus strength necessary to elicit a response in a receptor, i.e. its threshold level, varies greatly between receptors, and provides an extra level of information about stimulus strength.

Nerve terminals are found in the layers of visceral walls and the adventitia of blood vessels, but the detailed structure and function of many of these endings are not well established. Encapsulated (lamellated) endings occur in the heart, adventitia and mesenteries. Free terminal arborizations occur in the endocardium, the endomysium of all muscles, and connective tissue generally. Tension produced by excessive muscular contraction or by visceral distension often causes pain, particularly in pathological states, which is frequently poorly localized and of a deep-seated nature.

When afferent axons are myelinated, their terminal arborizations lack a myelin sheath. These terminals serve several sensory modalities. In the dermis, they may be responsive to moderate cold or heat (thermoreceptors); light mechanical touch (mechanoreceptors); damaging heat, cold or deformation (unimodal nociceptors); and damaging stimuli of several kinds (polymodal nociceptors).

In nuclear bag fibres, an equatorial cluster of nuclei makes the fibre bulge slightly, whereas the nuclei in nuclear chain fibres form a single axial row. Nuclear bag fibres are subdivided into bag1 and bag2 fibres, are greater in diameter than chain fibres and extend beyond the surrounding capsule to the endomysium of nearby extrafusal muscle fibres. Nuclear chain fibres are attached at their poles to the capsule or to the sheaths of nuclear bag fibres.</div><div class="text" id="p0915">The intrafusal fibres resemble typical skeletal muscle fibres, except that the zone of myofibrils is thin around the nuclei. Dynamic bag1 fibres generally lack M lines, possess little sarcoplasmic reticulum, and have an abundance of mitochondria and oxidative enzymes, but little glycogen. Static bag2 fibres have distinct M lines and abundant glycogen. Nuclear chain fibres have marked M lines, sarcoplasmic reticulum and T-tubules, and abundant glycogen, but few mitochondria. Each <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="66" id="pagebreak_66"/><a id="pg66"/>fibre type carries distinct myosin heavy chain isoforms. These variations reflect the contractile properties of different intrafusal fibres.</div><div class="text" id="p0920">Muscle spindles receive two types of sensory innervation via the unmyelinated terminations of large myelinated axons. Primary (anulospiral) endings are equatorially placed and form spirals around the nucleated parts of intrafusal fibres. They are the endings of large sensory fibres (group Ia afferents), each of which sends branches to a number of intrafusal muscle fibres. Each terminal lies in a deep sarcolemmal groove in the spindle plasma membrane beneath its basal lamina. Secondary (flower spray) endings, which may be spray-shaped or anular, are largely confined to bag2 and nuclear chain fibres, and are the branched terminals of somewhat thinner myelinated (group II) afferents. They are varicose and spread in a narrow band on both sides of the primary endings. They lie close to the sarcolemma, though not in grooves. In essence, primary endings are rapidly adapting, while secondary endings have a regular, slowly adapting response to static stretch.</div><div class="text" id="p0925">There are three types of motor endings in muscle spindles. Two are from fine, myelinated, fusimotor (γ) efferents and one is from myelinated (β) efferent collaterals of axons that supply extrafusal slow twitch muscle fibres. The fusimotor efferents terminate nearer the equatorial region, where their terminals either resemble the motor end-plates of extrafusal fibres (plate endings) or are more diffuse (trail endings). Stimulation of the fusimotor and β-efferents causes contraction of the intrafusal fibres and, consequently, activation of their sensory endings.</div><div class="text" id="p0930">Muscle spindles signal the length of extrafusal muscle both at rest and throughout contraction and relaxation, the velocity of their contraction and changes in velocity. These modalities may be related to the different behaviours of the three major types of intrafusal fibre and their sensory terminals. The sensory fusimotor endings of one type of nuclear bag fibre (dynamic bag1) are particularly concerned with signalling rapid changes in length that occur during movement, whilst those of the second bag fibre type (static bag2) and of chain fibres are less responsive to movement. These elements can therefore detect complex changes in the state of the extrafusal muscle surrounding spindles and can signal fluctuations in length, tension, velocity of length change and acceleration. Moreover, they are under complex central control; efferent (fusimotor) nerve fibres, by regulating the strength of contraction, can adjust the length of the intrafusal fibres and thereby the responsiveness of spindle sensory endings. In summary, the organization of spindles allows them to monitor muscle conditions actively in order to compare intended and actual movements, and to provide a detailed input to spinal, cerebellar, extrapyramidal and cortical centres about the state of the locomotor apparatus.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0350"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0355">Joint receptors</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0935">The arrays of receptors situated in and near articular capsules provide information on the position, movements and stresses acting on joints.

They lie in the superficial layers of the fibrous capsules of joints in small clusters and are innervated by myelinated afferent axons. Being slowly adapting, they provide awareness of joint position and movement, and respond to patterns of stress in articular capsules. They are particularly common in joints where static positional sense is necessary for the control of posture (e.g. hip, knee).</div><div class="text" id="p0945">Type II endings are lamellated receptors and resemble small versions of the large Pacinian corpuscles found in general connective tissue. They occur in small groups throughout joint capsules, particularly in the deeper layers and other articular structures (e.g. the fat pad of the temporomandibular joint). They are rapidly adapting, low-threshold mechanoreceptors, sensitive to movement and pressure changes, and they respond to joint movement and transient stresses in the joint capsule. They are supplied by myelinated afferent axons but are probably not involved in the conscious awareness of joint sensation.</div><div class="text" id="p0950">Type III endings are identical to Golgi tendon organs in structure and function; they occur in articular ligaments but not in joint capsules.

They are innervated by large myelinated afferent axons.</div><div class="text" id="p0955">Type IV endings are free terminals of myelinated and unmyelinated axons that ramify in articular capsules and the adjacent fat pads, and around the blood vessels of the synovial layer.

In the latter type, the axon gives off numerous branches that form a cluster of small expansions extending along the muscle fibre; in the absence of propagated muscle excitation, these excite the fibre at several points.

Clustering of ACh receptors at the neuromuscular junction depends in part on the presence in the muscle basal lamina of agrin, which is secreted by the motor neurone, and is important in establishing the postjunctional molecular machinery. When the depolarization of the sarcolemma reaches a particular threshold, it initiates an action potential in the sarcolemma, which is then propagated rapidly over the whole cell surface and also deep within the fibre via the invaginations (T-tubules) of the sarcolemma, causing contraction. The amount of ACh released by the arrival of a single nerve impulse is sufficient to trigger an action potential. However, because ACh is very rapidly hydrolysed by the enzyme AChE, present at the sarcolemmal surface of the sole plate, a single nerve impulse only gives rise to one muscle action potential, i.e. there is a one-to-one relationship between neuronal and muscle action potentials.

Cholinergic terminals, which are typical of all parasympathetic and some sympathetic endings, contain clear spherical vesicles like those in the motor end-plates of skeletal muscle. A third category of autonomic neurones has non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic endings that contain a wide variety of chemicals with transmitter properties. ATP is a neurotransmitter at these terminals, which express purinergic receptors (<a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Burnstock et al 2011</a>). The axons typically contain large, 80–200 nm, dense opaque vesicles, congregated in varicosities at intervals along their length. These terminals are formed in many sites, including the lungs, blood vessel walls, the urogenital tract and the external muscle layers and sphincters of the gastrointestinal tract. In the intestinal wall, neuronal somata lie in the myenteric plexus, and their axons spread caudally for a few millimetres, mainly to innervate circular muscle. Purinergic neurones are under cholinergic control from preganglionic sympathetic neurones. Their endings mainly hyperpolarize smooth muscle cells, causing relaxation, e.g. preceding peristaltic waves, opening sphincters and, probably, causing reflex distension in gastric filling. Autonomic efferents innervate exocrine glands, myoepithelial cells, adipose tissue (noradrenaline (norepinephrine) released from postganglionic sympathetic axons binds to β<sub>3</sub>-receptors on adipocytes to stimulate lipolysis) and the vasculature and parenchymal fields of lymphocytes and associated cells in several lymphoid organs, including the thymus, spleen and lymph nodes.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0370"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0375">CNS–PNS Transition Zone</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0995">The transition between CNS and PNS usually occurs some distance from the point at which nerve roots emerge from the brain or the spinal cord. The segment of root that contains components of both CNS and PNS tissue is called the CNS–PNS transition zone (TZ; Redlich–Obersteiner’s zone). All axons in the PNS, other than postganglionic autonomic neurones, cross such a TZ. Macroscopically, as a nerve root is traced towards the spinal cord or the brain, it splits into several thinner rootlets that may, in turn, subdivide into minirootlets. The TZ is located within either rootlet or minirootlet (<a href="#f0190"><span class="bold">Fig. 3.37</span></a>). The arrangement of roots and rootlets varies according to whether the root trunk is ventral, dorsal or cranial.

This potential is generated by an uneven distribution of potassium ions across the membrane (higher in the intracellular compartment than in the extracellular compartment), and by a selective permeability of the membrane for potassium (<a href="#f0195"><span class="bold">Fig. 3.38</span></a>). The distribution of sodium ions is opposite to that for potassium ions, but at rest the sodium conductance of the membrane is low.

Non-excitable cells have an even higher membrane potential. Neurones receive, conduct and transmit information by changes in membrane conductance for sodium, potassium, calcium or chloride ions. Increase in the sodium or calcium conductance causes an influx of these ions and results in a depolarization of the cell, while chloride influx or potassium efflux results in hyperpolarization. Plasma membrane permeability to these ions is altered by the opening or closing of ion-specific transmembrane channels, triggered by voltage changes or chemical signals such as transmitters (<a href="#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_24">Catterall 2010</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0195"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000033/main.assets/f03-37-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0190"/><a id="fspara0190"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 3.38</span> The types of change in electrical potential that can be recorded across the cell membrane of a motor neurone at the points indicated.

Electrically induced changes in membrane potential depend on the presence of voltage-sensitive ion channels, which, when the transmembrane potential reaches a critical level, open to allow the influx or efflux of specific ions. In all cases, the channels remain open only transiently, and the numbers that open and close determine the total flux of ions across the membrane (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Bezanilla 2008</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p1020">The types and concentrations of transmembrane channels and related proteins, and therefore the electrical activity of the membranes, vary in different parts of the cell. Dendrites and neuronal somata depend mainly on neurotransmitter action and show graded potentials, whereas axons have voltage-gated channels that give rise to action potentials.</div><div class="text" id="p1025">In graded potentials, a flow of current occurs when a synapse is activated; the influence of an individual synapse on the membrane potential of neighbouring regions decreases with distance. Thus synapses on the distal tips of dendrites may, on their own, have relatively little effect on the membrane potential of the cell body. The electrical state of a neurone therefore depends on many factors, including the numbers and positions of thousands of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, their <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="69" id="pagebreak_69"/><a id="pg69"/>degree of activation, and the branching pattern of the dendritic tree and geometry of the cell body. The integrated activity directed towards the neuronal cell body is converted to an output directed away from the soma at the site where the axon leaves the cell body, at its junction with the axon hillock. Voltage-sensitive channels are concentrated at this trigger zone, the axon initial segment, and when this region is sufficiently depolarized, an action potential is generated and is subsequently conducted along the axon.</div><section><a id="s0380"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0385">Action potential</h3><div class="textfl" id="p1030">The action potential is a brief, self-propagating reversal of membrane polarity.

Once the axon hillock reaches threshold, propagation of the action potential is independent of the initiating stimulus; thus the size and duration of action potentials are always the same (described as all-or-none) for a particular neurone, no matter how much a stimulus may exceed the threshold value.</div><div class="text" id="p1035">Once initiated, an action potential spreads spontaneously and at a relatively constant velocity, within the range of 4–120<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>m/s. Conduction velocity depends on a number of factors related to the way in which the current spreads, e.g. axonal cross-sectional area, the numbers and positioning of ion channels, and membrane capacitance (influenced particularly by the presence of myelin). In axons lacking myelin, action potential conduction is analogous to a flame moving along a fuse. Just as each segment of fuse is ignited by its upstream neighbour, each segment of axon membrane is driven to threshold by the depolarization of neighbouring membrane. Sodium channels within the newly depolarized segment open and positively charged sodium ions enter, driving the local potential inside the axon towards positive values. This inward current in turn depolarizes the neighbouring, downstream, non-depolarized membrane, and the cyclic propagation of the action potential is completed. Several milliseconds after the action potential, the sodium channels are inactivated, a period known as the refractory period. The length of the refractory period determines the maximum frequency at which action potentials can be conducted along a nerve fibre; it varies in different neurones and affects the amount of information that can be carried by an individual fibre.</div><div class="text" id="p1040">Myelinated fibres are electrically insulated by their myelin sheaths along most of their lengths, except at nodes of Ranvier. The distance between nodes, referred to as the internodal distance, is directly related to axon diameter and varies between 0.2 and 2.0<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm. Voltage-gated sodium channels are clustered at nodes, and the nodal membrane is the only place where high densities of inward sodium current can be generated across the axon membrane. Conduction in myelinated axons is self-propagating, but instead of physically adjacent regions of membrane acting to excite one another (as occurs along unmyelinated axons), it is the depolarization occurring in the neighbouring upstream node that excites a node to threshold. Reaching threshold causes the sodium channels at the node to open and generate inward sodium current, but instead of this acting on the adjacent membrane, the high resistance and low capacitance of the myelin sheath directs the current towards the next downstream node, exciting it to threshold and completing the cycle. The action potential thus jumps from node to node, a process known as saltatory conduction, which greatly increases the conduction velocity.</div><div class="text" id="p1045">A number of disorders of the CNS and PNS include demyelination as a characteristic feature (<a href="#bib4" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_4">Arancibia-Carcamo and Attwell 2014</a>). Perhaps most common amongst these is multiple sclerosis, which is characterized <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="70" id="pagebreak_70"/><a id="pg70"/>by primary demyelination at scattered sites within the CNS (it is now recognized that axonal loss also contributes to the progression of multiple sclerosis). Primary demyelination is the loss of the myelin sheath with axonal preservation, and is usually segmental, i.e. it rarely extends along the entire length of an affected axon. The phenomenon is associated with conduction block because the newly exposed, previously internodal, axolemma contains relatively few voltage-sensitive sodium channels. There is experimental and clinical evidence that remyelinated axons can conduct at near-normal speeds, because even though their sheaths are thinner than the original myelin sheaths, the safety factor (i.e. the factor by which the outward current at a quiescent node next to an excited node exceeds the minimum current required to evoke a response) is greater than 1. The myelin loss that occurs in the early stages of Wallerian degeneration in both CNS and PNS, usually distal to a site of trauma but also in response to a prolonged period of ischaemia or exposure to a neuronotoxic substance, is accompanied by axonal degeneration (the term secondary demyelination is sometimes used to describe this form of myelin loss) (see <a href="../B9780702077050000872/B9780702077050000872.xhtml">Commentary 1.5</a><span class="icon1"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000033/main.assets/icon03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="icon"/></span>).</div><div class="text" id="p1050">Axonal conduction is naturally unidirectional, from dendrites and soma to axon terminals. When an action potential reaches the axonal terminals, it causes depolarization of the presynaptic membrane, and as a result, quanta of neurotransmitter (which correspond to the content of individual vesicles) are released to change the degree of excitation of the next neurone, muscle fibre or glandular cell.</div></section></section></section><footer><span role="doc-pagebreak"

<p id="B978-0-323-37482-8.00290-7#p0130">Although an autoimmune causation for OMS has not been proven, the evidence for the theory is becoming quite compelling. The culprit may be ectopic expression of a neuronal antigen in the periphery,<sup>50</sup> engaging the adaptive immune subsystem and allowing transmigration of activated lymphocytes into the CNS. In recent years, antigen–antibody interactions have been demonstrated in several paraneoplastic disorders. If the analogy to OMS holds, then OMS is characterized by neuroantigen-driven autoimmune events. However, despite much searching, the antigen remains at large; there is also the possibility of multiple antigens given the pleotropic clinical features.</p>
<p id="B978-0-323-37482-8.00290-7#p0135">The location includes the posterior fossa (cerebellum and brainstem), especially the cerebellar vermis,<sup>51,52</sup> and possibly supratentorial structures (cerebral cortex).<sup>53,54</sup> The brainstem localization of saccadic generators supports the “brainstem hypothesis of opsoclonus”.<sup>55</sup> In contrast, brainstem neighborhood signs are usually absent, and late cerebellar (rather than brainstem) atrophy may be found,<sup>54</sup> causing some to speculate that the origination of OMS is the cerebellar fastigial nucleus, consistent with the “cerebellar hypothesis” (see review in<sup>56</sup>). In contrast, the immune system seems not to attack other major organs. A simplistic schema of possible pathophysiologic events in OMS is shown in Figure 120-4. Detailed expositions on the CNS immune response in other neuroinflammatory disorders can be found elsewhere.<sup>57,58</sup></p>

<section><a id="s0375b"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0380b">Overview of Ion Channels</h2>
 <p id="B978-0-323-37482-8.00233-6#p0055">The key channels and receptors involved in normal and epileptic firing are summarized in Fig. 63-3 and Table 63-2. Two major types of ion channels—voltage-gated and ligand-gated—are responsible for inhibitory and excitatory activity. Voltage-gated channels include sodium and calcium channels that depolarize the cell membrane toward the action potential threshold, and potassium channels that dampen neural excitation. Voltage-gated channels are activated by membrane potential changes that alter the conformational state of the channel and allow selective passage of charged ions through a pore. Ligand-gated channels are activated when a neurotransmitter (e.g., glutamate, GABA) is released from a presynaptic terminal into the synaptic cleft and then binds with selective affinity to a membrane-bound receptor on the postsynaptic membrane. This binding activates a cascade of events, including a conformational shift to reveal an ion-permeant pore. Passage of ions across these channels results in depolarization (i.e., inward flux of cations) or hyperpolarization (i.e., inward flux of anions or outward flux of cations). Ion channel mutations underlie several epilepsy syndromes, giving rise to the concept of “epilepsy channelopathie”.<sup>9,10</sup></p>
<div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010ab"><iframe src="../../widgets/Labels/xhtml/Labels.xhtml" height="600"></iframe><figcaption class="figleg"><span class="fignum">Fig. 63.3</span> <b>Normal neuronal firing.</b> Schematic shows a neuron with one excitatory (E) and one inhibitory (I) input. Right trace shows membrane potential (in millivolts [mV]), beginning at a typical resting potential (&#226;ˆ70 mV). Activation of E leads to graded excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), the larger of which reaches threshold (approximately &#226;ˆ40 mV) for an action potential. The action potential is followed by an after-hyperpolarization (AHP), the magnitude and duration of which determine when the next action potential can occur. Activation of I causes an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). The inset shows a magnified portion of the neuronal membrane as a lipid bilayer with interposed voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels; the direction of ion fluxes during excitatory activation is indicated. After firing, the membrane-bound Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> pump and star-shaped astroglial cells restore ionic balance.</figcaption></figure></div></section>

             <b>Answer: B</b> Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is caused by a gastrin-producing endocrine tumor, which is usually in the pancreas or small bowel and leads to marked hyperacidity. This syndrome usually gives rise to severe peptic ulcer disease with multiple, concomitant duodenal ulcers that are resistant to conventional acid suppressive therapy. The other conditions listed are not known to be associated with an increased risk for peptic ulcer.

             <b>Answer: C</b> Over-the-counter NSAID use is very common, in particularly in elderly patients. Patients often do not recognize that they use NSAIDs even when specifically asked. Targeted questioning and checking of home medication is therefore indicated. In some series, surreptitious use of NSAIDs or aspirin was found as the underlying cause in 30 to 60% of patients with previously unexplained peptic ulcer.

             <i>H. pylori</i>−related ulcers have considerably decreased in developed countries owing to a decrease in the declining prevalence of the bacterium in recent generations and the use of eradication therapy. ICU-related stress ulcers have become less common owing to improvements in overall management, including respiratory and hemodynamic care, acid inhibition, and emphasis on adequate feeding. NSAID use has become more common and has given rise to an increase of NSAID-related ulcer disease.

             <b>Answer: E</b> Peptic ulcer is more common in men and in elderly people. Anti-TNF-α treatment is not causally related to peptic ulcer disease, and most patients with peptic ulcers do not develop gastric cancer. In <i>H. pylori</i>−positive subjects, however, smoking increases the risk for peptic ulceration. This increased relative risk has been reported to be up to 12-fold.

             <b>Answer: D</b> In vitamin B <sub>12</sub> deficiency with pernicious anemia, gastric atrophy is caused by an autoimmune gastritis. However, this inflammation is not associated with peptic ulcer disease. Autoimmune inflammation of the small bowel due to celiac disease also does not cause ulceration. Various infectious conditions can give rise to peptic ulcer, but cryptococcosis is not one of them. Systemic vasculitides can be associated with peptic ulcers, but they are not a common presenting manifestation of scleroderma. Systemic mastocytosis is, however, associated with a clearly increased risk for peptic ulceration.

             <b>Answer: E</b> In patients with peptic ulcer bleeding, endoscopic treatment is the mainstay to stop ongoing bleeding and reduce the risk for rebleeding. Preemptive PPI therapy reduces the need for endoscopic treatment, but it has no effect on rebleeding and mortality. High-dose continuous intravenous PPI treatment reduces the risk for rebleeding, the need for blood transfusion, and mortality in patients with a high risk for rebleeding. The Blatchford scale can be used to predict the need for intervention, such as endoscopic treatment and blood transfusion; a low score is associated with a low chance that an intervention is needed. Patients with recurrent bleeding despite endoscopic and PPI treatment can often first be retreated endoscopically. If this retreatment fails, both angiographic embolization of the feeding vessel and surgery are alternative rescue treatments. Recurrent bleeding is thus not a routine indication for surgery.

                  The preceding discussion has emphasized the structure of the gene and the <i>cis</i>-acting elements that regulate gene expression. We now turn to the proteins that interact with these DNA elements and thus regulate gene transcription. Because the basal transcriptional machinery—Pol II and the general transcription factors—is incapable of efficient gene transcription alone, additional proteins are required to stimulate the activity of the enzyme complex. The additional proteins include transcription factors that recognize and bind to specific DNA sequences (enhancers) located near their target genes, as well as others (see  
              <span class="dropdown def-img" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="tooltip" data-dfn="l1" /> 
                  <a href="#page-tab83" aria-label="Coactivators and corepressors" class="link-inline">pp. 83–84</a>) that do not bind to DNA.
               </p>
               
<p>Examples of <b>DNA-binding transcription factors</b> are shown in <a href="#table-tab" class="link-inline">Table 4-1</a>. The general mechanism of action of a specific transcription factor is depicted in  <a href="#" class="link-inline">Figure 4-6<i style="color: rgb(0, 107, 178);">B</i></a>. After the basal transcriptional machinery assembles on the gene promoter, it can interact with a transcription factor that binds to a specific DNA element, the enhancer (or silencer). Looping out of the intervening DNA permits physical interaction between the activator (or repressor) and the basal transcriptional machinery, which subsequently leads to stimulation (or inhibition) of gene transcription. The specificity with which transcription factors bind to DNA depends on the interactions between the amino-acid side chains of the transcription factor and the purine and pyrimidine bases in DNA. Most of these interactions consist of noncovalent hydrogen bonds between amino acids and DNA bases. A peptide capable of a specific pattern of hydrogen bonding can recognize and bind to the reciprocal pattern in the major (and to a lesser extent the minor) groove of DNA. Interaction with the DNA backbone may also occur and involves electrostatic interactions (salt bridge formation) with anionic phosphate groups. The site that a transcription factor recognizes
			   (see <a href="#table-tab" class="link-inline">Table 4-1</a>
                  ) is generally short, usually less than a dozen or so base pairs.

<p>DNA-binding transcription factors do not recognize single, unique DNA sequences; rather, they recognize a <i>family</i> of closely related sequences. For example, the transcription factor AP-1 (activator protein 1) recognizes the sequences

<p>and so on, as well as each of the complementary sequences. That is, some <i>redundancy</i> is usually built into the recognition sequence for a transcription factor. An important consequence of these properties is that the recognition site for a transcription factor may occur many times in the genome. For example, if a transcription factor recognizes a 6-bp sequence, the sequence would be expected to occur once every 4<sup>6</sup> (or  <span aria-label="4,0,9,6,7)"> 4096)</span> base pairs, that is, <span aria-label="seven multiply by 10 power of 5 for 7 × 105 ">7 × 10<sup>5</sup></span> times in the human genome. If redundancy is permitted, recognition sites will occur even more frequently. Of course, most of these sites will not be relevant to gene regulation but will instead have occurred simply by chance. This high frequency of recognition sites leads to an important concept: <i>transcription factors act in combination.</i> Thus, high-level expression of a gene requires that a combination of multiple transcription factors bind to multiple regulatory elements. Although it is complicated, this system ensures that transcription activation occurs only at appropriate locations. Moreover, this system permits greater fine-tuning of the system, inasmuch as the activity of individual transcription factors can be altered to modulate the overall level of transcription of a gene.</p>

 <p>An important general feature of DNA-binding transcription factors is their <b>modular</b> construction (<a href="#" class="link-inline">Fig. 4-8<i>A</i></a>). Transcription factors may be divided into discrete domains that bind DNA (DNA-binding domains) and domains that activate transcription (transactivation domains). <span class="dropdown def-img text-highlighter" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="tooltip" title="n4-6"  data-dfn="l3">Grouping of Transcription Factors According to Transactivation Domain </span> This property was first directly demonstrated for a yeast transcription factor known as GAL4, which activates certain genes when yeast grows in galactose-containing media. GAL4 has two domains. One is a so-called zinc finger (see <dfn title="ch04-82a"> </dfn><a href="#" class="link-inline">p. 82</a>) that mediates sequence-specific binding to DNA. The other domain is enriched in acidic amino acids (i.e., glutamate and aspartate) and is necessary for transcriptional activation. This “acidic blob” domain of GAL4 can be removed and replaced with the transactivation domain from a different transcription factor VP16 (see <a href="#" class="link-inline">Fig. 4-8<i>B</i></a>). The resulting GAL4-VP16 chimera binds to the same DNA sequence as normal GAL4 but mediates transcriptional activation via the VP16 transactivation domain. This type of “domain-swapping” experiment indicates that transcription factors have a modular construction in which physically distinct domains mediate binding to DNA and transcriptional activation (or repression).</p>
               
<h3>Basic Zipper</h3>
               
<p>Also known as the leucine zipper family, the basic zipper (bZIP) family consists of transcription factors that bind to DNA as dimers (see 
                  <a href="#" class="link-inline">Fig. 4-9<i style="color: rgb(0, 107, 178);">B</i></a>). Members include C/EBP<span class="text-serif">β</span> (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-<span class="text-serif">β</span>), c-Fos, c-Jun, and CREB. Each monomer consist of two domains, a basic region that contacts DNA and a leucine zipper region that mediates dimerization. The basic region contains about 30 amino acids and is enriched in arginine and lysine residues. This region is responsible for sequence-specific binding to DNA via an <span class="text-serif">α</span> helix that inserts into the major groove of DNA. The leucine zipper consists of a region of about 30 amino acids in which every seventh residue is a leucine. Because of this spacing, the leucine residues align on a common face every second turn of an <span class="text-serif">α</span> helix. Two protein subunits that both contain leucine zippers can associate because of hydrophobic interactions between the leucine side chains; they form a tertiary structure called a <i>coiled coil.</i> Proteins of this family interact with DNA as <i>homo</i>dimers or as structurally related <i>hetero</i>dimers. Dimerization is essential for transcriptional activity because mutations of the leucine residues abolish both dimer formation and the ability to bind DNA and activate transcription. The crystal structure reveals that these transcription factors resemble scissors in which the blades represent the leucine zipper domains and the handles represent the DNA-binding domains (see <a href="#" class="link-inline">Fig. 4-9<i style="color: rgb(0, 107, 178);">B</i></a>).</p>
