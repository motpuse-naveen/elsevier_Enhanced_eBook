When a trunk is stretched, but not ruptured, by dislocation of, say, the femoral or humeral heads, or by the nearby passage of a bullet, the axons within that nerve may respond in different ways. The degree of injury may vary along the length of a particular nerve or transversely across its cross-section: some axons will remain intact, some will sustain conduction block but recover rapidly, and yet others will degenerate throughout their entire extent distal to the injury because they have been ruptured. A proportion recover spontaneously whilst the remainder never recover.</div><div class="text" id="p0015"><a href="#bib33" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_33">Seddon (1943)</a> introduced the terms neurapraxia for conduction block, axonotmesis for a degenerative lesion of favourable prognosis, and neurotmesis for a degenerative lesion of unfavourable prognosis. <a href="#bib35" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_35">Sunderland (1951)</a> expanded this classification to five degrees of peripheral nerve injury by subdividing neurapraxia according to the degree of connective tissue disruption, and <a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_26">Mackinnon and Dellon (1988)</a> subsequently added a sixth category. However, the fundamental distinction between neurapraxia and either axonotmesis or neurotmesis remains the persistence of conduction in the distal segment of the nerve in neurapraxia, and the absence of conduction in axonotmesis or neurotmesis. In clinical practice, neurotmesis usually signifies transection of an entire nerve trunk, its constituent fascicles and their surrounding investments of perineurium and epineurium; the proximal and distal nerve stumps are frequently separated by an inter-stump gap of varying length (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 1.5.1</span></a>).

There are distinct patterns of conduction block. Anoxia is important in all of them and there are often elements of mechanical deformation, inducing alterations of the nodal and paranodal apparatus in myelinated axons, and subsequent demyelination of whole internodes or of paranodes.</div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><section><a id="s0025"/><section><a id="s0030"/><h3 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0015">Transient ischaemia</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0025">Lying in one position without moving for a long time (e.g. during coma, inebriation or anaesthesia), prolonged sitting with the legs crossed or prolonged leaning on the elbows are all situations in which a limb nerve may be transiently compressed against a bone or a hard surface. The ischaemia thus induced in the compressed nerves causes an anoxic, physiological, block of both axoplasmic transport and ion channel functions along affected axons. This is seen during operation for the exposure of limb nerves with an inflated cuff in position: stimulation of a nerve evokes a brisk muscular response by transmission through the neuromuscular junction, which then diminishes before disappearing after about 30 minutes, whereas conduction within the nerve itself can be detected for about another 30 minutes. On the other hand, direct stimulation of the muscle provokes a twitch that can be elicited for about another 2 hours; loss of this direct response signals impending muscle death. The selective vulnerability of different populations of nerve fibres is demonstrated by the classical experiment of applying an inflated cuff about the arm (<a href="#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_21">Lewis et al 1931</a>). The observer experiences first a loss of superficial sensibility, then a graduated loss of muscle power. The first pain response is lost soon after superficial sensibility fails; the delayed pain response is still detectable after 40 minutes of ischaemia. Large myelinated axons are first affected; unmyelinated axons and autonomic fibres escape, and pilomotor and vasomotor functions are scarcely affected. All modalities recover within a few minutes of release of the cuff; the unpleasant quality of the residual delayed pain sensation, and the burst of painful ‘pins and needles’ after release of the cuff, give an insight into the feelings of patients affected by dysaesthesiae.</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h4 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0020">Slowly progressing ischaemia</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0030">Conduction block caused by a haematoma or aneurysm, or by bleeding into compartments, produces early and deep autonomic paralysis and loss of power that extends over hours or days, whilst deep pressure sense and some joint position sense persist.

In the second, which approximates to neurotmesis, not only the Schwann cell basal lamina tubes, but also the connective tissue sheaths around the fascicle are interrupted; spontaneous axonal regeneration following this type of injury will be imperfect and disorderly, and may not occur at all.</div><section><a id="s0060"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0045">Deepening of a lesion in a nerve that has not been divided</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0055">Unrelieved activity of a noxious agent on an intact nerve is signified by pain and increasing neurological deficit, indicating that the lesion is deepening. Nerves within a swollen ischaemic limb or tense compartment become compressed and anoxic. Nerves displaced by an expanding haematoma become stretched and anoxic. Nerves that have become displaced into a fracture or joint are tethered and become subjected to compression, stretching and anoxia. These nerves are not severed by the initial injury; the first lesion is axonotmesis and spontaneous recovery is probable if the cause is removed. However, if this does not happen, the lesion continues to deepen into that of neurotmesis and spontaneous recovery will not occur. The speed of deepening of a lesion is related to the cause: (i) a nerve crushed by a plate or strangled by an encircling suture may recover if the cause is removed within a few minutes (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 1.5.4</span></a>); (ii) a nerve that has become compressed and anoxic within a swollen ischaemic limb will recover if perfusion of the tissues is restored within 3 hours; the likelihood of full spontaneous recovery diminishes with the passage of every hour after that time (<a href="#f0030"><span class="bold">Fig. 1.5.5</span></a>); (iii) a nerve displaced into a fracture or joint will usually recover if it is extricated within a few days, but will be destroyed if a compression device has been used to stabilize the skeleton without retrieving the nerve (<a href="#f0035"><span class="bold">Fig. 1.5.6</span></a>); (iv) function may be retained for a long time in a nerve exposed to continuing traction from a malunited fracture; (v) nerves may continue to work for months or years before failing when they are exposed to the progressing fibrosis caused by radiotherapy, by overlying split-skin graft or by other examples of deep scar; (vi) pain is the cardinal symptom of the unrelieved action of a noxious agent.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0025"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000860/main.assets/on86-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0025"/><a id="fspara0025"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 1.5.4</span> The appearance of a radial nerve after extrication from beneath a compression plate 48 hours after the first operation.

All affected axons in the extreme tip of the proximal stump and throughout the distal stump degenerate, irrespective of their calibre or functional modality; recovery is often slow and incomplete, and there may be considerable residual loss of function. Moreover, although research has tended to address issues associated with the molecular and cellular events that occur at the lesion site and target tissues, it is important to remember that injury to a peripheral nerve that induces WD also initiates significant and often long-lasting central changes in sensory ganglia and ascending and descending pathways within the spinal cord and brain; these changes also have a significant impact on the likelihood of recovery. Studies of cell bodies of human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) have revealed changes in the expression of a wide range of receptors and a remarkable alteration in the expression of genes regulating neuronal activity (<a href="#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">Rabert et al 2004</a>, <a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Lawson 2005</a>, <a href="#bib2" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_2">Anand et al 2008</a>). There is an extensive literature on WD in both central and peripheral nervous systems, and only a brief summary of the response in the peripheral nervous system is presented here (see <a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Gordon 2015</a>).</div><section><a id="s0070"/><section><a id="s0075"/><h5 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0055">Neuronal cell body and proximal stump</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0065">The central and the peripheral effects of WD are profound and, in neurotmesis, ultimately irreversible. Not only is the neuronal cell body separated from its continual supply of retrogradely transported neurotrophins, but also its central connections rapidly alter; many neurones thus isolated will die. Amputation provides a model of the effect of permanent division of axons on the spinal cord: there is extensive loss of neurones in the dorsal root ganglia and in the ventral horn, and a diminution of the large myelinated axons in the ventral and dorsal roots (<a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_13">Dyck et al 1984</a>, <a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">Suzuki et al 1993</a>).

Neurotmesis in the neonate produces a more rapid and much greater incidence of sensory and motor neurone death than in the adult. Surviving neurones rapidly upregulate a series of genes involved in repair and neuroprotection mechanisms following injury (repair-associated genes, RAGs), which direct many of the changes seen during WD and subsequent recovery (e.g. <a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Calenda et al 2012</a>).

Changes in the expression of ion channels and receptors in the neuronal cell bodies in human DRGs can be detected within a few minutes of an injury to the nerve (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Lawson 2005</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0080"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0060">Tip of proximal stump</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0070">Within a few hours of injury, the cut ends of a transected axon seal off, forming end bulbs. The end bulb that forms at the proximal tip of an axon in the proximal stump is transformed into a growth cone from which multiple needle-like filopodia and broader sheet-like lamellipodia grow out. The filopodia are rich in actin, and may extend or retract within a matter of minutes. Each axon forms new branches or sprouts: collateral sprouts arise from nodes of Ranvier at levels where the axons are still intact, and terminal sprouts arise from the tips of the surviving axons. The axon sprouts and fine cytoplasmic processes derived from their associated Schwann cells form clusters, regenerating units, surrounded by Schwann cell basal laminae. Sprouts within one regenerating unit represent the regenerative effort of one neurone and its axon. Within a few days of injury, the calibre of axons in the proximal stumps is reduced and nerve conduction velocity in the proximal segment falls.</div></section><section><a id="s0085"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0065">Distal stump</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0075">During the first 2 or 3 weeks after injury, the constitutive tissue response within a denervated distal stump involves numerous events: some sequential, others consecutive. These include the production of debris, as axons and their myelin sheaths are degraded; an increase in local blood flow; activation of resident macrophages, and recruitment and influx of exogenous macrophages; and proliferation of fibroblasts and Schwann cells. The gliotic response produces a population of dedifferentiated daughter Schwann cells that remain within the basal lamina tubes secreted by their parent cells, forming what are now called Schwann tubes but which were previously known as bands of Büngner. They behave acutely as the ‘presumed targets’ of the regrowing axons until the actual targets (muscle or sensory end organ) have been reinnervated: they secrete proteins that collectively facilitate axonal regrowth, whether by providing trophic support or by establishing a supportive growth matrix (for further reading on these interactions, see <a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Hall (2005)</a>, <a href="#bib39" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_39">Webber et al (2011)</a>, <a href="#bib5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_5">Arthur-Farraj et al (2012)</a>, <a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Gordon (2015)</a>). There is a growing consensus that Schwann cells express distinct motor and sensory phenotypes, and that this fundamental difference affects the ability of Schwann cell tubes to selectively support regenerating neurones. For example, expression of osteopontin and clusterin is upregulated in Schwann cells in transected peripheral nerves: the two secreted factors appear to facilitate regeneration of motor or sensory neurones, respectively (<a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">Wright et al 2014</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0080">While the microenvironment of an acutely denervated distal stump facilitates axonal regrowth because it provides a vascularized segment of longitudinally orientated, laminin-rich basal lamina tubes filled with axon-responsive Schwann cells, a chronically denervated distal stump is associated with poor axonal regeneration and poor functional recovery (<a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Sulaiman and Gordon 2009</a>).

A muscle spindle may become reinnervated by afferents normally destined for the Golgi tendon organ; many tendon organs remain denervated and the regenerated endings are frequently abnormal in appearance.

There may be selective failure of regeneration of the largest-diameter fibres and of co-activation of the α and γ efferents. The normal movement of joints is brought about by smoothly coordinated and controlled activity in muscles that is precisely and delicately regulated by inhibition and facilitation of the motor neurones. The conversion of an antagonist to an agonist is the basis of musculotendinous transfer; it is common to see patients actively extending the knee or the ankle and toes as soon as the postoperative splint is removed after hamstring to quadriceps transfer or anterior transfer of tibialis posterior. Reinnervated muscles usually fail to convert after muscle transfer, irrespective of their power.

That said, the fundamental cellular processes that underlie subsequent regeneration are similar in the laboratory, in the injuries of civilian practice and in the wounds of war, although in clinical practice they are <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1.66E19" id="pagebreak_1.66E19"/><a id="pg166.e18"/>modified by the violence of the injury, by the effects of injury on associated tissues and, in particular, by ischaemia and by delay before repair. Some general conclusions may be drawn from extensive clinical and laboratory studies.</div><div class="text" id="p0135">The concept of retrograde degeneration of the axon extending to the first internode applies only to the most benign lesion: that of experimentally crushing the nerve between the tips of a jeweller’s forceps. The extent of longitudinal damage to a nerve is greater in a rupture caused by traction than it is in ‘tidy’ transections caused by knife or glass; this effect worsens with increasing delay before repair, is worse still when healing has been complicated by sepsis, and worst of all in neglected ischaemia.</div><div class="text" id="p0140">Failure to repair main vessels and to ensure perfusion of tissues is profoundly deleterious to regeneration and rules out worthwhile recovery of function. As time goes by, the cellular response in both stumps changes from one that facilitates regeneration to one that is less favourable. Dense collagenization, a profusion of fibroblasts and a loss of Schwann cells are characteristics of the chronically denervated distal stump and are typical of late cases. The normal architecture of a nerve is most closely restored to normal in a well-executed, tension-free primary suture. Regeneration through a graft falls away along its length and not solely at the suture lines. Delay before repair leads to increasing fibrosis and to shrinking of the distal segment so that it becomes impossible to ensure an accurate topographical match. Destruction of the target tissues, of muscle and skin, limits function even when there is strong regeneration. Chronological age plays an important role: for example, signalling mechanisms involved in the reinnervation of skeletal muscle may become impaired with age (<a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Kawabuchi et al 2011</a>).</div></section></section></section></section><footer><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebib0010"/><h2 class="reftitle" id="s0120">References</h2><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebibsec0010"/><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib1"><!--<a hreef="#bib_1">1</a>. --><a id="ref0010"/><a href="#bib_1">Anand</a> P, Birch R. <cite>Restoration of sensory function and lack of long-term chronic pain syndromes after brachial plexus injury in human neonates</cite>. <cite><i>Brain</i></cite>. 2002;125:113–122.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib2"><!--<a hreef="#bib_2">2</a>. --><a id="ref0015"/><a href="#bib_2">Anand</a> U, Otto W.R, Facer P, et al. <cite>TRPA1 receptor localisation in the human peripheral nervous system and functional studies in cultured human and rat sensory neurons</cite>. <cite><i>Neurosci Lett</i></cite>. 2008;438:221–227.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib3"><!--<a hreef="#bib_3">3</a>. --><a id="ref0020"/><a href="#bib_3">Anand</a> P, Privitera R, Yiangou Y, et al. <cite>Trench foot or non-freezing cold injury as a painful vaso-neuropathy: clinical and skin biopsy assessments</cite>. <cite><i>Front Neurol</i></cite>. 2017;8:514.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib4"><!--<a hreef="#bib_4">4</a>. --><a id="ref0025"/><a href="#bib_4">Anand</a> P, Terenghi G, Birch R, et al. <cite>Endogenous NGF and CNTF levels in human peripheral nerve injury</cite>. <cite><i>Neuroreport</i></cite>. 1997;8(8):1935–1938.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib5"><!--<a hreef="#bib_5">5</a>. --><a id="ref0030"/><a href="#bib_5">Arthur-Farraj</a> P.J, Latouche M, Wilton D.K, et al. <cite>c-Jun reprograms Schwann cells of injured nerves to generate a repair cell essential for regeneration</cite>. <cite><i>Neuron</i></cite>. 2012;75:633–647.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib6"><!--<a hreef="#bib_6">6</a>. --><a id="ref0035"/><a href="#bib_6">Birch</a> R, Misra P, Stewart M.P, et al. <cite>Nerve injuries sustained during warfare: part II: Outcomes</cite>. <cite><i>J Bone Joint Surg Br</i></cite>. 2012;94:529–535.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib7"><!--<a hreef="#bib_7">7</a>. --><a id="ref0040"/><a href="#bib_7">Birch</a> R, Clair Strange St. F.G. <cite>A new type of peripheral nerve lesion</cite>. <cite><i>J Bone Joint Surg Br</i></cite>. 1990;72:312–313.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib8"><!--<a hreef="#bib_8">8</a>. --><a id="ref0045"/><a href="#bib_8">Björkman</a> A, Weibull A, Rosén B, et al. <cite>Rapid cortical reorganisation and improved sensitivity of the hand following cutaneous anaesthesia of the forearm</cite>. <cite><i>Eur J Neurosci</i></cite>. 2009;29:837–844.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib9"><!--<a hreef="#bib_9">9</a>. --><a id="ref0050"/><a href="#bib_9">Calenda</a> G, Strong T.D, Pavlovich C.P, et al. <cite>Whole genome microarray of the major pelvic ganglion after cavernous nerve injury: new insights into molecular profile changes after nerve injury</cite>. <cite><i>BJU Int</i></cite>. 2012;109:1552–1564.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib10"><!--<a hreef="#bib_10">10</a>. --><a id="ref0055"/><a href="#bib_10">Carlstedt</a> T. <cite><i>Central Nerve Plexus Injury</i></cite>. London: Imperial College Press; 2007.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib11"><!--<a hreef="#bib_11">11</a>. --><a id="ref0060"/><a href="#bib_11">Christie</a> K.J, Zochodne D. <cite>Neuroscience Forefront Review.
