It describes epithelia and general connective tissues in detail. Epithelia are classified and their specialized functions outlined, including protective and selective barrier functions and glandular secretion. The molecular structure of basal lamina is included here. General connective tissues consist of cellular components (resident cells and migratory cells of haemopoietic origin) and an extracellular matrix (ECM).The molecular components of the ECM (fibrous and non-fibrous elements) are described and their functions detailed. General connective tissues are classified and their functions described. Assemblies of tissues called mucosae and their supporting layers are components of many organ systems and are described. A number of pathologies involving cellular and molecular structures covered in the chapter are outlined.</p></div></div></section>-->

            <div class="textfl" id="p0010">Cells evolved as single, free-living organisms, but natural selection
                favoured more complex communities of cells, multicellular organisms, where groups of cells specialize
                during development to carry out specific functions for the body as a whole. This allowed the emergence
                of larger organisms with greater control over their internal environment and the evolution of highly
                specialized organic structures such as the brain. The human body contains more than 200 different cell
                types, sharing the same genome but with different patterns of gene expression.</div>
            <div class="text" id="p0015">Some cells in the body are essentially migratory, but most exist as cellular
                aggregates in which individual cells carry out similar or closely related functions in a coordinated
                manner. These aggregates are termed tissues, and can be classified into a fairly small number of broad
                categories on the basis of their structure, function and molecular properties. On the basis of their
                structure, most tissues are divided into four major types: epithelia, connective or supporting tissue,
                muscle and nervous tissue. Epithelia are continuous layers of cells with little intercellular space,
                which cover or line surfaces, or have been so derived. In connective tissues, the cells are embedded in
                an extracellular matrix, which, typically, forms a substantial and important component of the tissue.
                Muscle consists largely of specialized contractile cells. Nervous tissue consists of cells specialized
                for conducting and transmitting electrical and chemical signals and the cells that support this
                activity.</div>
            <div class="text" id="p0020">There is molecular evidence that this structure-based scheme of classification
                has validity. Thus the intermediate filament proteins characteristic of all epithelia are keratins (<a
                    href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Pan et al 2012</a>); those of
                connective tissue are vimentins; those of muscle are desmins; and those of nervous tissue are
                neurofilament and glial fibrillary acidic proteins. However, cells such as myofibroblasts,
                neuroepithelial sensory receptors and ependymal cells of the central nervous system have features of
                more than one tissue type. Despite its anomalies, the scheme is useful for descriptive purposes; it is
                widely used and will be adopted here.</div>
            <div class="text" id="p0025">In this chapter, two of the major tissue categories, epithelia and general
                connective and supporting tissues, will be described. Specialized skeletal connective tissues, i.e.
                cartilage and bone, together with skeletal muscle, are described in detail in <a

                <h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Epithelia</h2>
                <div class="textfl" id="p0030">The term epithelium is applied to the layer or layers of cells that cover
                    the body surfaces or line the body cavities that open on to it. The fate of embryonic epithelial
                    populations is illustrated in <a href="#f0020">Fig. 2.3</a>. Epithelia function generally as
                    selective barriers that facilitate, or inhibit, the passage of substances across the surfaces they
                    cover. In addition, they may: protect underlying tissues against dehydration, chemical or mechanical
                    damage; synthesize and secrete products into the spaces that they line; and function as sensory
                    surfaces. In this respect, many features of nervous tissue can be regarded as those of a modified
                    epithelium and the two tissue types share an origin in embryonic ectoderm.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0035">Epithelia (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 2.1</span></a>) are
                    predominantly cellular and the little extracellular material they possess is limited to the basal
                    lamina. Intercellular junctions, which are usually numerous, maintain the mechanical cohesiveness of
                    the epithelial sheet and contribute to its barrier functions. A series of three intercellular
                    junctions forms a typical epithelial junctional complex: in sequence from the apical surface, this
                    consists of a tight junctional zone, an adherent (intermediate) junctional zone and a region of
                    discrete desmosome junctions. Epithelial cell shape is most usually polygonal and partly determined
                    by cytoplasmic features such as secretory granules. The basal surface of an epithelium lies in
                    contact with a thin layer of filamentous protein and proteoglycan termed the basal lamina, which is
                    synthesized predominantly by the epithelial cells. The basal lamina is described on <a
                        href="#pg35">p. 35</a>.</div>

                <div class="text" id="p0040">Epithelia can usually regenerate when injured. Indeed, many epithelia
                    continuously replace their cells to offset cell loss caused by mechanical abrasion (reviewed in <a
                        href="#bib6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_6">Blanpain et al 2007</a>). Blood
                    vessels do not penetrate typical epithelia and so cells receive their nutrition by diffusion from
                    capillaries of neighbouring connective tissues. This arrangement limits the maximum thickness of
                    living epithelial cell layers. Epithelia, together with their supporting connective tissue, can
                    often be removed surgically as one layer, which is collectively known as a membrane. Where the
                    surface of a membrane is moistened by mucous glands it is called a mucous membrane or mucosa (see <a
                        href="#pg41">p. 41</a>), whereas a similar layer of connective tissue covered by mesothelium is
                    called a serous membrane or serosa.</div>

                    <h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0025">Classification</h3>
                    <div class="textfl" id="p0045">Epithelia can be classified as unilaminar (single-layered, simple),
                        in which a single layer of cells rests on a basal lamina; or multilaminar, in which the layer is
                        more than one cell thick. The latter includes: stratified squamous epithelia, in which flattened
                        superficial cells are constantly replaced from the basal layers; urothelium (transitional
                        epithelium), which serves special functions in the urinary tract; and other multilaminar
                        epithelia such as those lining the largest ducts of some exocrine glands, which, like
                        urothelium, are replaced only very slowly under normal conditions. Seminiferous epithelium is a
                        specialized multilaminar tissue found only in the testis.</div>

                        <h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0030">Unilaminar (simple) epithelia</h4>
                        <div class="textfl" id="p0050">Unilaminar epithelia are further classified according to the
                            shape of their cells, into squamous, cuboidal, columnar and pseudostratified types. Cell
                            shape may, in some cases, be related to cell volume. Where little cytoplasm is present,
                            there are generally few organelles and therefore there is low metabolic activity and cells
                            are squamous or low cuboidal. Highly active cells, e.g. secretory epithelia, contain
                            abundant mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, and are typically tall cuboidal or
                            columnar. Unilaminar epithelia can also be subdivided into those that have special
                            functions, such as those with cilia, numerous microvilli, secretory vacuoles (in mucous and
                            serous glandular cells) or sensory features. Myoepithelial cells, which are contractile, are
                            found as isolated cells associated with glandular structures, e.g. salivary and mammary
                            glands.</div>

                            <div class="textfl" id="p0055">Simple squamous epithelium is composed of flattened, tightly
                                apposed, polygonal cells (squames). This type of epithelium is described as tessellated
                                when the cells have complex, interlocking borders rather than straight boundaries. The

                                where their surface area is huge and cytoplasmic volume correspondingly large, and they
                                also form the outer capsular wall of renal corpuscles, the thin segments of the renal
                                tubules and various parts of the inner ear. Because it is so thin, simple squamous
                                epithelium allows rapid diffusion of gases and water across its surface; it may also
                                engage in active transport, as indicated by the presence of numerous endocytic vesicles
                                in these cells. Tight junctions (occluding junctions, zonulae occludentes) between
                                adjacent cells ensure that materials pass primarily through cells, rather than between
                                them.</div>

                                epithelium. Some constitute an immature basal cell layer of smaller cells, which are

                                that undergo considerable distension and contraction. It can therefore stretch greatly
                                without losing its integrity. In stretching, the cells become flattened without altering
                                their positions relative to each other, because they are firmly connected by numerous
                                desmosomes. However, the urothelium appears to be reduced to only 2–3 cells thick. The
                                epithelium is called transitional because of the apparent transition from a stratified
                                cuboidal epithelium to a stratified squamous epithelium, which occurs as it is stretched
                                to accommodate urine, particularly in the bladder. The basal cells are basophilic and
                                contain many ribosomes; they are uninucleate (diploid), and cuboidal when relaxed. More
                                apically, they form large binucleate or, more often, polyploid uninucleate cells. The
                                surface cells are the largest and may even be octoploid; in the relaxed state they

                                membrane in which plaques of intramembranous glycoprotein particles are embedded to
                                stiffen the membrane. When the epithelium is relaxed, the surface area of the cells is
                                reduced and the plaques are partially internalized by the hinge-like action of the more
                                flexible interplaque membrane regions. The plaques re-emerge on to the surface when it

                    environment facing their free surfaces by the directed transport of ions, water or macromolecules.
                    This is particularly well demonstrated in glandular tissue, in which the metabolism and structural
                    organization of the cells are specialized for the synthesis and secretion of macromolecules, usually
                    from the apical surface. Such cells may exist in isolation amongst other non-secretory cells of an
                    epithelium, e.g. goblet cells in the absorptive lining of the small intestine, or may form highly
                    coherent sheets of epithelium with a common secretory function, e.g. the mucous lining of the
                    stomach and, in a highly invaginated structure, the complex salivary glands.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0140">Glands are conventionally subdivided into exocrine glands and endocrine
                    glands. Exocrine glands secrete, usually via a duct, onto surfaces that are continuous with the
                    exterior of the body, including the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, urinary and genital
                    ducts and their derivatives, and the skin. Endocrine glands are ductless and secrete hormones
                    directly into interstitial fluid and thence the circulatory system, to be conveyed throughout the
                    body to affect the activities of other cells. The suprarenal (adrenal) medulla and the
                    neurohypophysis are neurosecretory.</div>

                    secretions diffuse locally to cellular targets in the immediate vicinity: many are classed as
                    neuroendocrine cells because they secrete molecules active elsewhere in the nervous system as
                    neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. Modes of signalling by secretory cells are illustrated in <a

                        <div class="textfl" id="p0150">Secretory mechanisms vary. Secretions that are initially packaged
                            into membrane-bound vesicles are conveyed to the cell surface, where they are discharged by
                            exocytosis. This is merocrine secretion, which is by far the most common secretory
                            mechanism, where vesicle membranes fuse with the plasma membrane to release their contents
                            to the exterior (<a href="#f0035"><span class="bold">Fig. 2.6</span></a>). Specialized
                            transmembrane molecules in the secretory vesicle wall recognize marker proteins on the
                            cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane and bind to them. This initiates interactions with
                            other proteins that cause the fusion of the two membranes and the consequent release of the
                            vesicle contents. The stimulus for secretion varies with the type of cell but often appears
                            to involve a rise in intracellular calcium. Glands such as the simple sweat glands of the
                            skin, where ions and water are actively transported from plasma as an exudate, were once
                            classified as eccrine glands. They are now known to synthesize and secrete small amounts of
                            protein by a merocrine mechanism, and have been reclassified as merocrine glands.</div>

                        <div class="textfl" id="p0165">Exocrine glands may be unicellular or multicellular. The latter
                            may be in the form of simple sheets of secretory cells, e.g. the lining of the stomach, or
                            may be structurally more complex and invaginated to a variable degree. Such glands may be
                            simple units or their connection to the surface may be branched (see <a href="#f0035">Fig.
                                2.6</a>). Simple unbranched tubular glands exist in the walls of many of the hollow
                            viscera, e.g. the small intestine and uterus, whereas some simple glands have expanded,
                            flask-like ends (acini or alveoli). Such glands may consist entirely of secretory cells, or
                            may have a blind-ending secretory portion that leads through a non-secretory duct to the
                            surface, in which case the ducts may modify the secretions as they pass along them.</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p0170">Glands with ducts may be branched (compound) and sometimes form
                            elaborate ductal trees. Such glands generally have acinar or alveolar secretory lobules, as
                            in the exocrine pancreas, but the secretory units may alternatively be tubular or mixed
                            tubulo-acinar. More than one type of secretory cell may occur within a particular secretory
                            unit, or individual units may be specialized to just one type of secretion (e.g. serous
                            acini of salivary glands).</div>
                        <div class="text" id="p0175">Exocrine glands are also classified by their secretory products.
                            Secretory cells in mucus-secreting or mucous glands have frothy cytoplasm and basal,

                            methods that detect carbohydrate residues. However, in general (i.e. non-specific)
                            histological preparations, they are weakly stained because much of their content of
                            water-rich mucin has been extracted by the processing procedures. Secretory cells in serous
                            glands have centrally placed nuclei and eosinophilic secretory storage granules in their
                            cytoplasm. They secrete mainly glycoproteins (including lysozyme) and digestive enzymes.

                        <div class="text" id="p0180">Some glands are almost entirely mucous (e.g. the sublingual

                            submandibular gland is mixed, in that some lobules are predominantly mucous and others
                            serous. Mucous acini may share a lumen with clusters of serous cells (seen in routine
                            preparations as serous demilunes). Although this simple approach to classification is useful
                            for general descriptive purposes, the diversity of molecules synthesized and secreted by
                            glands is such that complex mixtures often exist within the same cell.</div>

                        the dispersed neuroendocrine system, e.g. throughout the alimentary and respiratory tracts. They
                        produce peptide hormones, many of which may function as neurotransmitters: they can express
                        neurone-specific enolase, synaptophysin, secretogranins and chromogranins as well as enzymes
                        involved in peptide hormone synthesis and processing (<a href="#bib2" role="doc-noteref"

                        situated within a mucosal epithelium and their bases often rest on the basal lamina. In response
                        to an external stimulus, they secrete their product basally into interstitial fluid. They
                        typically have a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum for peptide synthesis, large Golgi
                        complexes for packaging their hormones, and numerous secretory granules that store and also

                    <div class="textfl" id="p0195">The activities of cells in the various tissue and organ systems of
                        the body are tightly regulated by the coordinated activity of the endocrine and autonomic
                        nervous systems. Endocrine (and paracrine) signals reach target cells in interstitial fluid,
                        often via blood plasma, and together with autonomic nervous signals they ensure that the body
                        responds to normal physiological stimuli and adjusts to changes in the external environment.
                        Hormone secretion is itself controlled in a number of ways, e.g. by neural control, regulatory
                        feedback loops or according to various cyclical, rhythmical or pulsatile patterns of release.
                        Endocrine glands have a rich vascular supply and their blood flow is controlled by autonomic
                        vasomotor nerves, which can thus modify glandular activity.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0200">Glandular activity may also be controlled directly by autonomic
                        secretomotor fibres, which may either form synapses on the bases of gland cells (e.g. in the
                        suprarenal medulla) or release neuromediators in the vicinity of the glands and reach them by
                        diffusion. Alternatively, the autonomic nervous system may act indirectly on gland cells, e.g.
                        on neuroendocrine G cells via histamine, released neurogenically from another neuroendocrine
                        cell in the gastric lining. Such paracrine activities of neuroendocrine cells are also important
                        in the respiratory system.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0205">Circulating hormones from the adenohypophysis stimulate synthesis and
                        secretion by target cells in many endocrine glands. Such signals, mostly detected by receptors
                        at the cell surface and mediated by second messenger systems, may increase the synthetic
                        activity of gland cells, and may cause them to discharge their secretions by exocytosis.
                        Secretions from certain exocrine glandular cells are expressed rapidly from those glands by the
                        contraction of associated myoepithelial cells (see <a href="#f0020">Figs 2.3</a>–<a

                        cells may be under direct neural control, as in the salivary glands, or they may respond to
                        circulating hormones, as in the mammary gland, where they respond to the concentration of
                        circulating oxytocin.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="35"

                            termed the master gland because of its central role in endocrine physiological processes (<a

                            means by which the central nervous system regulates and integrates, by non-neural
                            mechanisms, the widespread functions of the body, including the activities of other
                            endocrine glands and, often indirectly, exocrine glands such as the breast. Regulatory
                            hormones from the adenohypophysis stimulate synthesis and secretion in target cells of many
                            endocrine glands; these glands therefore respond to, as well as generate, hormonal signals.

                            to most regulatory feedback loops within the endocrine system. Loops can be either positive
                            or negative, e.g. the hypothalamus stimulates release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
                            by the adenohypophysis, which in turn stimulates ovarian follicular maturation and secretion
                            of oestradiol, which acts on breast and endometrial target tissues. Oestradiol, in this
                            case, also acts back on the adenohypophysis and hypothalamus to reinforce their function
                            positively in a feedback loop. In contrast, hypothalamic and adenohypophysial stimulation of
                            testicular production of testosterone, which acts on targets such as skeletal muscle, is
                            negatively regulated in a feedback loop generated by circulating testosterone. Such negative

                    endothelia. In other tissues, the basal lamina separates two layers of cells and there are no
                    intervening typical connective tissue elements, e.g. in the thick basal lamina of the renal

                    the plasma membrane of the cell it supports by a narrow electron-lucent zone, the lamina lucida. The
                    lamina lucida is absent from tissues prepared by rapid freezing and so may be an artefact. In many
                    tissues this zone is crossed by integral plasma membrane proteins, e.g. keratinocyte hemidesmosomes
                    are anchored into the lamina densa in the basal lamina of the epidermis. The basal lamina is a
                    delicate felt-like network composed largely of two glycoprotein polymers, laminin and type IV
                    collagen. The adhesive glycoprotein laminin is essential for the initial self-assembly of basal
                    laminae into two-dimensional sheets interwoven with each other. Early embryonic basal lamina is
                    formed only of the laminin polymer. Two other molecules cross-link and stabilize the network:
                    nidogen (entactin), which crosslinks laminin to collagen IV and perlecan (a large heparan sulphate
                    proteoglycan).</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0235">Although all basal laminae have a similar form, their thickness and precise
                    molecular composition vary between tissues and even within a tissue, e.g. between the crypts and
                    villi of the small intestine. The isoforms of laminin and collagen type IV differ in various
                    tissues; thus Schwann cells and muscle cells express laminin-2 (merosin) rather than the
                    prototypical laminin-1. Laminin-5, although not itself a basal lamina component, is found in the
                    hemidesmosomes of the basal epidermis and links the basal lamina with epidermal transmembrane

                    collagen type IV in the basal lamina of different tissues is reflected in tissue-specific disease
                    patterns. Mutations in certain collagen genes expressed in kidney glomeruli (and a few other

                        selectively permeable barriers (anionic filters) between adjacent tissues, e.g. in the
                        glomerular filter of the kidney; anchor epithelial and connective tissues, and so stabilize and
                        orientate the tissue layers; may exert instructive effects on adjacent tissues, and so determine
                        their polarity, rate of cell division, cell survival, etc.; and regulate angiogenesis. In
                        addition, they may act as pathways for the migration and pathfinding activities of growing cell

                                the control of energy balance and lipid homeostasis. There is a growing view that it may
                                play a similarly important role as an endocrine organ, secreting a class of peptides,
                                including leptin, called adipokines which may enter the blood via capillaries or lymph.
                                Different types of adipose tissue display functional and regional heterogeneity and
                                differ in their involvement with disease processes (reviewed in <a href="#bib10"

                                The mobilization of fat is under nervous or hormonal control; noradrenaline
                                (norepinephrine) released at sympathetic nerve endings in adipose tissue is particularly
                                important in this respect. No new adipose tissue is thought to form after the immediate
                                postnatal period, and accumulation of body fat, as in obesity, is due to excessive
                                accumulation of lipid in existing adipocytes, which become very large. Conversely,
                                weight loss results from the mobilization and metabolism of lipid from adipocyte stores,
                                with the consequent shrinkage of the cells.</div>

                    <div class="textfl" id="p0365">Skeletal tissues, cartilage and bone are generally classified with
                        the connective tissues, but their structure and functions are highly specialized and they are
                        described in <a href="../B9780702077050000057/B9780702077050000057.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>. As with
                        the general connective tissues, these specialized types are characterized by their extracellular
                        matrix, which forms the major component of the tissues and is responsible for their properties.
                        The resident cells are different from those in general connective tissues. Cartilage is
                        populated by chondroblasts, which synthesize the matrix, and by mature chondrocytes. Bone matrix
                        is elaborated by osteoblasts. Their mature progeny, osteocytes, are embedded within the matrix,
                        which they help to mineralize, turn over and maintain. A third cell type, the osteoclast, has a
                        different lineage origin and is derived from haemopoietic tissue; osteoclasts are responsible
                        for bone degradation and remodelling in collaboration with osteoblasts.</div>

                    <div class="textfl" id="p0370">The term extracellular matrix is applied collectively to the
                        extracellular components of connective and supporting tissues. Essentially, it consists of a
                        system of insoluble protein fibres, adhesive glycoproteins and soluble complexes composed of
                        carbohydrate polymers linked to protein molecules (proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans) that
                        bind water. The extracellular matrix distributes the mechanical stresses on tissues and also
                        provides the structural environment of the cells embedded in it, forming a framework to which
                        they adhere and on which they can move (reviewed in <a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref"

                        With the exception of bone matrix, it provides a highly hydrated medium, through which
                        metabolites, gases and nutrients can diffuse freely between cells and the blood vessels
                        traversing it or, in the case of cartilage, passing nearby.</div>
                    <div class="text" id="p0375">There are many complex interactions between connective tissue cells and
                        the extracellular matrix. The cells continually synthesize, secrete, modify and degrade
                        extracellular matrix components, and respond to contact with the matrix in the regulation of
                        cell metabolism, proliferation and motility. Degradation of the matrix is an important feature
                        of embryonic development, morphogenesis, angiogenesis, tissue repair and remodelling (<a

                        Various types of proteinase are involved, principally metalloproteinases such as matrix
                        metalloproteinases (MMPs), and those with a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain (ADAMs)
                        that include ADAMs with a thrombospondin domain (ADAMTS). Tissue remodelling depends on the
                        controlled degradation of the extracellular matrix by secreted MMPs, regulated by their specific
                        inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, TIMPs), as occurs, for instance, during
                        involution of the postpartum uterus or during menstrual lysis and shedding of the endometrium

                        the vicinity. While precisely regulated under physiological conditions, pathologically
                        dysregulated extracellular matrix degradation is a cause of many diseases, such as

                        cell–matrix adhesion and matrix–cell signalling. These glycoproteins include fibronectin,

                        proteins. The glycosaminoglycans of the interfibrillar matrix are, with one notable exception,
                        post-translationally modified proteoglycan molecules in which long polysaccharide side chains
                        are added to short core proteins during transit through the secretory pathway between the rough

                        abundance of its different components. Collagen fibres resist tension, whereas elastin provides
                        a measure of resilience to deformation by stretching. The highly hydrated, soluble polymers of
                        the interfibrillar material (proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, mainly hyaluronan) generally
                        form a stiff gel resisting compressive forces. Thus tissues that are specialized to resist
                        tensile forces (e.g. tendons) are rich in collagen fibrils; tissues that accommodate changes in
                        shape and volume (e.g. mesenteries) are rich in elastic fibres; and those that absorb
                        compressive forces (e.g. cartilages) are rich in glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans. In bone,
                        mineral crystals take the place of most of the soluble polymers and endow the tissue with

                                tissues. The first collagen to be characterized was type I, the most abundant of all the

                                vessels and the sclera of the eyeball. The characteristic collagen of cartilage and the
                                vitreous body of the eye, with a slightly different chemical composition, is type II,
                                whereas type III is present in several tissues, including the dermis and blood vessels,
                                and type IV is in basal lamina. The other types are widely distributed in various
                                tissues. Five of the collagens, types I, II, III, V and XI, form fibrils; types IV, VIII
                                and X form sheets or meshworks; types VI, VII, IX, XII, XIV and XVIII have an anchoring

                                of different collagens. Typical features include hyperelasticity of skin and
                                hypermobility of joints. The loss of tensile strength imparted by collagen leads to

                                    that are joined at one end to form a structure that resembles the spokes of a wheel.
                                    There is a family of tenascin molecules, generated by alternative splicing of the
                                    tenascin gene transcript. Tenascin is abundant in embryonic tissues but its
                                    distribution is restricted in the adult. It appears to be important in guiding cell
                                    migration and axonal growth in early development: it may either promote or inhibit

                    almost all are pathological; the altered cells are termed metaplastic. A very common and
                    physiologically normal example is the squamous metaplasia of columnar secretory epithelium of the
                    distal endocervical canal, when exposed to the hormonally stimulated vaginal environment. Gastric
                    metaplasia of the lower oesophagus may occur when chronic reflux of gastric juices exposes its
                    stratified squamous epithelial lining to acid, and the original epithelium is replaced by a
                    mucus-secreting columnar epithelium typical of the stomach (Barrett’s oesophagus); this is
                    pathological and susceptible to malignant change. Similarly, the respiratory epithelium (see <a
                        href="#f0015">Fig. 2.2D</a>) of the upper airway often develops foci of stratified squamous
                    metaplasia in response to irritants in cigarette smoke. Mesenchymal (osseous) metaplasia can occur,
                    for example, in the fibrous connective tissue of muscles subjected to repeated damage, where
                    trabeculi of bone develop. It is thought that stem cells (rather than the differentiated cells) in
                    the affected tissue respond to changes in their environment by altering their differentiation
                    pathway, a process that may be reversible if the stimulus is removed. There is evidence suggesting
                    that cellular plasticity, known for many years to occur experimentally in the laboratory, may be
                    more widespread in life than has been appreciated, playing a role in normal tissue homeostasis and

                <div class="text" id="p0535">Submucosa is a layer of supporting connective tissue that usually lies
                    below the muscularis mucosae. It may contain mucous or seromucous submucosal glands. Inflammation of
                    the viscera involves, primarily, the connective tissues of the submucosa and lamina propria, and is
                    characterized by dilated vessels, oedema, and accumulations of extravasated immune defence cells.
                    Most mucosae are also supported by one or more layers of smooth muscle, the muscularis externa.
                    Contraction of this muscle may constrict the mucosal lumen (e.g. in the airway) or, where there are
                    two or more muscle layers orientated in opposing directions (e.g. in the intestines), cause
                    peristaltic movement of the viscus and the contents of its lumen. The outer surface of the muscle
                    may be covered by a serosa or, where the structure is retroperitoneal or passes through the pelvic
                    floor, by a connective tissue adventitia.</div>

                <div class="textfl" id="p0540">Mucus is a viscous suspension of complex glycoproteins (mucins) of
                    various kinds, and is secreted by scattered individual epithelial (goblet) cells, a secretory
                    surface epithelium (e.g. the stomach lining) or mucous and seromucous glands. Its elasticity and
                    viscosity play major roles in regulating the transport of food, drugs, particles (including
                    nanoparticles and larger micron-scale particles), and infectious organisms, across mucosal linings
                    (<a href="#bib5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_5">Bansil and Turner 2018</a>).
                </div>
                <div class="text" id="p0545">The precise composition of the mucus varies with the tissue and secretory
                    cells that produce it: all mucins consist of filamentous core proteins with attached carbohydrate
                    chains that are usually branched; salivary mucins contain nearly 600 chains. Carbohydrate residues
                    include glucose, fucose, galactose and <span class="italic">N</span>-acetylglucosamine (sialic
                    acid). The terminals of some carbohydrate chains are identical to the blood group antigens of the
                    ABO group in the majority of the population (secretors, bearing the secretor gene <span
                        class="italic">S</span><sup>e</sup>), and can be detected in salivary mucus by means of
                    appropriate clinical tests. The long polymeric carbohydrate chains bind water and protect surfaces
                    against drying; they also provide good lubricating properties. In concentrated form, mucins form
                    viscous layers that protect the underlying tissues against damage. Mucins may also exist as
                    transmembrane glycoproteins and bind to selectins on complementary cell surfaces.</div>
                <div class="text" id="p0550">Synthesis of mucus starts in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and
                    progresses to the Golgi complex, where it is conjugated with sulphated carbohydrates to form the
                    glycoprotein, mucinogen. This is exported in small, dense, membrane-bound vesicles that swell as
                    they approach the cell surface, with which they fuse before releasing their contents. Secreted mucus
                    is hydrated through the action of epithelial ion channels that transport chloride extracellularly
                    and take up sodium; water follows the movement of chloride by osmosis and dilutes mucus. In this
                    way, mucus gains more fluid and exhibits less viscous properties. In individuals with cystic
                    fibrosis, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<span class="italic">CFTR</span>)
                    gene is defective, impairing the transport of chloride and hydration of mucus, which therefore
                    remains thick and sticky, traps bacteria and leads to infection as well as causing obstruction of
                    passages such as airways and ducts.</div>

                    tissue that contains numerous blood and lymphatic vessels. Serosa lines the pleural, pericardial and
                    peritoneal cavities, and covers the external surfaces of organs lying within those cavities and, in
                    the abdomen, the mesenteries that envelop them. A potential space, filled with a small amount of
                    protein-containing serous fluid, largely an exudate of interstitial fluid, exists between the outer

                <div class="textfl" id="p0560">Fascia is a generic term applied to sheaths, sheets or other dissectible
                    masses of connective tissue that are large enough to be visible to the unaided eye. Deeper-lying
                    condensations of connective tissue have been defined according to their location, e.g. investing
                    muscles (fascia musculorum) or viscera (fascia visceralis). (See <a
                        href="../B9780702077050000860/B9780702077050000860.xhtml">Commentary 1.6</a><span

                    and lymph vessels as they pass between other structures, often linking them together as
                    neurovascular bundles. Some large vessels, e.g. the common carotid and femoral arteries, are
                    invested by a dense connective tissue sheath that may be functionally significant, aiding venous
                    return by approximating large veins to pulsating arteries.</div>
