It is largely, but not entirely, contained within the temporal bone. The ears not only receive, modulate, conduct, amplify and discriminately analyse the complex pressure waves that are sound, but also contain the end organs of balance.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Temporal Bone</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0015">Each temporal bone consists of four components: the squamous, petromastoid and tympanic parts and the styloid process (<a href="#f0010">Fig. 42.1</a>). The squamous part has a shallow mandibular fossa associated with the temporomandibular joint (<a href="../B9780702077050000380/B9780702077050000380.xhtml">Ch. 38</a>). The petromastoid part is relatively large; its petrous portion houses the auditory apparatus and is formed of compact bone. In contrast, the mastoid process is trabecular and variably pneumatized. The tympanic part has the form of a thin and incomplete ring whose ends are fused with the squamous part. The styloid process gives attachment to the styloid group of muscles. The temporal bone contains four canals: the external acoustic meatus (external auditory canal), visible on the lateral surface, through which sound waves travel to the tympanic membrane; the internal acoustic meatus (internal auditory canal), evident on the medial surface, through which the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves pass; the facial (Fallopian) canal, through which the facial nerve passes from the internal acoustic meatus to the stylomastoid foramen and neck; and the carotid canal, through which the internal carotid artery passes from the neck to the foramen lacerum and cavernous sinus.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000422/main.assets/f42-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 42.1</span> The left temporal bone. <span class="bold">A</span>, Lateral aspect. <span class="bold">B</span>, Medial aspect. <span class="bold">C</span>, Inferior aspect. <br/><span class="figcredit">Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy © Elsevier GmbH, Urban &amp; Fischer, Munich.</span><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="737" id="pagebreak_737"/></figcaption></figure></div><section><a id="s0020"/><section><a id="s9020"/><h3 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0025">Squamous part</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0020">The squamous part lies anterosuperiorly and is thin and partly translucent. Its external temporal surface is smooth, slightly convex, and forms part of the temporal fossa, to which temporalis muscle is attached. Above the external acoustic meatus, it is grooved vertically by the middle temporal artery, a branch of the superficial temporal artery (<a href="#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_8">Daraei and Mattox 2018</a>). The supramastoid crest curves backwards and upwards across its posterior part and gives attachment to the temporal fascia. The junction between the squamous and mastoid parts is approximately 1.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm below this crest, and traces of the squamomastoid suture may persist.

The triangle usually contains a small suprameatal spine anteriorly.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">The internal cerebral surface of the squamous part is concave and contains depressions that correspond to convolutions of the temporal lobe of the cerebral hemisphere. This surface is grooved by the middle meningeal vessels. Its lower border is fused to the anterior region of the petrous part but traces of a petrosquamosal suture often appear in adult bones. The superior border is thin and bevelled internally; it overlaps the inferior border of the parietal bone at the squamosal suture. Posteriorly, it forms an angle with the mastoid element. The anteroinferior border, thin above and thick below, meets the greater wing of the sphenoid bone; it is bevelled internally above, and bevelled externally below.</div><div class="text" id="p0030">The squamous part has a zygomatic process and a mandibular fossa.</div><section><a id="s0025"/><h4 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0030">Zygomatic process</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0035">The zygomatic process juts forwards from the lower region of the squamous part. Its triangular posterior aspect has a broad base that is directed laterally, presenting superior and inferior surfaces. The zygomatic process then twists anteromedially, so that its surfaces become medial and lateral.</div><div class="text" id="p0040">The superior surface of the posterior part is concave. The inferior surface is bounded by anterior and posterior roots, converging into the anterior part of the process. The tubercle of the zygomatic root gives attachment to the lateral temporomandibular ligament at the junction of the roots. The posterior root is prolonged forwards above the external acoustic meatus, its upper border continuing into the supramastoid crest. Very rarely, the squamous part is perforated above the posterior root by a squamosal foramen, which transmits the petrosquamous sinus. The anterior root juts almost horizontally from the squamous part. Its inferior surface, with an anteroposterior convexity, forms a short semi-cylindrical articular tubercle and comes into contact with the articular disc of the temporomandibular joint. The tubercle forms the anterior limit of the mandibular fossa.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">The anterior part of the zygomatic process is thin and flat, and the temporal fascia is attached to its superior border. The inferior border is short and arched and gives origin to some fibres of masseter. The lateral surface is convex. The medial surface is concave and provides further attachment for part of masseter. The anterior end is deeply serrated and slopes obliquely posteroinferiorly to articulate with the temporal process of the zygomatic bone, forming the zygomatic arch. Anterior to the articular tubercle, a small triangular area forms part of the roof of the infratemporal fossa; it is continuous behind with the anterior root and in front with the infratemporal crest of the greater wing of the sphenoid.</div></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0035">Mandibular fossa</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0050">The mandibular fossa is limited in front by the articular eminence of the zygomatic process. It presents an anterior articular area, formed by the squamous part, and a posterior non-articular area, formed by the tympanic element. The articular surface is smooth, oval and concave, and contacts the articular disc of the temporomandibular joint. Unlike most other synovial joints, it is lined by fibrous tissue rather than hyaline cartilage, reflecting its intramembranous development. The non-articular area sometimes contains part of the parotid gland. A small, conical postglenoid tubercle separates the articular surface laterally from the tympanic plate.</div><div class="text" id="p0055">Posteriorly, the mandibular fossa is separated from the tympanic part by the squamotympanic fissure. Rarely, a postglenoid foramen exists anterior to the external acoustic meatus in the line of fusion of the squamous and tympanic parts. When present, it replaces the squamosal foramen noted above and transmits the petrosquamous sinus. Medially, a projection from the petrous part of the temporal bone (tegmen tympani) comes to lie within the squamotympanic fissure, further dividing it into petrotympanic and petrosquamous fissures. The petrotympanic fissure leads into the tympanic cavity and contains an anterior malleolar ligament and the anterior tympanic branch of the maxillary artery. The anterior opening of the anterior canaliculus for the chorda tympani nerve lies at the medial end of the fissure.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0040">Petromastoid part</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0060">The petromastoid part of the temporal bone, although morphologically one element, is more conveniently described as two parts, namely: mastoid and petrous parts.</div><section><a id="s0040"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0045">Mastoid part</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0065">The mastoid part is the posterior region of the temporal bone and has an outer surface roughened by the attachments of the occipital belly of occipitofrontalis and auricularis posterior. A mastoid foramen, of variable size, number and position, traversed by a vein from the sigmoid sinus and a small dural branch of the occipital artery, frequently lies near its posterior border. The foramen may be in the occipital or occipitotemporal suture; it may sometimes be parasutural or may be absent. The mean length of the mastoid emissary vein from its point of origin to its point of termination is 7.2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm (range 3.8–11.8<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm). It can be a significant source of bleeding in retrosigmoid and far lateral approaches to the skull base, usually controlled by the repetitive applications of surgical wax. It is of considerable clinical importance to craniofacial surgeons when operating on complex craniosynostotic patients, where the emissary vein may be the sole dominant drainage pathway of the brain (<a href="#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_19">Louis et al 2009</a>, <a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Kim et al 2014</a>).<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="736" id="pagebreak_736"/><a id="pg736"/></div><div class="text" id="p0070">The mastoid part projects down as the conical mastoid process and is larger in adult males. Sternocleidomastoid, splenius capitis and longissimus capitis are all attached to its lateral surface, and the posterior belly of digastric is attached to a deep mastoid notch on its medial aspect. The occipital artery runs in a shallow occipital groove that lies medial to the mastoid notch. The internal surface of the mastoid process bears a deep, curved sigmoid sulcus for the sigmoid venous sinus; the sulcus is separated from the underlying innermost mastoid air cells by a thin lamina of bone.</div><div class="text" id="p0075">The superior border of the mastoid part is thick and serrated for articulation with the mastoid angle of the parietal bone. The posterior border is also serrated and articulates with the inferior border of the occipital bone between its lateral angle and jugular process. The mastoid element is fused with the descending process of the squamous part; below, it appears in the posterior wall of the tympanic cavity.</div></section><section><a id="s0045"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0050">Petrous part</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0080">The petrous part is a mass of bone that is wedged between the sphenoid and occipital bones in the cranial base; it contains the labyrinth. It is inclined superiorly and anteromedially, and has a base, apex, three surfaces (anterior, posterior and inferior) and three borders (superior, posterior and anterior).</div><div class="text" id="p0085">The base would correspond to the part that lies on the base of the skull and is separated from the squamous part by a suture. However, this suture disappears soon after birth. The subsequent development of the mastoid processes means that the precise boundaries of the base are no longer identifiable.</div><div class="text" id="p0090">The apex, blunt and irregular, is angled between the posterior border of the greater wing of the sphenoid and the basilar part of the occipital bone. It contains the anterior opening of the carotid canal and limits the foramen lacerum posterolaterally.</div><div class="text" id="p0095">The anterior surface contributes to the floor of the middle cranial fossa (<a href="../B9780702077050000343/B9780702077050000343.xhtml">Ch. 34</a>) and is continuous with the cerebral surface of the squamous part (although the petrosquamosal suture often persists late in life). The whole surface is adapted to the inferior temporal gyrus. Behind the apex is a trigeminal impression for the trigeminal ganglion. Bone anterolateral to this impression roofs the anterior part of the carotid canal but is often deficient. A ridge separates the trigeminal impression from another hollow behind, which partly roofs the internal acoustic meatus and cochlea. This, in turn, is limited behind by the arcuate eminence, which is raised by the superior (anterior) semicircular canal but is not necessarily directly over it. Laterally, the anterior surface roofs the vestibule and, partly, the facial canal. Between the squamous part laterally and the arcuate eminence and the hollows just described medially, the anterior surface is formed by the tegmen tympani, a thin plate of bone that forms the roof of the mastoid antrum and extends forwards above the tympanic cavity and the canal for tensor tympani. The lateral margin of the tegmen tympani meets the squamous part at the petrosquamosal suture, turning down in front as the lateral wall of the canal for tensor tympani and the osseous part of the pharyngotympanic tube; its lower edge is in the squamotympanic fissure. Anteriorly, the tegmen bears a narrow groove related to the greater petrosal nerve (which passes posterolaterally to enter the bone by a hiatus anterior to the arcuate eminence). The groove passes forwards to the foramen lacerum. A smaller and similar hiatus and groove may be found more laterally; they are related to the lesser petrosal nerve (which runs to the foramen ovale). The posterior slope of the arcuate eminence overlies the posterior and lateral semicircular canals. Lateral to the eminence, the posterior part of the tegmen tympani roofs the mastoid antrum.</div><div class="text" id="p0100">The posterior surface contributes to the anterior part of the posterior cranial fossa and is continuous with the internal surface of the mastoid part. The opening of the internal acoustic meatus lies near its centre. A small slit leading to the vestibular aqueduct lies behind the opening of the meatus, almost hidden by a thin plate of bone. This contains the saccus and ductus endolymphaticus together with a small artery and vein. The terminal half of the saccus endolymphaticus protrudes through the slit between the periosteum and dura mater. The subarcuate fossa lies above these openings.</div><div class="text" id="p0105">The irregular inferior surface is part of the exterior of the cranial base. Near the apex of the petrous part, a quadrilateral area is partly associated with the attachment of levator veli palatini and the cartilaginous pharyngotympanic tube, and partly connected to the basilar part of the occipital bone by dense fibrocartilage. Behind this region is the large, circular opening of the carotid canal, and behind the opening of the canal is the jugular fossa, which is of variable depth and size, and contains the superior jugular bulb. The inferior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve lies in a triangular depression anteromedial to the jugular fossa (below the internal acoustic meatus). At its apex is a small opening into the cochlear canaliculus, occupied by the perilymphatic duct (a tube of dura mater) and a vein draining from the cochlea to the internal jugular vein. A canaliculus for the tympanic nerve from the glossopharyngeal nerve lies on the ridge between the carotid canal and the jugular fossa. The mastoid canaliculus for the auricular branch of the vagus nerve is laterally positioned in the jugular fossa. Behind the jugular fossa, the rough quadrilateral jugular surface is covered by cartilage that joins it to the jugular process of the occipital bone.</div><div class="text" id="p0110">The superior border, the longest, is grooved by the superior petrosal sinus. The attached margin of the tentorium cerebelli is fixed to the edges of the groove except at its medial end, where it is crossed by the roots of the trigeminal nerve. The posterior border, intermediate in length, bears a sulcus medially, which forms, together with the occipital bone, a gutter for the inferior petrosal sinus. Behind this, the jugular fossa contributes (together with the occipital bone) to the jugular foramen and is notched by the glossopharyngeal nerve. Bone on either or both sides of the jugular notch may meet the occipital bone and divide the jugular foramen into two or three parts. The anterior border is joined laterally to the squamous part of the temporal bone at the petrosquamosal suture; medially, it articulates with the greater wing of the sphenoid bone.</div><div class="text" id="p0115">Two canals exist at the junction of the petrous and squamous parts, one above the other, separated by a thin osseous plate and both leading to the tympanic cavity; the upper canal contains tensor tympani, while the lower canal is the pharyngotympanic tube.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0050"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0055">Tympanic part</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0120">The tympanic part of the temporal bone is a curved plate below the squamous part and anterior to the mastoid process. Internally, it fuses with the petrous part and appears between this and the squamous part, where it is inferolateral to the auditory orifice. Behind, it fuses with the squamous part and mastoid process, and is the anterior limit of the tympanomastoid fissure. Its concave posterior surface forms the anterior wall, floor and part of the posterior wall of the external acoustic meatus. The tympanic membrane is attached to a narrow tympanic sulcus on its medial surface. The quadrilateral concave anterior surface is the posterior wall of the mandibular fossa and may contact the parotid gland. Its rough lateral border forms most of the margin of the osseous part of the external acoustic meatus and is continuous with its cartilaginous part. Laterally, the upper border is fused with the back of the postglenoid tubercle; medially, it forms the posterior edge of the petrotympanic fissure. The inferior border is sharp and splits laterally to form, at its root, the sheath of the styloid process (vaginal process). Centrally, the tympanic part is thin and is often perforated. The stylomastoid foramen lies between the styloid and mastoid processes; it represents the external end of the facial canal, contains part of the aponeurosis of the posterior belly of digastric, and transmits the facial nerve and stylomastoid artery.</div></section><section><a id="s0055"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0060">Styloid process</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0125">The styloid process is slender and pointed, and projects anteroinferiorly from the inferior aspect of the temporal bone. Its length may vary considerably, normally ranging from 2.83 to 4.16<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm. In some patients it may be much longer and be the cause of severe, neuralgic pain in the ipsilateral pharynx when swallowing (Eagle’s syndrome) as the glossopharyngeal nerve rubs against the process. Mechanical impingement of the cervical carotid artery with an excessively long styloid process has been implicated as a cause of arterial dissection with the consequences that flow from that (<a href="#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_24">Muthusami 2013</a>, <a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_13">Jelodar et al 2018</a>, <a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Ledesma-Montes et al 2018</a>). Most often the styloid process is almost straight but can show a curvature, an anteromedial concavity being most common. Its proximal part (tympanohyal) is ensheathed by the tympanic plate, especially anterolaterally, while muscles and ligaments are attached to its distal part (stylohyal). <span class="italic">In vivo</span>, its relationships are important. The styloid process is covered laterally by the parotid gland; the facial nerve crosses its base; the external carotid artery crosses its tip, embedded in the parotid; and medially, the process is separated from the beginning of the internal jugular vein by the attachment of stylopharyngeus.</div></section><section><a id="s0060"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0065">External acoustic meatus</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0130">The temporal bone contains the bony (osseous) part of the external acoustic meatus.</div></section><section><a id="s0065"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0070">Ossification</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0135">The four temporal components ossify independently (<a href="#f0015">Fig. 42.2</a>). The squamous part is ossified in a sheet of condensed mesenchyme from a single centre near the zygomatic roots, which appears in embryonic <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="738" id="pagebreak_738"/><a id="pg738"/>stages 21–23 (postfertilization week 8). The petromastoid part has several centres that appear in the cartilaginous otic capsule during postmenstrual weeks 17–20; as many as 14 have been described. These centres vary in order of appearance. Several are small and inconstant and soon fuse with others. The otic capsule is almost fully ossified by postmenstrual week 24. The tympanic part is also ossified in mesenchyme from four centres that appear at about postmenstrual week 14. At birth, it is an incomplete tympanic ring that is deficient above; its concavity is grooved by a tympanic sulcus for the tympanic membrane. The malleolar sulcus housing the anterior malleolar process, chorda tympani and anterior tympanic artery, inclines obliquely downwards and forwards across the medial aspect of the anterior part of the ring. The styloid process develops from two centres at the cranial end of the cartilage in the second visceral or hyoid arch: a proximal centre for the tympanohyal appears before birth, and the centre for the distal stylohyal appears after birth. The tympanic ring unites with the squamous part shortly before birth; the petromastoid fuses with it and the tympanohyal during the first postnatal year. The stylohyal does not unite with the rest of the process until after puberty and may never do so.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000422/main.assets/f42-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 42.2</span> The left temporal bone at birth. <br/><span class="figcredit">Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy © Elsevier GmbH, Urban &amp; Fischer, Munich.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0140">Once ossified, the tympanic cavity, mastoid antrum and the posterior end of the pharyngotympanic tube become surrounded by bone. The petrous part forms the roof, floor and medial wall of the cavity, while the squamous and tympanic parts, together with the tympanic membrane, form its lateral wall. At birth, the middle and inner ears are adult size, and the tympanic cavity, mastoid antrum, tympanic membrane and auditory ossicles are all almost adult size. The anterior process does not join the malleus until 6 months later. The internal acoustic meatus is approximately 6<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm in horizontal diameter, 4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm in vertical diameter and 7<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm in length at birth, and the adult diameters are 7.7<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm and 11<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm, respectively.</div><div class="text" id="p0145">After birth and apart from general growth, the tympanic ring extends posterolaterally to become cylindrical, growing into a fibrocartilaginous tympanic plate, which forms the adjacent part of the external acoustic meatus at this stage. This growth is not equal but is rapid in the anterior and posterior regions, which meet and blend. Thus, for a time, an opening (foramen of Huschke) exists in the floor; it usually closes at about the fifth year but is sometimes permanent. The external acoustic meatus is relatively as long in children as it is in adults, but the canal is fibrocartilaginous, whereas its medial two-thirds are osseous in adults. Surgical access to the tympanic cavity is via the mastoid antrum, and in children it is necessary to remove only a thin scale of bone in the suprameatal triangle to reach the antrum. The tympanic plate ensheathes the styloid process by posterior extension and extends medially over the petrous bone to the carotid canal.</div><div class="text" id="p0150">Initially, the mandibular fossa is shallow, facing more laterally, but it then deepens and ultimately faces downwards. Posteroinferiorly, the squamous part grows down behind the tympanic ring to form the lateral wall of the mastoid antrum. The mastoid part is at first flat, so that the stylomastoid foramen and rudimentary styloid process are immediately behind the tympanic ring. The mastoid part becomes invaded by air cells, especially at puberty. The lateral mastoid region grows downwards and forwards to form the mastoid process, which means that the styloid process and stylomastoid foramen become inferior. Descent of the foramen lengthens the facial canal. The mastoid process is not perceptible until late in the second year; consequently, the facial nerve is relatively superficial and susceptible to damage during surgical exploration during this period. The subarcuate fossa gradually fills and is almost obliterated.</div><div class="text" id="p0155">In the neonate, the petrous and squamous parts of the temporal bone are usually partially separated by the petrosquamous fissure, which opens directly into the mastoid antrum of the middle ear. Rarely, the fissure closes in infants during the first year, but it sometimes remains unclosed up to the age of 19 years and can be a route for the spread of infection from the middle ear to the meninges. There is a bimodal growth pattern in the lateral surface dimensions of the temporal bone in children; marked increases in dimension take place from birth to the age of 4 years but little growth is seen between the ages of 4 and 20 years (<a href="#bib35" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_35">Simms and Neely 1989</a>). The neonatal pharyngotympanic tube (Eustachian tube) is about half the length of its adult counterpart. Its opening from the middle ear cavity is as large as it is in the adult but the pharyngeal opening in the nasal part of the pharynx is relatively smaller. The course of the pharyngotympanic tube is horizontal in the newborn, whereas in the adult it passes from the middle ear downwards, forwards and medially.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0070"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0075">External Ear</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0160">The external ear consists of the auricle (pinna) and the external acoustic meatus. The auricle projects to a variable and individual degree from the side of the head. It collects sound waves and conducts them along the external acoustic meatus inwards towards the ear drum, the tympanic membrane. The auricle thus acts as the first element of a series of stimulus modifiers in the auditory apparatus.</div><section><a id="s0075"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0080">Auricle (pinna)</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0165">The lateral surface of the auricle is irregularly concave, faces slightly forwards, and displays numerous eminences and depressions (<a href="#f0020">Fig. 42.3</a>). It has a prominent curved rim, the helix. This usually bears a small tubercle posterosuperiorly, Darwin’s tubercle, which is quite pronounced during postmenstrual weeks 21–24. The antihelix is a curved prominence, parallel and anterior to the posterior part of the helix; it divides above into two crura that flank a depressed triangular fossa. The curved depression between the helix and antihelix is the scaphoid fossa. The antihelix encircles the deep, capacious concha of the auricle, which is incompletely divided by the crus or anterior end of the helix.

It is thin, has no dermal papillae, and is closely adherent to the cartilaginous and osseous parts of the canal; inflammation of the canal skin is very painful because of this firm attachment to the underlying structures. The thick subcutaneous tissue of the cartilaginous part of the meatus contains numerous ceruminous glands that secrete wax, or cerumen. Their coiled tubular structure resembles that of sweat glands. The secretory cells are columnar when active but cuboidal when quiescent; they are covered externally by myoepithelial cells. Ducts open either on to the epithelial surface or into the nearby sebaceous gland of a hair follicle. Cerumen prevents the maceration of meatal skin by trapped water. Antibacterial properties have been attributed to cerumen but the evidence for this is lacking (<a href="#bib7" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_7">Campos et al 2000</a>, <a href="#bib27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_27">Pata et al 2003</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0190">Two types of wax, wet and dry, are recognized.

Although ceruminous glands and hair follicles are largely limited to the cartilaginous meatus, a few small glands and fine hairs are also present in the roof of the lateral part of the bony meatus.

There is no cartilage in the lobule or between the tragus and the crus of the helix, where the gap is filled by dense fibrous tissue.

The cranial aspect of the cartilage bears the eminentia conchae and eminentia scaphae, which correspond to the depressions on the lateral surface.

The canal skin is then elevated from the underlying bone until the fibrous anulus of the tympanic membrane is visualized. This can then be elevated from the tympanic groove and the middle ear mucosa incised to allow the tympanic membrane to be reflected forwards and upwards.

This gives more space to manipulate the delicate structures of the middle ear, as well as improving subsequent visualization of the tympanic membrane when the incision has healed.</div><div class="text" id="p0315">The postauricular approach involves making an incision approximately 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm behind the postauricular skin crease and deepening the incision to the periosteum of the mastoid process, dividing the posterior auricular muscles on the way.

The skin over the junction of the bony and cartilaginous meatus is incised to allow the cartilage of the auricle and meatus to be swung forwards on its blood supply and so expose the bony meatus and mastoid process.

It is lined with mucous membrane and filled with air, which reaches it from the nasopharynx via the pharyngotympanic tube (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 42.6</a>; <a href="#f0040">Fig. 42.7</a>). The middle ear contains three small bones – the malleus, incus and stapes, collectively called the auditory ossicles – which form an articulated chain connecting the lateral and medial walls of the cavity, and which transmit the vibrations of the tympanic membrane across the cavity to the cochlea.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0040"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000422/main.assets/f42-07-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0070"/><a id="fspara0070"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 42.7</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, An axial CT scan at the level of the ossicular mass (white arrow) in the epitympanum, showing the mastoid antrum and its relationship to the lateral (horizontal) semicircular canal (black arrow). <span class="bold">B</span>, An axial CT scan at the level of the entrance of the pharyngotympanic tube, showing its relationship to the internal carotid artery (black arrow).

Mechanical coupling between the two systems must match their resistance to deformation or ‘flow’, i.e. their impedance, as closely as possible. Aerial waves of low amplitude and low force per unit area arrive at the tympanic membrane, which has 15–20 times the area of the stapedial footplate that contacts the perilymph in the inner ear; the force per unit area generated by the footplate is increased by a similar amount, while the amplitude of vibration is almost unchanged.</div><div class="text" id="p0350">Protective mechanisms incorporated into the design of the middle ear include the presence of the pharyngotympanic tube (to equalize pressure on both sides of the delicate tympanic membrane); the shape of the articulations between the ossicles; and the reflex contractions of stapedius and tensor tympani in response to sounds of fairly high intensity (preventing damage caused by sudden or excessive excursions of the ossicles).</div><div class="text" id="p0355">The space within the middle ear can be subdivided into three parts. These are the mesotympanum or tympanic cavity proper, which is opposite the tympanic membrane; the epitympanum or attic, which is above the level of the membrane, and contains the head of the malleus and the body and short process of the incus; and the hypotympanum, which is in the floor of the cavity between the jugular bulb and the lower margin of the tympanic membrane. The vertical and anteroposterior diameters of the mesotympanum and hypotympanum are each approximately 15<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm; the transverse diameter is 6<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm superiorly and 4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm inferiorly, narrowing to 2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm opposite the umbo. The cavity is bounded laterally by the tympanic membrane and medially by the lateral wall of the internal ear, the promontory. It communicates posteriorly with the mastoid antrum and the mastoid air cells, and anteriorly with the nasopharynx via the pharyngotympanic tube (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 42.6</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0360">The tympanic cavity and mastoid antrum, auditory ossicles and structures of the internal ear are all almost fully developed at birth and subsequently alter little; almost all of the volume changes are due to expansion of the epitympanic space (<a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_26">Osborn et al 2011</a>). In the fetus, the cavity contains a gelatinous tissue that has practically disappeared by birth, when it is filled by a fluid that is absorbed when air enters via the pharyngotympanic tube.

It is prolonged posteriorly as the roof of the mastoid antrum and anteriorly it covers the canal for tensor tympani. In youth, the unossified petrosquamosal suture may allow the spread of infection from the tympanic cavity to the meninges. In adults, veins from the tympanic cavity traverse this suture to reach the superior petrosal or petrosquamous sinus and thus may also transmit infection to these structures through a process of thrombophlebitis.</div><div class="text" id="p0375">Longitudinal fractures of the middle cranial fossa almost always involve the tympanic roof, accompanied by dislocation of the ossicular chain, rupture of the tympanic membrane, or a fractured roof of the osseous external acoustic meatus, which can be seen as a notch on otoscopy. Such injuries usually cause bleeding from the ear, with escape of cerebrospinal fluid if the dura mater has been torn (CSF otorrhoea).</div></section><section><a id="s0270"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0215">Floor</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0380">The floor of the tympanic cavity is a narrow, thin, convex plate of bone that separates the cavity from the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein. The bone may be patchily deficient, in which case the tympanic cavity and the vein are separated only by mucous membrane and fibrous tissue. Alternatively, the floor is sometimes thick and may contain some accessory mastoid air cells. A small aperture for the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve lies near the medial wall.</div></section><section><a id="s0275"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0220">Lateral wall</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0385">The lateral wall consists mainly of the tympanic membrane but also contains the ring of bone to which the membrane is attached. The lateral epitympanic bony wall is wedge-shaped in section and its sharp inferior portion is known as the outer attic wall or scutum. This part is easily eroded or blunted by cholesteatoma, a feature easily detected on computed tomography (CT) scans. There is a deficiency or notch in the upper part of this ring, close to which are the small openings of the anterior and posterior canaliculi for the chorda tympani and the petrotympanic fissure. The posterior canaliculus for the chorda tympani is situated in the angle between the posterior and lateral walls of the tympanic cavity just behind the tympanic membrane, at a variable position approximately level with the upper end of the handle of the malleus. This variable position or entrance into the tympanic cavity should be kept in mind when mobilizing the chorda tympani in stapes surgery. It may not reflect inferiorly to the extent desired and can be easily damaged in the process. Within the mastoid, the chorda tympani passes into a minute canal that descends in front of the facial canal and ends in it about 6<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm above the stylomastoid foramen. This canal and the chorda tympani should not be mistaken for the main trunk of the facial nerve when skeletonizing the facial (Fallopian) canal during surgery. The canaliculus transmits the chorda tympani and a branch of the stylomastoid artery to the tympanic cavity. The chorda tympani leaves the tympanic cavity through the anterior canaliculus, which opens at the medial end of the petrotympanic fissure.</div><div class="text" id="p0390">The petrotympanic fissure is a mere slit approximately 2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm in length, which opens just above and in front of the ring of bone to which the tympanic membrane is attached.

It is thin, semi-transparent and almost oval, though somewhat broader above than below. It lies obliquely, at an angle of approximately 55° with the meatal floor in adults. Its longest, anteroinferior diameter is 9–10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm, and its shortest is 8–9<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm. Most of its circumference is a thickened fibrocartilaginous ring or anulus, which is attached to the tympanic sulcus at the medial end of the meatus. The anulus contains radially orientated smooth muscle cells in several locations that possibly play a role in controlling blood flow or maintaining tension (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Henson et al 2005</a>). The sulcus is deficient superiorly, i.e. it is notched. Two bands, the anterior and posterior malleolar folds, pass from the ends of this notch to the lateral process of the malleus. The small triangular part of the membrane, the pars flaccida, lies above these folds and is lax and thin. The major part of the tympanic membrane, the pars tensa, is taut. The handle of the malleus is firmly attached to the internal surface of the tympanic membrane as far as its centre, which projects towards the tympanic cavity. The inner surface of the membrane is thus convex and the point of greatest convexity is termed the umbo. Although the membrane as a whole is convex on its inner surface, its radiating fibres are curved with their concavities directed inwards.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0045"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000422/main.assets/f42-08-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0040"/><a id="fspara0040"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 42.8</span> An auroscopic view of the left tympanic membrane.

It is keratinized, stratified squamous in type, devoid of dermal papillae and hairless. Its subepithelial tissue is vascularized and may develop a few peripheral papillae. Ultrastructurally, it is typically 10 cells thick and has two zones: a superficial layer of non-nucleated squames, and a deep zone that resembles the epidermal prickle cell layer (stratum spinosum). There are numerous desmosomes between cells, the deepest of which lie on a continuous basal lamina but lack epithelial pegs and hemidesmosomes. The cells of this stratum have a propensity for lateral migration and differentiation not shared with any other stratified squamous epithelia in the body.</div><div class="text" id="p0410">The fibrous stratum consists of an external layer of radiating fibres that diverge from the handle of the malleus, and a deep layer of circular fibres, which are plentiful peripherally but sparse and scattered centrally.

They have a distinctive amino acid composition and may consist of a protein peculiar to the tympanic membrane. Small groups of collagen fibrils appear at 11 postmenstrual weeks, interspersed with small bundles of elastin microfibrils. Older specimens contain more typically cross-banded collagen fibrils and an amorphous elastin component. The fibrous stratum is replaced by loose connective tissue in the pars flaccida.</div><div class="text" id="p0415">The mucous stratum is a part of the mucosa of the tympanic cavity and is thickest near the upper part of the membrane. It consists of a single layer of very flat cells, with overlapping interdigitating boundaries and desmosomes and tight junctions between adjacent cells. The cytoplasm contains only a few organelles; the luminal surfaces of these apparently metabolically inert cells have a few irregular microvilli and are covered by an amorphous electron-dense material. There are no ciliated columnar cells.</div></section><section><a id="s0290"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0235">Innervation</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0420">The tympanic membrane is mainly innervated by the auriculotemporal nerve and appears to perceive only pain. There is a minor, inconstant and overlapping sensory supply from the facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves.</div><div class="text" id="p0425">The auricular branch of the vagus arises from the superior vagal ganglion and is joined soon after by a ramus from the inferior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve. It passes behind the internal jugular vein and enters the mastoid canaliculus on the lateral wall of the jugular fossa. It traverses the temporal bone and crosses the facial canal about 4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm above the stylomastoid foramen. At this point, it supplies an ascending branch to the facial nerve. Fibres of the nervus intermedius may pass to the auricular branch of the vagus here, which may explain the cutaneous vesiculation that sometimes accompanies geniculate herpes. The auricular branch then traverses the tympanomastoid fissure and divides into two rami. One ramus joins the posterior auricular nerve and the other is distributed to the skin of part of the cranial surface of the auricle, the posterior wall and floor of the external acoustic meatus, and to the adjoining part of the outer surface of the tympanic membrane. The auricular branch therefore contains somatic afferent nerve fibres, which probably terminate in the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Stimulation of the vagus nerve, e.g. in syringing the ear, can cause a reflex bradycardic reaction on heart rate. From a practical point of view, the tympanic membrane can be anaesthetized for minor procedures like myringotomy by the application of topical anaesthetic agents. For more complicated surgical procedures, e.g. tympanoplasty, it is possible to provide sufficient anaesthesia by local infiltration at the level of the bony and cartilaginous external acoustic meatus.</div></section><section><a id="s0295"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0240">Otitis media</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0430">It is assumed that acute otitis media usually arises as a result of ascending infection from the nasopharynx via the pharyngotympanic tube to the middle ear cleft. From there, it may extend to the mastoid aditus and antrum. Swelling secondary to the infection may result in the closure of both exits from the middle ear, i.e. the pharyngotympanic tube and the aditus, with subsequent accumulation of pus under pressure, which causes lateral bulging and inflammation of the tympanic membrane. The latter may burst, releasing mucopurulent discharge into the external acoustic meatus, which results in a release of the pressure in the middle ear and a diminution in the levels of pain. After a brief period, the discharge dries up and, for the most part, the resultant perforation of the tympanic membrane heals. Normal ventilation and drainage of mucus from the middle ear are restored once the swelling and function of the pharyngotympanic tube resolve. On occasion, the process will fail to produce a perforation of the tympanic membrane and the inflammatory exudates will not drain. The immune defence system sterilizes the exudates of organisms, resulting in a sterile mucoid effusion, otitis media with effusion or glue ear (see below). The effusion may cause protracted deafness because its relatively incompressible nature prevents free vibration of the tympanic membrane (<a href="#bib6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_6">Bluestone and Klein 2002</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0300"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0245">Myringoplasty</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0435">Persistent perforation of the tympanic membrane caused by infection or trauma leads to hearing impairment and predisposes to continuing infection as a result of contamination with organisms from the external acoustic meatus. This condition is known as chronic suppurative otitis media of the tubotympanic type. Myringoplasty is a surgical procedure that uses a connective tissue scaffold or graft to support healing of the perforation. The most common technique involves the elevation of the tympanic anulus and the placement of a piece of fibrous connective tissue, e.g. part of the fibrous deep fascia that invests the lateral surface of temporalis or the perichondrium of the tragal cartilage, on to the undersurface of the tympanic membrane to close the perforation. The healed <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="745" id="pagebreak_745"/><a id="pg745"/>edges of the perforation are stripped of epithelium to encourage healing and scar formation. The fibrous tissue supports the healing tympanic membrane and may, in part, be incorporated into the repair.

The fenestra cochleae lies completely under the overhanging edge of the promontory in a deep hollow or niche, and is placed very obliquely. In dried specimens, it opens anterosuperiorly from the tympanic cavity into the scala tympani of the cochlea, but in life it is closed by the secondary tympanic membrane. This is somewhat concave towards the tympanic cavity and convex towards the cochlea. It is bent so that its posterosuperior third forms an angle with its anteroinferior two-thirds.

Its topographical relations are of considerable surgical importance. The aditus to the mastoid antrum, which leads back from the epitympanic recess, opens in the upper part of its anterior wall. The lateral semicircular canal lies medial to the aditus. The descending part of the facial nerve canal is anteroinferior. The medial wall is related to the posterior semicircular canal. The sigmoid sinus lies some distance posteriorly; the distance can be extremely variable and is dependent on the degree of pneumatization of the mastoid. The roof is formed by the tegmen tympani, and so the antrum lies below the middle cranial fossa and the temporal lobe of the brain. The floor has several openings that communicate with the mastoid air cells. The lateral wall, which offers the usual surgical approach to the cavity, is formed by the postmeatal process of the squamous part of the temporal bone.

As the mastoid develops in the second year, the air cells gradually extend into it and by the fourth year they are well formed, although their greatest growth occurs at puberty. They vary considerably in number, form and size. Usually, they interconnect and are lined by a mucosa with squamous non-ciliated epithelium, continuous with that in the mastoid antrum and tympanic cavity. They may fill the mastoid process, even to its tip, and some may be separated from the sigmoid sinus and posterior cranial fossa only by extremely thin bone, which is occasionally deficient (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 42.9</a>). Some may lie superficial to, or even behind, the sigmoid sinus, and others may be present in the posterior wall of the descending part of the facial nerve canal. Those in the squamous part of the temporal bone may be separated from deeper cells in the petrous part by a plate of bone in the line of the squamomastoid suture (Körner’s septum). Sometimes, they extend only minimally into the mastoid process, in which case the process consists largely of dense bone or trabecular bone containing bone marrow. Varieties of the mastoid process are recognized. The three types most commonly described are pneumatized (with many air cells); sclerotic or diploic (with few or no air cells); and mixed (contain both air cells and bone marrow).</div><div class="text" id="p0500">The mastoid process may sometimes have no air cells at all. Alternatively, air cells may extend beyond the mastoid process into the squamous part of the temporal bone above the supramastoid crest; into the posterior root of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone; into the osseous roof of the external acoustic meatus just below the middle cranial fossa; or into the floor of the tympanic cavity very close to the superior jugular bulb. Rarely, a few may excavate the jugular process of the occipital bone. An important group may extend medially into the petrous part of the temporal bone, even to its apex, and are related to the pharyngotympanic tube, carotid canal, labyrinth and abducens nerve. Some investigators maintain that these are not continuous with the mastoid cells but grow independently from the tympanic cavity. All of these extensions of the mastoid air cells are pathologically important since infection may spread to the structures around them.

It is perforated by the superior and inferior caroticotympanic nerves and the tympanic branch or branches of the internal carotid. The canals for tensor tympani and the osseous part of the pharyngotympanic tube open above it, the canal for tensor tympani being superior to that for the pharyngotympanic tube. Both canals incline downwards and anteromedially, to open in the angle between the squamous and petrous parts of the temporal bone, and are separated by a thin, osseous septum. The canal for tensor tympani and the bony septum runs posterolaterally on the medial tympanic wall and ends immediately above the fenestra vestibuli. Here, the posterior end of the septum is curved laterally to form a pulley, the processus cochleariformis (cochleariform process), which is a surgical landmark for the identification of the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve.

The tube also carries mucus from the middle ear cleft to the nasopharynx as a result of ciliary transport.</div><div class="text" id="p0530">In children, the pharyngotympanic tube is relatively narrow. It is prone to obstruction when the mucosa swells in response to infection or allergic challenge; obstruction results in a relative vacuum being created in the middle ear secondary to transmucosal gas exchange, and this in turn promotes mucosal secretion and the formation of a middle ear effusion. Because of the collapsibility of the pharyngotympanic tube, the vacuum thus created can overcome the distending effect of the muscles of the tube and ‘lock’ the tube shut. The resultant persistent middle ear effusion, otitis media with effusion (glue ear), can cause <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="747" id="pagebreak_747"/><a id="pg747"/>hearing loss by splinting the tympanic membrane and impeding its vibration. It can also provide an ideal environment for the proliferation of bacteria, with the result that an acute otitis media may develop (see above). It is possible to relieve the vacuum and unlock the tube, and then remove the effusion by myringotomy, i.e. by surgically creating a hole in the tympanic membrane. This hole will generally heal rapidly, and it is common practice to insert a flanged ventilation tube (a grommet or tympanostomy tube) to keep the hole open. Migration of the outer squamous layer of the tympanic membrane eventually displaces the tube and the myringotomy heals.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0355"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0290">Auditory ossicles</h3><div class="textfl" id="p9520">A chain of three mobile ossicles – the malleus, incus and stapes – transfers sound waves across the tympanic cavity from the tympanic membrane to the fenestra vestibuli.

Its lower end bends medially and ends in a rounded lenticular process, the medial surface of which is covered with cartilage and articulates with the head of the stapes. The short process, somewhat conical, projects backwards and is attached by ligamentous fibres to the fossa incudis in the lower and posterior part of the epitympanic recess.

The latter, like the anterior malleolar ligament, is derived from the perichondrial sheath of Meckel’s cartilage. The anterior malleolar ligament may contain muscle fibres, called laxator tympani or musculus externus mallei. The lateral ligament of the malleus is a triangular band that stretches from the posterior part of the border of the tympanic incisure to the head of the malleus.

The incudomalleolar joint is saddle-shaped and the incudostapedial joint is a ball and socket articulation. The articular surfaces are covered with articular cartilage, and each joint is enveloped by a capsule that is rich in elastic tissue and lined by synovial membrane. Versican, fibronectin, elastin and hyaluronan have been co-localized in the attachments of tensor tympani and stapedius to the malleus and stapes, respectively, and in the anular ligament of the incudostapedial joint in histological sections of adult middle ears (<a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_14">Kawase et al 2012</a>).

The malleus and incus rotate together around an axis that runs from the short process and posterior ligament of the incus to the anterior ligament of the malleus. When the tympanic membrane and handle of the malleus move inwards (medially), the long process of the incus moves in the same direction and pushes the stapedial footplate towards the labyrinth and the perilymph contained within the labyrinth. The movement of the perilymph causes a compensatory outward bulging of the secondary tympanic membrane. These events are reversed when the tympanic membrane moves outwards. If the movement of the tympanic membrane is considerable, the incus does not follow the full outward excursion of the malleus and merely glides on it at the incudomalleolar joint, so preventing a dislocation of the footplate of the stapes from the fenestra vestibuli. When the handle of the malleus is carried medially, the spur at the lower margin of the head of the malleus locks the incudomalleolar joint, and this necessitates an inward movement of the long process of the incus. The joint is unlocked again when the handle of the malleus is carried outwards. The three bones together act as a bent lever so that the stapedial footplate does not move in the fenestra vestibuli like a piston, but rocks on a fulcrum at its anteroinferior border where the anular ligament is thick. The rocking movement around a vertical axis, which is like a swinging door, is said to happen only at moderate intensities of sound. With loud, low-pitched sounds, the axis becomes horizontal, and the upper and lower margins of the stapedial footplate oscillate in opposite directions around this central axis, thus preventing excessive displacement of the perilymph.</div></section><section><a id="s0405"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0340">Otosclerosis and other causes of stapes fixation, stapedectomy and stapedotomy</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0610">Otosclerosis is a localized disease of the bone derived from the embryonic otic capsule in which lamellar bone is replaced by woven bone of greater thickness and vascularity. It may develop spontaneously but is often seen in pedigrees and accelerated by pregnancy; the inherited form is associated with mutations of the <span class="italic">RELN</span> gene. The position of the focus of new bone formation determines its effect on the function of the ear. When new bone develops around the footplate of the stapes, it may fix the footplate to the margin of the fenestra vestibuli and prevent it from moving. This impedes the passage of vibrations of the tympanic membrane passing through the ossicular chain to the inner ear, producing a conductive hearing loss. Otosclerosis affecting other parts of the otic capsule is thought to cause a sensorineural element to the overall hearing loss.</div><div class="text" id="p0615">The footplate may be fixed by conditions other than otosclerosis. Rarely it may be fixed from birth, congenital fixation, but more commonly is the result of chronic otitis media causing dense scarring throughout the middle ear cleft known as tympanosclerosis, or associated with other temporal bone anomalies, e.g. Wardenberg syndrome (<a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_22">Melzer et al 2016</a>).

The tympanic membrane is temporarily elevated for access to the middle ear and, under microscopic control, the incudostapedial joint is disarticulated. The limbs of the stapes and stapedius are then both divided and the superstructure of the stapes removed. Formerly the entire footplate was removed (stapedectomy) but nowadays a small hole (stapedotomy) is then made in the fixed footplate of the stapes using a microdrill, laser or hand reamer to expose the membranous inner ear bathed in perilymph. A small graft of connective tissue is used to cover the hole with a flexible membrane.

The former arises from the inferior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve and reaches the tympanic cavity via the tympanic canaliculus for the tympanic nerve.

It sends a branch to the greater petrosal nerve via an opening anterior to the fenestra vestibuli. The lesser petrosal nerve, which may be regarded as the continuation of the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve, traverses the tympanic plexus. It occupies a small canal below that for the tensor tympani. It runs past, and receives a connecting branch from, the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. The lesser petrosal nerve emerges from the anterior surface of the temporal bone via a small opening lateral to the hiatus for the greater petrosal nerve and then traverses either the foramen ovale or the sphenopetrosal fissure or the innominate canal (of Arnold) to join the otic ganglion. Postganglionic secretomotor fibres leave this ganglion in the auriculotemporal nerve to supply the parotid gland. In former times, the operation of tympanic neurectomy was undertaken to reduce salivation in patients who drooled and to diminish facial sweating in those with Frey’s syndrome following parotidectomy; less invasive and more effective procedures are employed nowadays.</div></section><section><a id="s0500"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0410">Facial nerve</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0735">The facial nerve consists of intracranial (cisternal), intratemporal and extratemporal portions. The intratemporal portion is further <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="750" id="pagebreak_750"/><a id="pg750"/>divided into meatal, labyrinthine, tympanic (horizontal) and mastoid (vertical) segments (<a href="#f0065">Fig. 42.12</a>). The cisternal segment emerges from the ventrolateral aspect of the caudal border of the pons. The meatal segment enters the porus acusticus of the internal acoustic meatus accompanied by the nervus intermedius, the vestibulocochlear nerve and the labyrinthine vessels. In this part of its course, the nerve lacks a fibrous sheath or endoneurium and is surrounded by a thin layer of arachnoid. The motor root, which supplies the muscles of the face, and the nervus intermedius, which contains sensory fibres concerned with the perception of taste and parasympathetic (secretomotor) fibres to various glands, are still separate components; they usually merge within the meatus. The labyrinthine segment runs from the fundus of the internal acoustic meatus to the geniculate ganglion, where the nerve makes the first bend or genu (see <a href="#f0060">Fig. 42.11</a>). The labyrinthine segment is the shortest and narrowest part of the facial nerve; it lacks anastomosing arterial cascades, which renders it susceptible to vascular compression. The tympanic segment initially curves around the oval window niche, then lies just anterior and inferior to the lateral semicircular canal and bends again at the second genu to become the mastoid segment, which is the longest of the petrous segments and runs from the pyramidal process to the stylomastoid foramen. The tympanic and mastoid segments of the facial nerve are supplied by the facial arch, formed by the petrosal branch of the middle meningeal artery and the stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery. The extratemporal course of the facial nerve is described in <a href="../B9780702077050000367/B9780702077050000367.xhtml">Chapter 36</a> (<a href="../B9780702077050000367/B9780702077050000367.xhtml#pagebreak_632">pages 632</a> and <a href="../B9780702077050000367/B9780702077050000367.xhtml#pagebreak_633">633</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0065"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000422/main.assets/f42-12-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0060"/><a id="fspara0060"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 42.12</span> A schematic diagram to illustrate the relationships of the facial nerve within the temporal bone. For simplicity, the course of the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve has been portrayed more superiorly than it is in life. At the first genu, it turns sharply on itself and passes deeply to the internal auditory meatus. In an anatomically correct diagram, its course viewed from the lateral perspective (as shown here) would be obscured by the ossicular mass. The facial nerve is vulnerable to injury at several sites within the temporal bone and the neck. The labyrinthine and perigeniculate segments are susceptible to compression, ischaemia and transection in both longitudinal and transverse fractures of the temporal bone. The narrowing of the facial (Fallopian) canal at the meatal foramen has been implicated in the pathogenesis of idiopathic facial palsy (Bell’s palsy). At the first genu, the facial nerve is tethered by the greater petrosal nerve, increasing its susceptibility to iatrogenic shearing injuries when it is mobilized in re-routing procedures to enable access to tumours. The facial (Fallopian) canal containing the tympanic segment of the facial nerve may be dehiscent above and distal to the oval window; as a result, the nerve is easily and inadvertently damaged in middle ear surgery for cholesteatoma or stapedectomy. The mastoid segment of the facial nerve is lateral to the tympanic anulus where it is at risk of surgical trauma in meatoplasty surgery around the external acoustic meatus. <br/><span class="figcredit">Redrawn from Francis HW 2010 Anatomy of the temporal bone, external ear, and middle ear.

The greater petrosal nerve passes anteriorly, receives a branch from the tympanic plexus and traverses a hiatus on the anterior surface of the petrous part of the temporal bone. It enters the middle cranial fossa, runs forwards in a groove on the bone above the lesser petrosal nerve, and then passes beneath the trigeminal ganglion to reach the foramen lacerum. Here it is joined by the deep petrosal nerve from the internal carotid sympathetic plexus, to become the nerve of the pterygoid canal (Vidian nerve).

It may split into two or three strands, starting at the geniculate ganglion, and then make its way across the promontory to the stylomastoid foramen, or pass a few millimetres posteriorly to its second genu, before it turns inferiorly posterior to the fossa incudis, a position where it is particularly vulnerable during surgical exploration of the mastoid antrum. The more proximal the division into strands, the more bizarre is the subsequent course. More distal bifurcations pass either side of the fenestra vestibuli. It may be dehiscent, particularly in its second part, when it occasionally overhangs the stapes, or run inferior to the stapedial superstructure, a position that renders it vulnerable during surgery to the stapes (<a href="#bib5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_5">Barnes et al 2001</a>). The motor fibres to the face may be carried through the chorda tympani, which is then enlarged. When this is the case, the distal facial nerve dwindles to a fibrous strand in a narrowed stylomastoid foramen. In chronic bone disease in the tympanic cavity, the facial nerve may be exposed in its canal. Inflammation may lead to facial paralysis of the infranuclear or lower motor neurone type.</div></section><section><a id="s0510"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0420">Bell’s palsy</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0765">Bell’s palsy is the eponym given to an idiopathic lower motor neurone facial palsy. It may be complete or partial, and is characterized by a flaccid paralysis of the ipsilateral muscles of facial expression; decreased lacrimation in the ipsilateral eye (which is controlled by neurones in the greater petrosal nerve); and hyperacusis or decreased tolerance of loud noises in the ipsilateral ear as a result of paralysis of stapedius. Its cause remains the subject of speculation but is most probably a herpes virus infection (<a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">Zandian et al 2014</a>). Magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that there are inflammatory changes in labyrinthine and perigeniculate segments of the facial nerve.

It is continuous with that of the pharynx, via the pharyngotympanic tube, and covers the ossicles, muscles and nerves in the cavity to form the inner layer of the tympanic membrane and the outer layer of the secondary tympanic membrane. It also spreads into the mastoid antrum and air cells. The middle ear mucosa is a mucus-secreting respiratory mucosa bearing cilia on its surface. The precise distribution of the mucociliary epithelium varies in normal middle ears, being more widespread in the young. Three distinct mucociliary pathways have been identified – epitympanic, promontorial and hypotympanic – the latter being the largest. Each of these pathways coalesces at the tympanic orifice of the pharyngotympanic tube (<a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Gleeson et al 1991</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0775">The mucosa forms several vascular folds that extend from the tympanic walls to the ossicles: one descends from the roof of the cavity to the head of the malleus and the upper margin of the body of the incus, and a second surrounds the stapedius. Other folds invest the chorda tympani nerve and tensor tympani. The folds separate off saccular recesses that give the interior of the tympanic cavity a somewhat honeycombed appearance; these mucosal folds have been described in greater detail by <a href="#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">Proctor (1964)</a>. Of note, the superior recess of the tympanic membrane, Prussak’s space, lies between the neck of the malleus and the pars flaccida, bounded by the lateral malleolar fold (<a href="#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Marchioni et al 2013</a>). This space can play an important role in the retention of keratin and subsequent development of cholesteatoma.</div><section><a id="s0520"/><section><a id="s0525"/><h4 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0430">Cholesteatoma</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0780">Cholesteatoma is the name given to keratinizing squamous epithelium within the middle ear. There is debate as to how such epithelium comes to be in the middle ear. Theories include development from embryological cell rests, metaplasia from inflamed mucoperiosteum, and aberrant migration of squamous epithelium either through a perforation in the tympanic membrane (usually in the pars flaccida or posterosuperior pars tensa) or within an area of tympanic membrane atelectasis where the tympanic membrane becomes adherent to the medial wall of the tympanic cavity. It is likely that all of these processes may be implicated at some time. A feature of cholesteatoma that remains poorly understood is its ability to erode bone, by activating osteoclasts, thus allowing the epithelium to proliferate and invade, destroying the temporal bone and carrying infection to the soft tissues. Cholesteatoma can therefore cause deafness through damage to the ossicles and inner ear; problems with balance through damage to the vestibule and semicircular canals; facial palsy through ischaemia and necrosis of the facial nerve; and intracranial sepsis.
