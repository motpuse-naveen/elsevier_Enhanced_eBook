The kidneys are located between the twelfth thoracic vertebra and third lumbar vertebra in the retroperitoneum, and are surrounded by perirenal fat and renal fascia: the right kidney is slightly lower than the left. Each kidney produces urine by a process that includes glomerular filtration, selective resorption and concentration. Urine passes to the urinary bladder via the renal calyces, renal pelvis and ureter. The kidneys are supplied by the renal arteries, which are branches of the abdominal aorta. The ureters are supplied in proximo-distal sequence by branches from the abdominal aorta, renal, gonadal, common iliac and internal iliac arteries. Anatomical variations include horseshoe kidney, accessory renal arteries and duplicated ureters.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">glomerulus; kidney; renal artery; renal calyx; renal corpuscle; renal fascia; renal pelvis; renal tubule; renal vein; ureter</div></section>--><section><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Kidney</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The kidneys excrete end products of metabolism and excess water. These actions are essential for the control of concentrations of various substances in the body, maintaining electrolyte and water balance approximately constant in the tissue fluids. The kidneys also have endocrine functions, producing and releasing erythropoietin, which affects red blood cell formation; renin, which influences blood pressure; 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (the metabolically active form of vitamin D), which is involved in the control of calcium absorption and mineral metabolism; and other soluble factors with metabolic actions.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">In the fresh state the kidneys are reddish-brown. They are retroperitoneal, located on either side of the vertebral column, and are surrounded by adipose tissue. Superiorly the kidneys are level with the upper border of the twelfth thoracic vertebra on the left and the first lumbar vertebra on the right, and inferiorly, with the third or fourth lumbar vertebra on the left and the fourth lumbar vertebra on the right (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Mirjalili et al 2012</a>). The right is usually slightly inferior to the left, reflecting its relationship to the liver. The left is a little longer and narrower than the right and lies nearer the median plane (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 72.1</span></a>). The long axis of each kidney is directed inferolaterally and the transverse axis posteromedially, which means that the anterior and posterior aspects usually described are, in fact, anterolateral and posteromedial. An appreciation of this orientation is important in percutaneous and endo-urological renal surgery.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000720/main.assets/f72-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 72.1</span> Relations of the kidneys and ureters in the male retroperitoneum. <br/><span class="figcredit">Sobotta Atlas of Human Anatomy © Elsevier GmbH, Urban &amp; Fischer, Munich.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0020">In adults, each kidney is typically 11<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm in length, 6<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm in width and 3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm in anteroposterior dimension.

All Rights Reserved.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0060">The renal fascia was originally described as two separate entities, the posterior fascia of Zuckerkandl and the anterior fascia of Gerota, which fused laterally to form the lateroconal fascia (<a href="#bib5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_5">Chesbrough et al 1989</a>, <a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_3">Burkhill and Healy 2000</a>). According to this view, the lateroconal fascia continued anterolaterally behind the colon to blend with the parietal peritoneum. However, <a href="#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_21">Mitchell (1950)</a> showed that the renal fascia is a single multi-laminated structure that is fused posteromedially with the muscular fasciae of psoas major and quadratus lumborum. It then extends anterolaterally behind the kidney as a bilaminated sheet, which, at a variable point, divides into a thin anterior layer, passing anterior to the kidney, and a thicker posterior layer that continues anterolaterally as the lateroconal fascia and fuses with the parietal peritoneum.</div><div class="text" id="p0065">Classically, the anterior layer of renal fascia was thought to blend into the dense mass of connective tissue surrounding the great vessels in the root of the mesentery behind the duodenum and pancreas, thereby preventing communication between perirenal spaces across the midline. However, inspection of computed tomography (CT) images or of anatomical sections of cadavers, following injection of contrast or coloured latex, respectively, into the perirenal space, revealed that fluid could extend across the midline at the third to fifth lumbar levels through a narrow channel measuring 2–10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm in the anteroposterior dimension. In the midline superiorly, the anterior and posterior layers of renal fascia fuse and are attached to the crura of the respiratory diaphragm. Inferiorly, the fasciae are separate for a variable craniocaudal distance. The posterior layer of renal fascia fuses with the psoas fascia, while the anterior layer of renal fascia extends across the midline anterior to the aorta and inferior vena cava; communication between the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1261" id="pagebreak_1261"/><a id="pg1261"/>two sides is permitted, although it is very rarely of clinical significance. Below this level, the two fasciae once again merge and are attached to the aorta and inferior vena cava or iliac vessels. The containment of fluid to one side of the perirenal space that is observed in over two-thirds of clinical cases is attributed to the presence of fibrous septa.</div><div class="text" id="p0070">Above the suprarenal glands, the anterior and posterior layers of renal fascia were previously said to fuse with each other and to the diaphragmatic fascia. This description of a closed superior cone is not universally accepted. Cadaveric dissections have shown that the superior aspect of the perirenal space is open and in continuity with the bare area of the liver on the right and the subphrenic space on the left. The posterior fascial layer blends bilaterally with the psoas fascia and fascia over quadratus lumborum, and with the diaphragmatic fascia. The anterior fascial layer on the right blends with the inferior aspect of the right coronary ligament at the level of the upper pole of the kidney and the bare area of the liver. On the left, the anterior layer fuses with the gastrosplenic ligament at the level of the suprarenal gland.</div><div class="text" id="p0075">There is some debate concerning the inferior fusion of the renal fascia. Many investigators believe that, inferiorly, the anterior and posterior layers of the renal fascia fuse to produce an inverted cone that is open to the pelvis at its apex. Laterally, the anterior and posterior layers fuse with the iliac fascia; medially, they fuse with the periureteric connective tissue. The apex of the cone is open anatomically towards the iliac fossa but rapidly becomes sealed in inflammatory disease. An alternative view based on dissections of recently deceased cadavers after injections of coloured latex into the perirenal space, has shown that the anterior and posterior layers of renal fascia merge to form a single multilaminar fascia that contains the ureter in the iliac fossa. Anteriorly, this common fascia is loosely connected to the parietal peritoneum, and so denies free communication between the perirenal space and the pelvis, and between the perirenal and pararenal spaces.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">A simple nephrectomy for benign disease removes the kidney from within the renal fascia; a radical nephrectomy (for cancer) classically removes the entire contents of the perirenal space, including the renal fascia and suprarenal gland, in order to give adequate clearance around the tumour.</div></section><section><a id="s0055"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0040">Relations</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0085">The superior poles of both kidneys are thick and round and related to their respective suprarenal glands.

The rays taper towards the renal capsule and are peripheral prolongations from the bases of renal pyramids. The cortex is histologically divisible into outer and inner zones. The inner zone is demarcated from the renal medulla by tangential blood vessels (arcuate arteries and veins), which lie at the junction of the two; however, a thin layer of cortical tissue (subcortex) appears on the medullary side of this zone.

Dissection into this plane can be challenging but is important in surgery on the renal pelvis, particularly open stone surgery. Within the renal sinus the collecting tubules of the nephrons of the kidney open on to the summits of the renal papillae to drain into minor calyces, which are funnel-shaped expansions of the upper urinary tract. The renal capsule covers the external surface of the kidney and continues through the hilum to line the renal sinus and fuse with the adventitial coverings of the minor calyces. Each minor calyx surrounds either a single renal papilla or, more rarely, groups of two or three renal papillae. The minor calyces unite with their neighbours to form two, or possibly three, larger chambers: the major calyces. There is wide variation in the arrangement of the calyces. As the posterior aspect of the kidney rotates laterally during its ascent <span class="italic">in utero</span>, the calyces that were lateral <span class="italic">in utero</span> become positioned anteriorly and the medial calyces move more posteriorly. The major calyces drain into the infundibula (<a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">MacLennan 2012</a>). The renal pelvis is normally formed from the junction of two infundibula – one from the upper and one from the lower pole greater calyces – but there may be a third, which drains the calyces in the mid portion of the kidney. The major calyces are usually grouped so that three pairs drain into the upper pole infundibulum and four pairs into the lower one. If there is a middle infundibulum, the distribution is normally three pairs at the upper pole, two in the middle, and two at the lower pole. There is considerable variation in the arrangement of the infundibula and in the extent to which the renal pelvis is intrarenal or extrarenal. The funnel-shaped renal pelvis tapers as it passes inferomedially, traversing the hilum to become continuous with the ureter (see <a href="#f0115">Figs 72.8</a>–<a href="#f0125">72.9</a>
). It is rarely possible to determine precisely where the renal pelvis ceases and the ureter begins; the region is usually extrahilar and normally lies adjacent to the lower part of the medial border of the kidney. Rarely, the entire renal pelvis has been found to lie inside the renal sinus so that the junction between it and the ureter occurs either in the vicinity of the hilum or completely within the renal sinus.</div><div id="p0150"/><div class="text" id="p0155">The calyces, renal pelvis and ureter are well demonstrated radiologically following an intravenous injection of radio-opaque contrast that is excreted in the urine (computed tomographic urography, CTU) (<a href="#f0125"><span class="bold">Fig. 72.9</span></a>), or after the introduction of radio-opaque contrast into the ureter by catheterization through a cystoscope (ascending or retrograde pyelography). Normal cupping of the minor calyces by projecting renal papillae can be obliterated by conditions that cause hydronephrosis, e.g. chronic distension of the ureter and renal pelvis due to upper or lower urinary tract obstruction, resulting in elevated pressure of the renal pelvis. An appreciation of the rotation of the kidneys, which results when the posterior calyces lie relatively medially and the anterior calyces lie laterally, is essential for interpreting contrast imaging of the collecting system of the kidneys.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1264" id="pagebreak_1264"/><a id="pg1264"/></div><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0125"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000720/main.assets/on72-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0125"/><a id="fspara0135"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 72.9</span> A volume-rendered coronal CT urogram of a 39-year-old male; collecting systems, ureters and bladder are normal.</figcaption></figure></div></div></section></section><section><a id="s0070"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0055">Vascular supply and lymphatic drainage</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0060">Renal arteries</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0075"/><div class="textfl" id="p0160">The paired renal arteries take about 20% of the cardiac output to supply organs that represent less than 1% of total body weight.

In its extrarenal course, each renal artery gives off one or more inferior suprarenal arteries, ureteric and capsular branches, and branches that supply perirenal tissue and the renal pelvis. Near the hilum of the kidney, each artery divides into an anterior and a posterior branch, and these divide into segmental arteries supplying the renal vascular segments.

Five arterial segments of the kidney have been identified (<a href="#f0055"><span class="bold">Fig. 72.14A</span></a>). The superior segment occupies the anteromedial region of the superior pole. The anterior superior segment includes the rest of the superior pole and the central anterosuperior region. The inferior segment encompasses the whole inferior pole. The anterior inferior segment lies between the anterior and inferior segments. The posterior segment includes the whole posterior region between the superior and inferior segments. This is the pattern most commonly seen, and although there can be considerable variation, it is the pattern that clinicians most frequently encounter when performing partial nephrectomy. Anatomical and radiological analyses have suggested that there could be up to nine arterial segments for each kidney (<a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Macchi et al 2019</a>) (<a href="#f0055"><span class="bold">Fig. 72.14B</span></a>).

Knowledge of the vascular anatomy of the kidney is important when partial nephrectomy is undertaken for renal cell carcinoma. In this surgery, the branches of the renal artery are defined so that the surgeon can safely excise the tumour while not compromising the vascular supply to the remaining renal tissue (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Novick 1998</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0085"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0070">Lobar, interlobar, arcuate and interlobular arteries</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0190">The initial branches of segmental arteries are lobar, usually one to each renal pyramid. Before reaching the renal pyramid they subdivide into two or three interlobar arteries, extending towards the cortex around each pyramid. At the junction of the renal cortex and medulla, interlobar arteries dichotomize into arcuate arteries, which diverge at right angles. As they arch between the renal cortex and medulla, each divides further, ultimately supplying interlobular arteries that diverge radially into the cortex. The terminations of adjacent arcuate arteries do not anastomose but end in the renal cortex as additional interlobular arteries. Though most interlobular arteries come from arcuate branches, some arise directly from arcuate, or even terminal, interlobar arteries (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 72.13</a>). Interlobular arteries ascend towards the superficial cortex or can branch occasionally en route. Some are more tortuous and recurve towards the renal medulla at least once before proceeding towards the renal surface. Others traverse the surface as perforating arteries to anastomose with the capsular plexus (which is also supplied from the inferior suprarenal, renal and gonadal arteries).</div><section><a id="s0090"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0075">Afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0195">Afferent glomerular arterioles are mainly the lateral rami of interlobular arteries. A few arise from arcuate and interlobar arteries when they vary their direction and angle of origin: deeper ones incline obliquely back towards the renal medulla, the intermediate pass horizontally and the more superficial approach the surface of the kidney obliquely before ending in a glomerulus (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 72.13</a>). Efferent glomerular arterioles from most glomeruli (except at juxtamedullary and, sometimes, intermediate cortical levels) soon divide to form a dense peritubular capillary plexus around the proximal and distal convoluted tubules; there are therefore two sets of capillaries – glomerular and peritubular – in series in the main renal cortical circulation, linked by efferent glomerular arterioles. The vascular supply of the renal medulla is largely from efferent arterioles of juxtamedullary glomeruli, supplemented by some from more superficial glomeruli, and ‘aglomerular’ arterioles (probably from degenerated glomeruli). Efferent glomerular arterioles passing into the renal medulla are relatively long, wide vessels, and contribute side branches to neighbouring capillary plexuses before entering the renal medulla, where each divides into 12–25 descending vasa recta. As their name suggests, these run straight to various depths in the renal medulla, contributing side branches to a radially elongated capillary plexus applied to the descending and ascending limbs of renal loops and to collecting ducts. The venous ends of capillaries converge to the ascending vasa recta, which drain into arcuate or interlobular veins. An essential feature of the vasa recta (particularly in the outer medulla) is <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1265" id="pagebreak_1265"/><a id="pg1265"/>that both descending and ascending vessels are grouped into vascular bundles, within which the external aspects of both types are closely apposed, bringing them close to the limbs of the nephron loops (of Henle) and collecting ducts. As these bundles converge centrally into the renal medulla, they contain fewer vessels; some terminate at successive levels in neighbouring capillary plexuses. This proximity of descending and ascending vessels to each other and to adjacent collecting ducts provides the structural basis for the countercurrent exchange and multiplier phenomena (<a href="#f0060"><span class="bold">Fig. 72.15</span></a>). These complex renal vascular patterns show regional specializations that are closely adapted to the spatial organization and functions of renal corpuscles, tubules and ducts (see below).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0060"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000720/main.assets/f72-12-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0060"/><a id="fspara0060"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 72.15</span> The regional microstructure and principal activities of a nephron and collecting duct.

Many interlobular veins begin beneath the fibrous capsule of the kidney by the convergence of several stellate veins, which drain the most superficial zone of the renal cortex and so are named from their surface appearance. Interlobular veins pass to the corticomedullary junction and also receive some ascending vasa recta before ending in arcuate veins (which accompany arcuate arteries), and anastomose with neighbouring veins. Arcuate veins drain into interlobar veins, which anastomose and form the renal vein.</div><div class="text" id="p0205">The large renal veins lie anterior to the renal arteries and open into the inferior vena cava almost at right-angles (see <a href="../B9780702077050000598/B9780702077050000598.xhtml#f0030">Fig. 59.6</a>; <a href="#f0065"><span class="bold">Fig. 72.16</span></a>).

However, the left renal vein can also be double, one vein passing posterior and the other anterior to the aorta before draining into the inferior vena cava, an arrangement that is sometimes referred to as persistence of the ‘renal collar’. The anterior vein can be absent, in which case <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1266" id="pagebreak_1266"/><a id="pg1266"/>there is a single retro-aortic left renal vein.

The shape of the cells depends on tubular fluid pressure, which, in life, distends the lumen and flattens the cells (they become taller when glomerular blood pressure ceases post mortem or at biopsy). The cytoplasm of proximal tubular cells is strongly eosinophilic and the nuclei are euchromatic and central. The basal cytoplasm is rich in mitochondria, orientated perpendicularly and the basal plasma membrane is highly infolded. The lateral surfaces of adjacent epithelial cells interdigitate, increasing the complexity of the basolateral plasma membrane. The microvilli on the luminal surfaces significantly increase the area of plasma membrane in contact with tubular fluid, facilitating the transport of ions and small molecules against steep concentration gradients. The abundant mitochondria supply the energy, as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), needed for this process. Sodium/potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase) is located in apical and basal membranes, and the cytoplasm contains numerous other enzymes concerned with ion transport. Water and other solutes pass between cells (paracellular transport) passively, along osmotic and electrochemical gradients, probably through leaky apical tight junctions. Pinocytotic vesicles are found near the apical surface and represent the means by which small proteins and peptides from the filtrate are internalized and degraded by associated lysosomes.

The thick segment is composed of cuboidal epithelium with many mitochondria, deep basolateral folds and short apical microvilli, indicating a more active metabolic role.

At the junction of the straight and convoluted regions, the distal tubule comes close to the vascular pole of its parent renal corpuscle. Here, tubular cells form the macula densa, a sensory structure that is concerned with the regulation of blood flow and therefore the filtration rate. Cells in the terminal part of the distal tubule have fewer basal folds and mitochondria and constitute a connecting duct formed from metanephric mesenchyme during embryogenesis. Collecting ducts are lined by simple cuboidal or columnar epithelium. This increases in height from the renal cortex, where the ducts receive the contents of distal tubules, to the wide papillary ducts that discharge at the cribriform area (area cribrosa). The pale-staining principal cells have relatively few organelles or lateral interdigitations, and only occasional microvilli.

Three structures separate the two: the capillary endothelium, the glomerular basal lamina and the foot process of the podocyte. Of these, the principal structure is the glomerular basal lamina (<a href="#f0075">Fig. 72.18B</a>). This gradient far exceeds the colloid osmotic pressure of blood, which opposes the outward flow of filtrate. In the peripheral renal cortex, the arteriolar pressure gradient is enhanced because afferent glomerular arterioles are wider than efferent ones. In all glomeruli, the rate of filtration can be altered by changes in the tone of the glomerular arterioles.

Measurements of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are based on the renal clearance of a marker in plasma, expressed as the volume of plasma completely cleared of the marker per unit time. Markers used to measure GFR can be endogenous (creatinine, urea) or exogenous (inulin, iothalamate). The ideal marker is endogenous, freely filtered by the glomerulus, neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the renal tubule, and eliminated only by the kidney.</div></section><section><a id="s0165"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0150">Selective resorption</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0345">Selective resorption from the filtrate is an active process and occurs mainly in the proximal convoluted tubules, which resorb glucose, amino acids, phosphate, chloride, sodium, calcium and bicarbonate, and take up small proteins (e.g. albumin) by endocytosis. Cells of the proximal tubules are permeable to water, which passes out of the tubules passively, so that the filtrate remains locally isotonic with blood. The rest of the tubule reabsorbs most of the water (to a variable extent up to 95%), so that urine is generally much reduced in volume and hypertonic to blood when it reaches the calyces. The process depends on establishing high osmolality in the medullary interstitium in order to exert sufficient osmotic pressure on water-permeable regions of the tubule, and is achieved by a countercurrent multiplier mechanism.</div><section><a id="s0170"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0155">Countercurrent multiplier mechanism</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0350">The countercurrent multiplier mechanism is responsible for producing a high osmolality in the extratubular interstitial tissue of the renal medulla. Water passes freely from the tubular lumen into the adjacent medullary interstitium along the descending limb of the nephron loop. This part of the tubule is less permeable to solutes. In the thick ascending limb, sodium and chloride ions are actively transported from the tubule lumen into interstitial spaces, while the tubular epithelium remains impermeable to water. The increased interstitial osmolality causes water to be withdrawn from the descending part of the nephron loop, thus concentrating the filtrate. Tubular fluid flows in a countercurrent on its descent into and ascent out of the renal medulla; it is augmented by new isotonic fluid entering the nephron loop, and depleted by hypotonic fluid leaving the loop as solutes are actively resorbed. The osmotic gradient within the interstitium is therefore multiplied from the corticomedullary boundary to the renal pyramids, where it reaches equilibrium at four to five times the osmolality of plasma. Although the tonicity of the tubular fluid changes during its passage through the steep osmotic gradient within the renal medulla, the osmotic gradient between ascending and descending limbs at each level never exceeds 200<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mOsm/kg, a force that can be sustained by the cells of the tubular wall.</div></section><section><a id="s0175"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0160">Countercurrent exchange mechanism</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0355">Rapid removal of ions from the renal medulla by the circulation of blood is minimized by another looped countercurrent system. This is the countercurrent exchange mechanism, in which arterioles entering the renal medulla pass for long distances parallel to the venules leaving it, before ending in capillary beds around tubules. This close apposition of oppositely flowing blood allows ions to diffuse directly from outflowing to inflowing blood, so that the vasa recta (see <a href="#f0050">Fig. 72.13</a>) conserve the high osmotic pressure in the renal medulla.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0180"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0165">Concentration of urine</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0360">Because sodium and chloride ions are selectively resorbed by the cells of the ascending limbs and distal tubules under aldosterone control, the filtrate at the distal end of the convoluted tubules is hypotonic. As it reaches the collecting ducts, fluid descends again through the renal medulla and thus re-enters a region of high osmotic pressure. The cells lining the collecting ducts are variably permeable to water, under the influence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Water follows an osmotic gradient into the adjacent extratubular spaces, so that the tonicity of the filtrate gradually rises along collecting ducts, until, at the tip of the renal pyramids, it is above that of blood. This complex system is highly flexible and the balance between the rates of filtration and absorption can be varied to meet current physiological demands.</div><div class="text" id="p0365">Control of hydrogen and ammonium ion concentrations is essential for the regulation of acids and bases in the blood.

Macula densa cells are thought to respond to high salt concentration in the distal tubule by releasing nitric oxide, which inhibits the tubuloglomerular feedback response and reduces filtration rate. The role of macula densa cells in the stimulation of renin release to increase the filtration rate is less well understood.</div><div class="text" id="p0380">The third element of the juxtaglomerular apparatus is a population of extraglomerular mesangial cells that form a network of stellate cells connecting the macula densa sensory cells with the juxtaglomerular <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1273" id="pagebreak_1273"/><a id="pg1273"/>effector cells.

The abdominal part travels from the renal pelvis to the linea terminalis and descends posterior to the peritoneum on the medial part of psoas major, which separates it from the tips of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. During surgery on intraperitoneal structures, the ureter can be tented up as the peritoneum is drawn anteriorly, resulting in iatrogenic injury. Anterior to psoas major, it crosses anterior to the genitofemoral nerve and is obliquely crossed by the gonadal vessels. It enters the lesser pelvis either anterior to the end of the common iliac vessels or at the origin of the external iliac vessels.</div><div class="text" id="p0395">The right ureter is usually overlapped by the descending part of the duodenum at its origin. It descends lateral to the inferior vena cava and is crossed anteriorly by the right colic and ileocolic vessels. Near the superior aperture of the lesser pelvis it passes behind the lower part of the mesentery and the terminal ileum. The left ureter is lateral to the abdominal aorta and is crossed by the gonadal and left colic vessels. It passes posterior to the jejunum and sigmoid colon and its mesentery in the posterior wall of the intersigmoid recess. The inferior mesenteric vein has a long retroperitoneal course lying close to the medial aspect of the left ureter.</div><div class="text" id="p0400">The pelvic part of the ureter extends from the linea terminalis to the point where it pierces the wall of the urinary bladder. At first, the ureter descends posterolaterally on the lateral wall of the lesser pelvis along the anterior border of the greater sciatic foramen, lying in extraperitoneal areolar tissue. Opposite the ischial spine, it turns anteromedially into fibrous adipose tissue above levator ani to reach the fundus of the bladder. On the pelvic side wall the ureter is anterior to the internal iliac artery and the origin of its anterior division; the internal iliac vein, lumbosacral trunk and sacroiliac joint are posterior relations. Laterally, it lies on the obturator fascia and progressively crosses to become medial to the umbilical, inferior vesical and middle anorectal arteries.</div><div class="text" id="p0405">In males, the pelvic part of the ureter hooks under the ductus deferens (<a href="#f0090"><span class="bold">Fig. 72.21</span></a>); it then passes anterior and slightly superior to the upper pole of the seminal gland to the wall of the urinary bladder. In females, the pelvic part of the ureter initially has the same relations as in males, but anterior to the internal iliac artery it is immediately behind the ovary, forming the posterior boundary of the ovarian fossa (see <a href="../B9780702077050000756/B9780702077050000756.xhtml#f0045">Fig. 75.8</a>). In the anteromedial part of its course to the urinary bladder it is related to the uterine artery, uterine cervix and vaginal fornix. It lies in extraperitoneal connective tissue in the inferomedial part of the broad ligament of the uterus and can be injured during hysterectomy (see <a href="../B9780702077050000756/B9780702077050000756.xhtml#f0040">Fig. 75.7</a>). In the broad ligament of the uterus, the uterine artery is anterosuperior to the ureter for approximately 2.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm and then crosses to its medial side to ascend alongside the uterus.

It then inclines medially to reach the urinary bladder, with a variable relation to the anterior aspect of the vagina.

The ureteric nerves consist of relatively large bundles of axons that form an irregular plexus in the adventitia of the ureter. The ureteric plexus receives branches from the renal and aortic plexuses (in its upper part); from the superior hypogastric plexus and hypogastric nerve (in its intermediate part); and from the hypogastric nerve and inferior hypogastric plexus (in its lower part). Numerous small branches penetrate the ureteric muscle coat; some of the adventitial nerves accompany the blood vessels and branch with them as they extend into the muscle layer; others are unrelated to the vascular supply and lie free in the adventitial connective tissue around the circumference of the ureter.</div><div class="text" id="p0435">The density of innervation increases gradually from the renal pelvis and proximal (upper) ureter (where autonomic nerves are sparse) to a maximum density in the juxtavesical segment. At least three different neurotransmitter phenotypes – cholinergic, noradrenergic and peptidergic (substance P) – are well known and others have been reported. The functional significance of these different types of autonomic nerve fibres in relation to ureteric smooth muscle activity is not fully understood; although they are thought to influence the inherent motility of the ureter, they are not essential for the initiation and propagation of ureteric contraction waves. A branching plexus of fine cholinergic, noradrenergic and peptidergic axons occurs throughout the lamina propria and extends from the inner aspect of the muscle coat towards the base of the urothelium. Some of these axons form perivascular plexuses, while others lie in isolation from the vascular supply and could be sensory in function.</div><section><a id="s0225"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0210">Ureteric peristalsis</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0440">Under normal conditions, contraction waves originate in the proximal part of the upper urinary tract and are propagated anterogradely towards the urinary bladder. Atypical smooth muscle cells in the wall of the minor calyces act individually or collectively as pacemaker sites. A peristaltic wave begins at one (or possibly more) of these sites. Once initiated, the contraction is propagated through the wall of the adjacent major calyx and activates the smooth muscle of the renal pelvis. Contraction waves are propagated away from the kidney, and so undesirable pressure rises are not directed against the renal parenchyma. Since there are several potential pacemaker sites, the initiation of contraction waves is unimpaired by partial nephrectomy; the minor calyces spared by the resection remain <span class="italic">in situ</span> to continue their pacemaking function. Pressures within the ureter at the time of peristalsis reach 20–80<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm H<sub>2</sub>O.</div><div class="text" id="p0445">Experimental evidence indicates that autonomic nerves do not play a major part in the propagation of peristalsis. It seems more likely that they modulate the contractile events occurring in the musculature of the upper urinary tract. The most likely mechanism to account for impulse propagation is myogenic conduction mediated by the electrotonic coupling of one muscle cell to its immediate neighbours via intercellular gap junctions; there are numerous regions of close approach between ureteric smooth muscle cells and also between both types of muscle cell in the renal pelvis and calyces.</div><section><a id="s0230"/><section><a id="s0235"/><section><a id="s0240"/><section><a id="s0245"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0215">Referred pain</p><div class="textfl" id="p0450">Excessive distension of the ureter or spasm of its muscle can be caused by a stone (calculus) and provokes severe pain (ureteric colic, which is commonly, but mistakenly, called renal colic).

It is referred to cutaneous areas innervated from spinal segments that supply the ureter, mainly T11–L2, and shoots superomedially down to the scrotum or labium majus; it can extend into the proximal anterior aspect of the thigh by projection to the genitofemoral nerve (L1, L2).

Stones in the lower pole of the kidney clear less well if the angle between the infundibulum of the major calyx containing the stone and the ureter is acute, or if there is a particularly long and narrow infundibulum. Percutaneous stone extraction is most frequently achieved by puncturing a posterior calyx with a needle. Ureteric calculi tend to be arrested in their descent in either the ureteropelvic region, or at the point where the ureter passes over the linea terminalis as it crosses the common iliac artery, or at the ureterovesical junction, because these are the three areas where the ureter is narrowest. The ureterovesical junction is the narrowest of these areas and can be responsible for arresting the passage of stones of as little as 2–3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm.

The muscle bundles that constitute this coat are frequently separated from one another by relatively large amounts of connective tissue. However, branches that interconnect muscle bundles are common and there is frequent interchange of muscle fibres between adjacent bundles.

Moreover, unlike the gut, the muscle bundles <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1275" id="pagebreak_1275"/><a id="pg1275"/>are so arranged that morphologically distinct longitudinal and circular layers cannot be clearly distinguished. In the upper part of the ureter, the inner muscle bundles tend to lie longitudinally while those on the outer aspect have a circular or oblique orientation.
