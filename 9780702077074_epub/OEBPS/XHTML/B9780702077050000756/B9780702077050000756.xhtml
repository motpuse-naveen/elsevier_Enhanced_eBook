Before puberty, it is relatively flat and hairless, and the labia minora are poorly formed. Through adolescence and into adult life the mons pubis becomes prominent and develops coarse hair. It atrophies slightly after menopause.</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0035">Labia majora</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0025">The labia majora are two prominent, longitudinal folds of skin that extend back from the mons pubis to the perineum (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 75.1B</a>). They form the lateral boundaries of the vulva. Each labium has an external pigmented surface covered with hairs and a smooth pink internal surface with large sebaceous follicles. Between these surfaces there is loose connective and adipose tissue intermixed with smooth muscle (resembling the dartos muscle of the scrotum), vessels, nerves and glands. The subcutaneous layer consists of a superficial fatty layer similar to the superficial fatty layer (Camper’s fascia) of the anterior abdominal wall, and a deep membranous layer (Colles’ fascia) continuous with the deep membranous layer (Scarpa’s fascia) of the anterior abdominal wall. The round ligament of the uterus may end in the adipose tissue and skin in the anterior part of the labium majus. A patent processus vaginalis may also reach a labium majus. The labia majora join anteriorly to form the anterior commissure below the mons pubis. Posteriorly they do not join but instead merge into neighbouring skin, ending near and almost parallel to each other. The connecting skin between them posteriorly forms a ridge, the posterior commissure, which overlies the perineal body and is the posterior limit of the vulva.</div></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0040">Labia minora</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0030">The labia minora are two small cutaneous folds, devoid of fat and hair, that lie between the labia majora. They extend from the clitoris obliquely down, laterally and back, flanking the vaginal orifice. Anteriorly, each labium minus bifurcates. The upper layer of each side passes above the clitoris to form the prepuce, while the lower layer passes below the clitoris to form the frenulum of the clitoris (<a href="#f0010">Fig. 75.1A–C</a>). There are numerous sebaceous follicles on the medial surfaces. Sometimes, an extra labial fold (labium tertium) is found on one or both sides between the labia minora and majora. Adhesions between the labia minora are common in prepubertal girls; in postmenopausal females with severe atrophy they can predispose to urinary infections (<a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_31">Leung and Robson 1992</a>, <a href="#bib21" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_21">Gandhi et al 2016</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0045">Vestibule of the vagina</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0035">The vestibule of the vagina is the cavity between the labia minora.

It contains two corpora cavernosa, composed of erectile tissue and enclosed in dense fibrous tissue, and separated medially by an incomplete fibrous pectiniform septum (septum of the corpora cavernosa). The fibrous tissue forms a suspensory ligament that is attached superiorly to the pubic symphysis. Each corpus cavernosum is attached to its ischiopubic ramus by a crus that extends from the root of the clitoris. The glans clitoris is a small, round tubercle of spongy erectile tissue at the end of the body, connected to the bulbs of the vestibule by thin bands of erectile tissue (pars intermedia). It is exposed between the anterior ends of the labia minora. Its epithelium has high cutaneous sensitivity, important in sexual responses.

It forms an angle of over 90° to the uterine axis (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 75.12</a>); this angle varies with the contents of the urinary bladder and rectum. The proximal vagina is directed posteriorly towards the ischial spines. The width of the vagina increases as it ascends. The inner surfaces of the anterior and posterior vaginal walls are in contact with each other, forming a transverse slit. The vaginal mucosa is attached to the cervix of the uterus higher on the posterior cervical wall than on the anterior; the anterior wall is approximately 7.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm long and the posterior wall is approximately 9<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm long. The fibromuscular anterior wall of the vagina supports the fundus of the urinary bladder in its middle and upper portions, and the urethra (which is embedded in it) inferiorly. The fibromuscular posterior wall of the vagina supports the rectum. The upper quarter of the posterior vagina is separated from the rectum by the peritoneum of the recto-uterine pouch (pouch of Douglas), and by moderately dense fibromuscular tissue in its middle half (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Delancey 2011</a>). In its lower quarter, it is separated from the anal canal by the fibromuscular perineal body. The proximal vagina is supported laterally by levator ani, together with such ligaments as the cardinal and uterosacral. Pubovaginalis provides a U-shaped muscular sling around the mid-vagina. The distal vagina is surrounded by bulbospongiosus (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 75.4</a>). As the ureters pass anteromedially to reach the fundus of the urinary bladder they pass close to the lateral parts of the fornix, where care must be taken to avoid injury during hysterectomy (<a href="#f0040"><span class="bold">Fig. 75.7</span></a>). As they enter the urinary bladder, the ureters are usually anterior to the vagina; at this point, each ureter is crossed transversely by a uterine artery (<a href="#f0045"><span class="bold">Fig. 75.8</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0040"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000756/main.assets/f75-07-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0040"/><a id="fspara0040"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 75.7</span> The most common sites of ureteric injury during hysterectomy.

The size of the vaginal orifice varies; it is capable of great distension during childbirth and, to a lesser degree, during sexual intercourse. The hymen is a thin fold of mucous membrane situated just within the vaginal orifice. The internal surfaces of the folds are normally in contact with each other and the vaginal orifice appears as a cleft between them. The hymen varies greatly in shape and dimensions. When stretched, it is anular and widest posteriorly; it can also be semilunar and concave towards the mons pubis, cribriform, fringed, absent or complete and imperforate. The hymenal ring normally ruptures after first sexual intercourse, but can rupture earlier during non-sexual physical activity. Small round carunculae hymenales are its remnants after it has been ruptured. It has no established function.</div><div class="text" id="p0110">Remnants of the caudal end of the mesonephric duct (Gartner’s duct) (see <a href="../B9780702077050000227/B9780702077050000227.xhtml#f0065">Figs 22.13</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000227/B9780702077050000227.xhtml#f0095">22.19</a>) are occasionally seen protruding through the lateral parts of the fornix or lateral parts of the vagina and can cause cysts (Gartner’s cysts).

This produces a highly acidic (pH 3) environment that inhibits the growth of most other micro-organisms. There is less glycogen before puberty and after the menopause, when vaginal infections are more common. There are no mucous glands, but a fluid transudate from the lamina propria, supplemented by mucus production from the cervical glands (<a href="#f0050"><span class="bold">Fig. 75.9</span></a>). The muscular layers are composed of smooth muscle and consist of a thick outer longitudinal and an inner circular layer; the two layers are not distinct but are connected by oblique interlacing fibres.

In the adult nulliparous state, the cervix usually tilts forwards relative to the axis of the vagina (anteversion), and the body of the uterus tilts forwards relative to the cervix (anteflexion) (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 75.12</a>). In 10–15% of females the whole uterus leans posteriorly at an angle to the vagina and is said to be retroverted. A uterus that angles posteriorly on its cervix is described as retroflexed.</div><section><a id="s0135"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0145">Body</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0165">The body of the uterus is pear-shaped and extends from the fundus superiorly to the isthmus inferiorly. The uterine tubes enter the uterus on both sides at the utero-tubal junction: the round ligament of the uterus and proper ovarian ligament are inferoanterior and inferoposterior, respectively, to each junction. The dome-like fundus is superior <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1313" id="pagebreak_1313"/><a id="pg1313"/>to the entry points of the uterine tubes and is covered by peritoneum continuous with that of neighbouring surfaces. The fundus of the uterus is in contact with the small intestine and, occasionally, with a distended sigmoid colon. The lateral margins of the body of the uterus are convex; on each side, their peritoneum is reflected laterally to form the broad ligament, which extends as a flat sheet to the pelvic wall (see <a href="#f0060">Figs 75.11B</a>, <a href="#f0085">75.16</a>). The anterior surface of the body of the uterus is covered by peritoneum reflected on to the urinary bladder at the vesico-uterine fold (see <a href="#f0075">Fig. 75.14</a>). This normally occurs at the level of the anatomical internal os, the most inferior margin of the body of the uterus. The vesico-uterine pouch, between the urinary bladder and uterus, is obliterated when the bladder is distended, but may be occupied by small intestine when the bladder is empty. The posterior surface of the uterus is convex transversely. Its peritoneal covering continues down to the cervix and proximal vagina and is then reflected back to the rectum along the surface of the recto-uterine pouch, which lies posterior to the uterus (see <a href="#f0080">Fig. 75.15</a>). The sigmoid colon and occasionally the terminal ileum lie posterior to the uterus.</div><div class="text" id="p0170">The uterine cavity usually measures 6<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm from the external os of the uterus to the wall of the fundus and is flat in its anteroposterior plane (<a href="#bib38" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_38">Salardi et al 1985</a>). In coronal section, it is triangular, broad above where the two uterine tubes join the uterus, and narrow below at the anatomical internal os of the uterus.

Although unaffected in the first month of pregnancy, it is gradually taken up into the body of the uterus during the second month to form the ‘lower uterine segment’ (see below). In non-pregnant females the isthmus undergoes menstrual changes, although these are less pronounced than those occurring in the body of the uterus. The distal end of the cervix enters the proximal end of the vagina, thereby dividing the cervix into supravaginal and vaginal parts.

However, the left and right arterial trees anastomose across the midline and unilateral ligation can be performed without serious effects. Terminal branches in the uterine muscle are tortuous and are called helicine arterioles. They provide a series of dense capillary plexuses in the myometrium and endometrium. From the arcuate arteries, many helical arteriolar rami pass into the endometrium. Their detailed appearance changes during the menstrual cycle.

After puberty, the structure of the endometrium varies with the stage of the menstrual cycle (see below).

The submucosal (innermost) layer is composed of longitudinal and some oblique smooth muscle fibres. The vascular layer is external to the submucosal layer and is rich in blood vessels and longitudinal muscle.

At the junction between the body and the cervix, the smooth muscle merges with dense, irregular connective tissue containing both collagen and elastin and forms most of the wall of the cervix.

Branched tubular glands present within the mucosa are lined by a similar secretory epithelium. These glands extend obliquely upwards and outwards from the canal.

At the vaginal end of the cervix, the aperture of a gland may be blocked and it then fills with mucus to form a Nabothian follicle (or cyst). None of the mucosa is shed during menstruation, so unlike the body of the uterus it is not divided into functional and basal layers and lacks spiral arteries.

The lutein cells undergo fatty degeneration, autolysis, removal by macrophages and gradual replacement with fibrous tissue. Eventually, after 2 months, a small, whitish, scar-like corpus albicans is all that remains.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0175"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000756/main.assets/f75-34-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0175"/><a id="fspara0175"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 75.35</span> A low-power view of a section of a human ovary, containing a corpus luteum (C). <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Mr Peter Helliwell and the late Dr Joseph Mathew, Department of Histopathology, Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, UK.</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0480">If fertilization does occur, implantation of the blastocyst into the uterine endometrium usually begins 7 days later and the embryonic trophoblast then starts to produce hCG.

The uterus, ovaries and vagina undergo changes during the menstrual cycle, which normally lasts approximately 28 days. Usually, a single mature follicle ruptures mid-cycle (approximately day 14 of a 28-day cycle) to release a secondary oocyte. The wall of the follicle is then transformed into the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone (luteal phase). About 10 days after ovulation the corpus luteum begins to regress, then it ceases to function and is replaced by fibrous tissue. The breakdown of the endometrium that follows this cessation of function is due to the falling levels of progesterone and oestrogen as the corpus luteum degenerates.</div><div class="text" id="p0500">The changes that occur in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle can be divided into three phases: proliferative, secretory and menstrual (<a href="#f0180"><span class="bold">Fig. 75.36</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0180"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000756/main.assets/f75-35-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0180"/><a id="fspara0180"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 75.36</span> Stages in the menstrual cycle with concomitant changes in the endometrium.

Re-epithelialization is complete 5–6 days <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1325" id="pagebreak_1325"/><a id="pg1325"/>after the start of menstruation.

The glands are straight and narrow and their lining cells are low columnar. The apical cell surface contains microvilli; some cells are ciliated. The stroma is dense and contains small numbers of lymphocytes. During days 10–12 of the proliferative phase, the endometrium thickens. Cells divide in response to rising levels of oestrogen, which is produced by the ovary and acts through receptors present on both the stromal and the epithelial cells. The glands become tortuous and their lining epithelial cells become tall columnar in nature (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Fritz and Speroff 2011</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0430"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0415">Secretory phase</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0510">The secretory phase coincides with the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. The endometrial changes are driven by progesterone and oestrogen, secreted by the corpus luteum. Steroid receptors in the endometrium activate a programme of new gene expression that over the following 7 days produces a highly regulated sequence of differentiative events, presumably required to prepare the tissue for blastocyst implantation. Part of the response is direct, but there is evidence that some of the effects are mediated through growth factors (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Fritz and Speroff 2011</a>). The first morphological effects of progesterone are evident 24–36 hours after ovulation (which occurs approximately 14 days before the next menstrual flow). During the early secretory phase, glycogen masses accumulate in the basal cytoplasm of the epithelial cells lining the glands, where they are often associated with lipids; giant mitochondria appear. There is an obviously increased polarization of the gland cells: nuclei are displaced towards the centre of the cells, and Golgi apparatus and secretory vesicles accumulate in the supranuclear cytoplasm. The nuclear channel system is prominent and the nuclei enlarge. Nascent secretory products can be detected immunohistochemically within the cells. Progestational effects on the stroma (known as the decidual reaction) are also evident in the early secretory phase. The nuclei are enlarged and the packing density of the resident stromal cells increases, due in part to the increase in volume of gland lumina and the onset of secretory activity in the epithelial compartment.</div><div class="text" id="p0515">By the mid-secretory phase, the endometrium can be up to 6<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm deep. The basal epithelial glycogen mass is progressively transferred to the apical cytoplasm and nuclei return to the cell bases. The Golgi apparatus dilates and produces glycogen, mucin and other glycoproteins, secreted from the glandular epithelium into the lumen by a combination of apocrine and merocrine mechanisms; this activity reaches a maximum 6 days after ovulation. These secretory changes are considerably less pronounced in the basal gland cells and the luminal epithelium than in the glandular cell population of the functional layer. There is a notable stromal oedema and a corresponding decrease in the density of collagen fibrils. At the same time, the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus become more prominent, and collagen is synthesized and degraded, presumably reflecting ongoing matrix remodelling.</div><div class="text" id="p0520">During the late secretory phase, glandular secretory activity declines. Decidual differentiation occurs in the superficial stromal cells that surround blood vessels; this transformation includes nuclear rounding and an increased cytoplasmic volume, reflecting an increase in and dilation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi systems, and cytoplasmic accumulation of lipid droplets and glycogen. The cells begin to produce basal lamina components including laminin and type IV collagen.</div><section><a id="s0435"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0420">Ultrasound imaging of the uterus and its contents</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0525">Ultrasound is frequently used in the clinical evaluation of the endometrium. During the early secretory phase the endometrium is identified as a thin echogenic line, a consequence of specular reflection from the interface between its opposing surfaces. During the late proliferative phase the endometrium appears as a triple layer: a central echogenic line (produced by the apposed endometrial surfaces), surrounded by a thicker hypoechoic functional layer and bounded by an outer echogenic basal layer. During the secretory phase, the functional layer surrounding the echogenic line becomes more hyperechoic because of the increased mucus and glycogen within the glands and the increased number of interfaces caused by the development of tortuous spiral arteries (<a href="#f0185"><span class="bold">Fig. 75.37</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0185"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000756/main.assets/f75-36-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0185"/><a id="fspara0185"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 75.37</span> Transvaginal ultrasound of the uterus, showing the triple-layered endometrium.

In the upper part of the functional layer (the compact layer), the necks of the glands are only slightly expanded and the stromal cells show a distinct decidual reaction. In the deeper part of the functional layer (the spongy layer) the uterine glands are tortuous, dilated and, ultimately, separated from one another by a small amount of connective tissue. The basal layer, next to the myometrium, is thin and contains the tips of the uterine glands embedded in an unaltered stroma.</div><div class="text" id="p0535">As the corpus luteum regresses, those parts of the stroma showing a decidual reaction, together with the glandular epithelium, undergo degenerative changes and the endometrium often thins. Blood escapes from the superficial vessels of the endometrium, forming small haematomata beneath the surface epithelium (see below). The functional layer, next to the free surface, is shed piecemeal, leaving mainly the basal layer adjacent to the myometrium; 65–75% of the thickness of the endometrium can be shed. Blood and necrotic endometrium then begin to appear in the uterine lumen, to be discharged from the uterus through the vagina as the menstrual flow, which usually lasts 3–6 days.</div></section><section><a id="s0445"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0430">Vascular changes within the uterus during the menstrual cycle</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0540">The vascular bed of the endometrium undergoes significant changes during the menstrual cycle. The arteries to the endometrium arise from a myometrial plexus and consist of short, straight vessels to the basal portion of the endometrium and more muscular spiral arteries to its superficial two-thirds. The venous drainage, consisting of narrow perpendicular vessels that anastomose by cross-branches, is common to both the superficial and the basal layers of the endometrium. The capillary bed consists of an endothelium with a basal lamina that is discontinuous during the proliferative phase but becomes more distinct by the mid-secretory phase. Pericytes make contact with the endothelial cells via cytoplasmic extensions that project through the basal lamina. Enlargement of the pericytes starts early in the secretory phase and leads to a conspicuous cuff of cells in the mid- and late secretory phases. The arterial supply to the basal part of the endometrium remains unchanged throughout the menstrual cycle. However, the spiral arteries supplying the compact (superficial) layer lengthen disproportionately, becoming increasingly coiled as their tips approach the uterine epithelium. This leads to a slowing of the circulation in the compact layer with some vasodilation. Immediately before the menstrual flow, these vessels begin to constrict intermittently, causing stasis of the blood and anaemia of the compact layer. During the periods of relaxation of the vessels, blood escapes from the devitalized capillaries and veins, causing the menstrual blood loss. The breakdown of the endometrium is a consequence of the falling levels of progesterone and oestrogen as the corpus luteum degenerates.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0450"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0435">Pregnancy and Parturition</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0545">During pregnancy many morphological changes occur in the female reproductive system and associated abdominal structures.

A discrepancy of more than 5–7 days from the LMP-estimated age is usually reason to revise the estimated date of confinement. For females presenting after the first trimester, gestational dating can be based on other sonographically obtained fetal biometric measurements, such as the fetal biparietal diameter, head circumference and femur length, although precision gradually decreases in later pregnancy (see <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0030">Fig. 23.5</a>).

Most of the weight gain is the result of increased vascularity and fluid retention by the myometrium. The increased growth of the uterine wall is driven by a combination of mechanical stretching and endocrine input. The mechanical load imposed on the uterine wall as gestation advances induces hypertrophy of uterine smooth muscle cells and is the major stimulus for increasing smooth muscle mass. There is some hyperplasia early in pregnancy, mainly from the growth of the media of the myometrial arteries and veins. The myometrium is relatively unresponsive to additional endocrine stimulation during most of pregnancy, a relative quiescence that is in part attributed to progesterone. However, a number of growth factors, e.g. insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), have been identified, which interact with oestrogen in promoting uterine growth.

The rigidity of the cervix appears to be related to the orientation of its collagen fibres within a regular connective tissue matrix. The cervix gradually softens and shortens in the weeks preceding labour. During active labour, the cervix dilates to allow the fetus to descend through the birth canal. The exact processes that allow softening, effacement and dilation of the cervix are unclear, but are believed to include remodelling of the connective tissue matrix, probably mediated by increased activities of enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase-1, reduced collagen concentration, a significant increase in the water content in the cervix, macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, and an increased level of apoptosis.</div><div class="text" id="p0580">Transvaginal ultrasound examination allows for a robust evaluation of the cervix during pregnancy.

In multiparous patients, diastasis (divarification) of right and left rectus abdominis can occur to accommodate the enlarging fundus of the uterus further. In the supine position, the gravid uterus can cause aortocaval compression, leading to reduced venous return to the heart and decreased cardiac output.

This condition, placenta accreta, occurs in approximately 3 per 1000 births. When the trophoblastic tissue invades the myometrium it is referred to as placenta increta; if the placental tissue reaches the uterine serosa it is called a placenta percreta. In extreme cases, a placenta percreta can also invade as far as the maternal bladder mucosa. These conditions often require a hysterectomy.

The process of labour is described in three main stages.</div><section><a id="s0485"/><section><a id="s0490"/><section><a id="s0495"/><h4 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0470">First stage</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0635">The first stage of labour is the period during which the cervix progressively dilates until the fetus is able to descend into the birth canal and the cervix of the uterus is no longer palpable on vaginal examination. There is little change in the uterine volume because myometrial contractions are isometric, so there is minimal shortening of the muscle fibres. Progress is determined by the equilibrium between forces generated by myometrial contractions, especially from the fundus, and the resistance of the cervix.</div></section><section><a id="s0500"/><h5 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0475">Second stage</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0640">The second stage of labour begins once the cervix is fully dilated, and ends with the delivery of the fetus. Cervical resistance is lost and myometrial activity results in isometric contractions that aid descent of the fetus through the birth canal. The head of the fetus usually enters the pelvis with the occiput facing laterally. As the head descends further, the occiput contacts the gutter-shaped levator ani and this promotes flexion and rotation of the occiput to the anterior position. With further descent, the occiput escapes under the pubic symphysis and the head is born by extension. At this point, the head of the fetus regains its normal relationship with its shoulders, and there is slight rotation (or restitution) of the head. Further external rotation occurs as the leading shoulder is directed medially by the maternal pelvic diaphragm. The body of the fetus is now born by lateral flexion as one shoulder slips underneath the pubic symphysis and the posterior shoulder is drawn over the frenulum of the labia minora.</div></section><section><a id="s0505"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0480">Third stage</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0645">The third stage of labour is the time from delivery of the fetus until delivery of the placenta. Prior to separation of the placenta, a large proportion of the mother’s cardiac output passes through the uterine circulation. After separation in the third stage of labour, maternal exsanguination is only prevented by marked uterine contraction; the criss-crossing myometrial fibres act as a tourniquet, restricting blood flow to the area that was the placental site. This process is usually expedited clinically by the administration of oxytocic drugs in an attempt to limit maternal blood loss. Any condition that predisposes to poor uterine contraction, such as retained placental tissue, polyhydramnios or multiple gestations, will increase the likelihood of postpartum haemorrhage (<a href="#bib37" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_37">Salafia et al 2005</a>).</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0510"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0485">Placenta after delivery</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0650">The placenta separates from the uterine wall along the plane of the functional layer and extends beyond the placental area, detaching the villous placenta with associated fibrinoid matrix and small amounts of basal decidua, the chorioamnion, together with a superficial layer of the fused capsular decidua, and the parietal decidua. When the placenta and membranes have been expelled, a thin functional layer remains above the uterine basal layer; it soon degenerates and is cast off in the early part of the puerperium.

The umbilical cord is usually attached near the centre of the fetal surface, and branches of the umbilical vessels radiate out under the amnion from this point; the veins are deeper and larger than the arteries. The maternal surface of the placenta is finely granular and mapped into some 15–30 lobes by a series of fissures or grooves. The placental lobes, which are often somewhat loosely termed cotyledons, correspond in large measure to the major branches of the umbilical vessels. The grooves correspond to the bases of incomplete placental septa, which become increasingly prominent from the end of the first trimester. They extend from the maternal aspect of the intervillous space towards the chorionic plate (see <a href="../B9780702077050000094/B9780702077050000094.xhtml#f0030">Fig. 9.5</a>) but do not quite reach it. The septa are complex structures composed of components of the cytotrophoblastic shell and residual syncytium, together with maternally-derived material including decidual cells, occasional blood vessels and gland remnants, collagenous and fibrinoid extracellular matrix, and, in the later months of pregnancy, foci of degeneration.</div><div class="text" id="p0665">In multiple pregnancies, the number of placentas is determined by the zygosity; for example, in twin gestations, dizygotic pregnancies will always have two placentas (dichorionic). Monozygotic pregnancies usually have a single placenta (monochorionic), but about one-third will have two; the number is determined by the timing of splitting of the embryonic mass (see <a href="../B9780702077050000082/B9780702077050000082.xhtml">Ch. 8</a> and <a href="../B9780702077050000082/B9780702077050000082.xhtml#f0050">Fig. 8.9</a>). If the split occurs within 3 days of fertilization, each fetus will have its own placenta and amniotic sac (dichorionic diamniotic); splitting after the third day following fertilization results in a monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy (two amniotic sacs) and vascular communication within the two placental <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1330" id="pagebreak_1330"/><a id="pg1330"/> circulations (<a href="#f0225"><span class="bold">Fig. 75.44</span></a>); splitting after the ninth day results in a single placenta and single amniotic sac (monochorionic monoamniotic); and splitting after the twelfth day results in conjoined twins.</div><div id="p0670"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0225"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000756/main.assets/on75-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0235"/><a id="fspara0225"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 75.44</span> A vascular cast from a monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy, showing vascular communications between the two placentas. <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Dr Ling Wee, University College London Hospital.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><section><a id="s0515"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0490">Placental variations</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0675">The umbilical cord is usually attached near the centre of the placenta, although it can occasionally insert more laterally and closer to the placental margin; this condition is known as a battledore placenta (<a href="#f0230"><span class="bold">Fig. 75.45</span></a>). Occasionally, the cord fails to reach the placenta itself and ends in the membranes as a velamentous insertion. When insertion of the cord is velamentous, the larger branches of the umbilical vessels traverse the membranes before they reach and ramify on the placenta (<a href="#f0235"><span class="bold">Fig. 75.46</span></a>). They travel unprotected through the membranes to the placenta, and this puts the fetus at risk because compression or tearing of the vessels can disrupt blood flow to and from it. This can be particularly problematic when the vessels present themselves across the external os of the uterus, a condition called vasa praevia. An accessory (succenturiate) placental lobe is occasionally present, connected to the main organ by membranes and blood vessels. If it is inadvertently retained <span class="italic">in utero</span> after delivery of the main placental mass it can cause postpartum haemorrhage or infection. Other variations include membranous placenta, in which villous stems and their branches persist over the whole chorion; and vallate (circumvallate) placenta, where the placental margin is undercut by a deep groove caused by an abnormally central insertion of the membranes (<a href="#f0240"><span class="bold">Fig. 75.47</span></a>).</div><div id="p0680"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure
