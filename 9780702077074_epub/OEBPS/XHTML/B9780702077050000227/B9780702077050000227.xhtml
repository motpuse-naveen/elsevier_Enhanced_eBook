Predictive fates of epiblast cells that transform to mesenchyme on ingression through the primitive streak show temporally specified induction of cells that ingress later than those that form the lateral halves of the somites and earlier than mesoblast forming the lateral plate, and become epithelial coelomic wall at the end of their migration (see <a href="../B9780702077050000100/B9780702077050000100.xhtml#f0020">Fig. 10.3</a>). The rostral limit of the intermediate mesenchymal population, in stage 10 embryos, is lateral to somite 6. It lengthens caudally during development, and is sited (in the folded embryo) at the junction between the splanchnopleuric mesenchyme (surrounding the gut medially) and the somatopleuric mesenchyme (subjacent to the ectoderm laterally). Ultimately it blends with splanchnopleuric mesenchyme around the cloaca (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 22.1</span></a>). After the early migration of mesoblast, further intermediate mesenchyme is formed by proliferation of the overlying coelomic epithelial wall to give a ventrally projecting urogenital ridge (previously termed the nephrogenic cord).

The dorsal wall of a nephrotome evaginates as a nephric tubule. The dorsal tips of the cranial nephric tubules bend caudally and fuse to form a longitudinal primary excretory duct, which grows caudally and curves ventrally to open into the cloaca. The more caudally placed, and therefore chronologically later, tubules open secondarily into this duct or into tubular outgrowths from it. Glomeruli, specific arrangements of capillaries and overlying coelomic epithelium, arise from the ventral wall of the nephrocele (internal glomeruli) or the coelomic wall adjacent to the peritoneal funnels (coelomic or external glomeruli), or in both situations (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 22.2</a>).

It is difficult to provide reliable criteria by which to distinguish these stages or to define their precise limits in human embryos. Much of the knowledge on development of the meso- and meta-nephros comes from experimental studies of mouse embryos and more recently from <span class="italic">in vitro</span> study of human stem cell-derived kidney organoids. Although kidney development is evolutionarily conserved in mammals, there are significant heterochronic differences between murine and human development that make direct extrapolation between the species unwise; similarly, extrapolation of <span class="italic">in vitro</span> conditions to <span class="italic">in vivo</span> development should be treated with caution.</div><section><a id="s0020"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0030">Pronephros</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0025">A pronephros is present in human embryos only as clusters of cells in the most cranial portions of the urogenital ridge (see <a href="#f0010">Figs 22.1</a>–<a href="#f0015">22.2</a>). <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="342" id="pagebreak_342"/><a id="pg342"/>More caudally, similar groups of cells appear and become vesicular.

Its cranial end is about the level of somite 9 and its caudal tip merges with the undifferentiated mesenchyme of the ridge. It differentiates before any nephric tubules and, when the latter appear, it is at first unconnected with them. In older embryos, the duct has lengthened and its caudal end becomes detached from the urogenital ridge to lie beneath the ectoderm. From this level, it grows caudally, independent of the nephrogenic mesenchyme, and then curves ventrally to reach the wall of the cloaca. The lumen develops progressively from its caudal end to form a true duct, which opens into the cloaca in stage 12 embryos.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0040">Mesonephros</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0035">From stage 12 mesonephric tubules, which develop from the intermediate (now nephrogenic) mesenchyme between somite levels 8 and 20, begin to connect to the primary excretory duct, which is now renamed the mesonephric duct. More caudally, a continuous ridge of nephrogenic mesenchyme extends to the level of somite 24. The mesonephric tubules (nephrons) are not metameric and there may be two or more mesonephric tubules opposite each somite.</div><div class="text" id="p0040">Within the mesonephros, each tubule first appears as a condensation of mesenchyme cells that epithelialize and form a vesicle. One end of the vesicle grows towards and opens into the mesonephric duct, while the other dilates and invaginates. The outer stratum forms the glomerular capsule, while the inner cells differentiate into mesonephric podocytes that clothe the invaginating capillaries to form a glomerulus. The capillaries are supplied with blood through lateral branches of the aorta. It has been estimated that 70–80 mesonephric tubules and a corresponding number of glomeruli develop. However, these tubules are not all present at the same time: it is rare to find more than 30–40 in an individual embryo because the cranial tubules and glomeruli develop and atrophy before those situated more caudally have developed.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">By stage 17 each mesonephros is an elongated, spindle-shaped organ that projects into the coelomic cavity, one on each side of the dorsal mesentery, from the level of the septum transversum to the third lumbar segment.

It develops subregions, and the suprarenal gland and gonad develop on its medial surface. There are striking similarities in structure between the mesonephros and the permanent kidney or metanephros, but the mesonephric nephrons lack a segment that corresponds to the descending limb of the loop of Henle. The mesonephros is believed to produce urine by stage 17. A detailed comparison of the development and function of the mesonephros and metanephros in staged human embryos is not available.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0020"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000227/main.assets/f22-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0020"/><a id="fspara0020"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 22.3</span> The relative positions of the mesonephros and early gonad in the abdomen in the ambisexual stage of development.

In both sexes, the cranial end of the mesonephros atrophies. In stage 19 embryos a mesonephros is found only in the first three lumbar segments, although it may still possess as many as 26 tubules. The most cranial one or two tubules persist as rostral aberrant ductules (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 22.13</a>); the succeeding five or six tubules develop into either the efferent ductules of the testis and lobules of the head of the epididymis (male), or the tubules of the epoophoron (female); the caudal tubules form the caudal aberrant ductules and the paradidymis (male), or the paroophoron (female).</div><section><a id="s0040"/><section><a id="s0045"/><h4 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0045">Mesonephric duct</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0055">Once mesonephric nephrons connect to the primary excretory duct, it is renamed the mesonephric duct. This runs caudally in the lateral part of the urogenital ridge, and projects into the cavity of the coelom in the substance of a mesonephric fold at the caudal end of the ridge (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 22.3</a>). As the mesonephric ducts from each side approach the urogenital sinus (see below) the two mesonephric folds fuse, forming a transverse partition across the cavity of the pelvis, somewhat inappropriately called the genital cord (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 22.3</a>). The insertion of the mesonephric duct into the urogenital sinus occurs at stage 13 and remains associated with segmental levels 31–32 (S2–S3) as the embryo lengthens (<a href="#bib75" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_75">Kruepunga et al 2018</a>).

The allantois and enteric hindgut portions of the cloaca are separated, from stage 15, by the proliferation of the urorectal septum, a partition of mesenchyme and endodermal cloacal wall in the angle of the junction of enteric hindgut and allantois (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 22.4</span></a>; see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 22.7</a>).

Both membranes break down during stages 18–20. The urogenital sinus is continuous cranially with the allantoic duct within the connecting stalk. During development it forms the vesico-urethral canal with a middle, narrow channel, the pelvic portion, and a caudal, deep, phallic section that is open to the amniotic cavity.

They both contain stacks of tubules distributed along the craniocaudal axis of the embryo, an arrangement that results in the production of hypotonic urine in the embryo and fetus. In the mesonephric kidney, development proceeds in a craniocaudal progression, and cranial nephrons degenerate before caudal ones are produced. In the metanephric kidney, development is patterned radially such that the outer cortex is the last part to be formed, and nephrons are arranged concentrically with the loops <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="344" id="pagebreak_344"/><a id="pg344"/>of Henle directed towards the renal pelvis. This arrangement allows different concentration gradients to develop within the metanephric kidney and results in the production of hypertonic urine.</div><div class="text" id="p0070">The metanephric kidney develops from three sources from stage 13. An evagination of the mesonephric duct, the ureteric bud, and a local condensation of mesenchyme, the metanephric blastema, form the nephric structures (<a href="#f0030"><span class="bold">Fig. 22.5</span></a>). Angiogenic mesenchyme migrates into the metanephric blastema slightly later to produce the glomeruli and vasa recta. It is possible that an intact nerve supply is also required for metanephric kidney induction. A range of intra- and extracellular factors potentially involved in metanephric development have been discussed (<a href="#bib73" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_73">Kanwar et al 2004</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0030"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000227/main.assets/f22-05-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0030"/><a id="fspara0030"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 22.5</span> An overview of metanephric kidney development. <span class="bold">A</span>, The ureteric bud arises from the mesonephric duct.

Although the timing of human development differs from that in other mammalian species that have been described, similar growth and transcription factors are thought to underpin kidney development (<a href="#bib39" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_39">Davidson 2009</a>, <a href="#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_19">Batchelder et al 2010</a>, <a href="#bib46" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_46">Faa et al 2012</a>, <a href="#bib27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_27">Chai et al 2013</a>). The ureteric bud bifurcates when it comes into contact with the metanephric blastema in response to extracellular matrix molecules synthesized by the mesenchyme. Both chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan synthesis and chondroitin sulphate glycosaminoglycan processing are necessary for branching of the ureteric bud. The proximal part of the ureteric bud elongates to form the developing ureter and the first generation of branches form the major and minor calyces of the renal pelvis (see <a href="#f0035">Fig. 22.6</a>). Further ureteric branches form the collecting ducts and as they elongate the metanephric mesenchyme condenses adjacent to each of them. An adhesion molecule, syndecan, can be detected between the mesenchymal cells in the condensate. The cells switch off expression of neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM), fibronectin and collagen I, and start to synthesize liver cell adhesion molecule (L-CAM; also called E cadherin) and the basal lamina constituents, laminin and collagen IV. The mesenchymal clusters are thus converted to small groups of epithelial cells that undergo complex morphogenetic changes. Each epithelial group elongates, initially forming a comma-shaped, and then an S-shaped, body, with a dilated sac at its proximal end and an elongating distal end that subsequently fuses with a collecting duct (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 22.5</a>). Each dilated sac invaginates to form a cup: the outer cells become parietal, glomerular capsule cells, and the inner ones become visceral, epithelial podocytes. The podocytes develop in close proximity to the angiogenic <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="345" id="pagebreak_345"/><a id="pg345"/>mesenchyme of invading capillaries which give rise to the endothelial and mesangial cells of the glomerulus. Both cell lines contribute to components of the glomerular basement membrane. The direct mutual support of two epithelial layers, rather than support of an epithelium by an underlying lamina propria, is unusual and seen only in the lung and brain (see <a href="../B9780702077050000112/B9780702077050000112.xhtml#f0015">Fig. 11.2</a>. Podocytes and endothelial cells contribute to the generation of mutual basal laminal proteins and the formation of the glomerular basement membrane. The isoforms of type IV collagen within this layer follow a specific programme of maturation as the filtration of macromolecules from the plasma becomes restricted. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) β-chain and the PDGF receptor β-subunit (PDGFR β) have been detected between stage 23 and the end of the first trimester; PDGF β-chain has been localized in the dilated epithelial sac during its comma- and S-shaped stages and PDGFR β is expressed in the undifferentiated metanephric blastema, vascular structures and interstitial cells. Both PDGF β-chain and PDGFR β are expressed by mesangial cells, which may promote further mesangial cell proliferation. Innervation is also necessary for metanephric development: nephrogenesis is completely blocked if developing kidney rudiments are incubated with antisense oligonucleotides that neutralize nerve growth factor receptor (NGF-R) mRNA. With continuing elongation of the collecting ducts and adjacent coalescence of mesenchymal cells, all stages of nephron differentiation can be seen concurrently (see <a href="#f0030">Fig. 22.5C</a>). A number of genes involved in the development of the renal medulla and vasa recta in the mouse have been identified (<a href="#bib118" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_118">Song and Yosypiv 2012</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0080">Metanephric mesenchyme will develop successfully <span class="italic">in vitro</span>, which makes experimental perturbation of non-human kidney development comparatively easy to evaluate. Early experimental studies demonstrated that other mesenchymal populations, and spinal cord, were able to induce ureteric bud division and metanephric development. Culture of hiPSC along a kidney lineage has resulted in the generation of nephron progenitor cells and kidney organoids which are being used to study aspects of podocyte development (<a href="#bib109" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_109">Shamin et al 2016</a>, <a href="#bib52" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_52">Hale et al 2018</a>). Time-lapse study of cultured mouse embryonic kidney has shown that the original branching morphogenesis of the collecting ducts (from the ureteric bud) changes during maturation such that the branching point moved centripetally. This may promote elongation of outer cortical collecting ducts, resulting in a renal pattern rather than <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="346" id="pagebreak_346"/><a id="pg346"/>one that would result from repeated dichotomous branching morphogenesis. Biomechanical factors generated by the outer renal capsule may contribute to these temporal specifications of epithelial mesenchymal interactions (<a href="#bib86" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_86">Lindström et al 2015</a>).</div><section><a id="s0060"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0060">Fetal kidney maturation</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0085">Nephrons are added to the metanephric kidney throughout the fetal period with different temporal patterning. The earliest ureteric bud branches are absorbed into the renal pelvis so that an average of 44 collecting ducts open into 8 papillae. After the 13th to 15th branching, several metanephric mesenchymal to epithelial transformations can occur along adjacent collecting ducts, forming arcades of juxtaglomerular nephrons in the inner renal cortex. The mid and outer renal cortices are induced by collecting tubules that elongate towards the renal capsule. Addition of new nephrons in the outermost cortex occurs by metanephric mesenchymal induction at collecting duct tips, at a constant average of 83<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm from the inner side of the renal capsule, with only two layers of mesenchyme intervening (<a href="#bib92" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_92">Minuth 2018</a>). This subcapsular region of the developing kidney is called the nephrogenic zone. It contains angiogenic mesenchymal populations forming embryonic blood vessels, which means that the tissues are at lower oxygen tension than more central regions where endothelial glomeruli are established. It has been suggested, on the basis of animal experimentation, that increased oxygen tension promotes glomerular differentiation, whereas low oxygen tension maintains stem cell populations and continued developmental interactions (<a href="#bib108" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_108">Rymer et al 2014</a>).

Before birth, homeostasis is controlled by the placenta. The fetal kidney produces amniotic fluid.

Problems of immaturity are further compounded by the effects of hypoxia and asphyxia, which modify renal hormones.</div><div class="text" id="p0110">Renal hormones include the renin–angiotensin system, renal prostaglandins, the kallikrein–kinin system and renal dopamine. Renin is found in the smooth muscle cells of arterioles, interlobular arteries and branches of the renal artery, and has also been described in the distal convoluted tubule cells. Renal dopamine is produced (mainly) by the enzymatic conversion of <span class="smallcaps">L</span>-dopa to dopamine in the early segments of the proximal convoluted tubule, and is also sourced locally from dopaminergic nerves. Other renal hormones include an antihypertensive lipid produced in the interstitial cells of the renal medulla, and, possibly, histamine and serotonin.

During this period the ascending kidney receives its blood supply sequentially from arteries in its immediate neighbourhood, i.e. the middle sacral and common iliac arteries. The definitive renal artery is not recognizable until the beginning of the third month. It arises from the most caudal of the three suprarenal arteries, all of which represent persistent mesonephric or lateral splanchnic arteries. Additional renal arteries are relatively common, and may enter at the hilum or at the upper or lower pole; they also represent persistent mesonephric arteries.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0075"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0075">Ureter</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0120">At first, the distal end of the ureter is connected to the dorsomedial aspect of the mesonephric duct but, as a result of differential growth, this connection comes to lie lateral to the duct. The wall of the early ureter is initially highly permeable. Its lumen later becomes obliterated and is subsequently recanalized. Both of these processes begin in intermediate portions of the ureter and proceed cranially and caudally. Recanalization is not associated with metanephric function, but perhaps reflects the rapid elongation of the ureter as the embryo grows. Two fusiform enlargements appear at the lumbar and pelvic levels of the ureter at 5 and 9 months, respectively (the pelvic enlargement is inconstant). As a result, the ureter shows a constriction at its proximal end (pelviureteric region) and another as it crosses the pelvic brim. A third narrowing is always present at its distal end and is related to the growth of the bladder wall. Ureteric smooth muscle differentiation occurs from the ureterovesical junction to the ureteropelvic junction. The processes that occur during the development of typical and atypical smooth muscle cells that generate ureteric peristaltic waves are unknown. Interstitial cells of Cajal-like cells have been identified in mouse embryos before ureteric pacemaker activity first occurs (<a href="#bib98" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_98">Rassouly and Lu 2013</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0080"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0080">Urinary bladder</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0125">The urinary bladder develops from the cranial vesico-urethral canal, which is continuous above with the allantoic duct (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 22.4</a>; <a href="#f0035"><span class="bold">Figs 22.6</span></a>–<a href="#f0040"><span class="bold">22.7</span></a>).

The apex of the contracted bladder, which has a distinct interureteric fold, lies at a point midway between the pubis and the umbilicus.

Problems with kidney ascent can result in a pelvic kidney. Alternatively, the kidneys may fuse together at their caudal poles, producing a horseshoe kidney that cannot ascend out of the pelvic cavity because the inferior mesenteric artery prevents its further migration. A duplex kidney arises when two ureteric buds meet the metanephros; it is characterized by two pelvicalyceal systems and is associated with ureterocele, ectopic insertion of the ureter and vesico-ureteric reflux.</div><div class="text" id="p0190">It was thought that renal cysts arose from clumps of vesicular cells that persisted when the tips of branches from the ureteric diverticulum failed to fuse with metanephrogenic cap tissue.

In this condition, the urorectal septum (internal) is associated with the genital tubercle (external), which means that the urogenital and anal membranes are widely separated. When the urogenital membrane involutes, the posterior surface of the bladder is exposed to the ventral abdominal wall. The lower part of the abdominal wall is therefore occupied by an irregularly oval area, covered with mucous membrane, onto which the two ureters open. The periphery of this extroverted area, which is covered by urothelium, becomes continuous with the skin. The innervation of the underlying detrusor muscle seems to be normal, but the muscle has a decreased number of smooth muscle cells and an increased amount of collagen, which means that the bladder may have reduced contractile performance after reconstruction (<a href="#bib68" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_68">Johal et al 2019</a>). Bladder exstrophy is a complex condition involving the development of the pelvis, cloaca, urorectal septum, urogenital sinus, urethral plate, external genital tissues and all of the associated autonomic and somatic nerves supplying the region.

Absence of the bladder, low insertion of the umbilical cord and bony pelvic anomalies on routine antenatal ultrasound examination would suggest the presence of bladder exstrophy in a fetus, however, it has been reported that only 25% of those neonates born with this condition were diagnosed antenatally. Its postnatal repair is exceedingly complex and has not been completely successful in establishing continence and a bladder capable of voluntary voiding.

The volume of amniotic fluid is used as an indicator of renal function but does not reflect fetal urinary output until the second trimester. Although variation in the amount of amniotic fluid may suggest anomalies of either the gut or the kidneys, it is not always possible to correlate even severe oligohydramnios (too little amniotic fluid) with renal dysfunction. There is an important relationship between the volume of amniotic fluid, lung development and maturity: oligohydramnios has been shown to be associated with pulmonary hypoplasia (<a href="../B9780702077050000203/B9780702077050000203.xhtml">Ch. 20</a>).</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0105"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0100">Suprarenal Glands</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0205">The suprarenal (adrenal) gland is first seen in the human embryo at stage 14 as a specific proliferative region of the coelomic epithelium on the ventromedial surface of the urogenital ridge. Cells pass into the underlying mesenchyme between the root of the dorsal mesogastrium and the mesonephros (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0035">Fig. 14.6A</a>). The proliferating tissue extends from the level of the thoracic segments 6–12, and is soon disorganized dorsomedially by invasion of neural crest cells from somite levels 18–24 (see <a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml#f0095">Fig. 14.20</a>) that form the suprarenal medulla, and by the development of venous sinusoids. The latter are joined by capillaries that arise from adjacent mesonephric arteries and penetrate the cortex in a radial manner. By stage 18, the suprarenal gland is larger than the adjacent degenerating mesonephros and the developing, cranially ascending, metanephros. It remains larger than the metanephros (which touches it by stage 20), but as metanephric growth continues the suprarenal gland becomes relatively smaller by postmenstrual week 10 (see relative size at postmenstrual week 14 in <a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml#f0075">Fig. 23.14F–I</a>). As the suprarenal gland grows it is the most cranial viscus related to the developing pleuroperitoneal membrane (which contributes to the respiratory diaphragm). Initially this membrane is located on the ventral side of the suprarenal gland, gonad and mesonephros, but as the body wall is excavated during the formation of the costodiaphragmatic recess, the pleuroperitoneal membrane and associated mesenchyme become dorsal to the suprarenal gland and degenerating mesonephros during stages 16–17 (<a href="#bib56" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_56">Hayashi et al 2011</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0210">When proliferation of the coelomic epithelium stops, the cortex is enveloped ventrally, and later dorsally, by a mesenchymal capsule derived from the dorsolateral mesonephros. The subcapsular nests of cortical cells are the rudiments of the zona glomerulosa and they proliferate cords of cells that pass deeply between the capillaries and sinusoids. The cells in these cords degenerate in an erratic fashion as they pass towards the medulla; they become granular, eosinophilic and ultimately they autolyse. These cords of cells constitute the fetal cortex, which undergoes rapid involution during the first 2 postnatal years. Molecular aspects of the development of the early and fetal suprarenal gland have been reviewed (<a href="#bib105" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_105">Ross and Louw 2015</a>, <a href="#bib88" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_88">Lotfi et al 2018</a>).

Cortisol is produced by the end of the first trimester and the gland is highly active throughout the second trimester. Early steroid synthesis provides substrates for placental oestrogen production: fetal steroid concentrations do not change after postmenstrual week 12. The fetal suprarenal gland does not produce aldosterone during the second trimester, suggesting that salt-wasting disorders, frequently seen in extreme preterm infants, may occur because of this limited early capacity for aldosterone production. Maternal smoking affects fetal suprarenal function and the development of the HPA axis, with reported alterations of placental function, reduced cortisol levels and response to stress in the first postnatal month (<a href="#bib70" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_70">Johnston et al 2018</a>).</div><section><a id="s0111"/><section><a id="s0110"/><h3 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0105">Ultrasound examination of the suprarenal gland</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0220">A range of anthropometric studies have been published to aid identification of abnormal growth.

Mutations in the <span class="italic">CYP21A2</span> gene, on chromosome 6p, is found in 90–95% of affected individuals. The levels of androgens increase in this condition by several hundred times, causing female embryos and fetuses to undergo external genital masculinization ranging from clitoral hypertrophy to the formation of a phallus and scrotum.

Bilateral paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts develop alongside the mesonephric ducts, and the midportion of each mesonephros undergoes thickening to form the gonadal ridge. Although the primordial germ cells are delineated very early in development, they are sequestered in the extraembryonic tissues until the gonadal ridge is ready to receive them. It was thought that development to one or other sexual phenotype occurred after migration of the primordial germ cells to the indifferent gonads. However, it is now recognized that the development of male or female gonads, genital ducts and external genitalia is far more complicated, and is the result of a complex interplay between genetic expression, timing of development and the influence of sex hormones. As development proceeds, a significant proportion of early embryonic urinary tissue is incorporated into the reproductive tracts, especially in the male. The earliest stage of reproductive development, prior to the arrival of the primordial germ cells into the gonad, is termed the indifferent or ambisexual stage.</div><section><a id="s0135"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0125">Early gonadal development (ambisexual or indifferent stage)</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0245">Essentially, four different cell lineages contribute to the gonads.

Elsewhere on the surface of the ridge, the coelomic epithelium is one or two cells thick, but over this gonadal area it becomes multilayered. Thickening rapidly extends in a longitudinal direction until it covers nearly the whole of the medial surface of the ridge. The thickened epithelium continues to proliferate, displacing the renal corpuscles of the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="352" id="pagebreak_352"/>mesonephros in a dorsolateral direction, and forms a projection into the coelomic cavity: the gonadal ridge. Surface depressions form along the limits of the ridge, which is thus connected to the mesonephros by a broad mesentery, the mesogenitale. In this way, the mesonephric ridge becomes subdivided into a lateral part, the tubal fold, containing the mesonephric and paramesonephric ducts, and a medial part, the gonadal fold.

Throughout the extent of the mesonephros, it is lateral to the mesonephric duct, which acts as a guide for it.

If the bladder contains only a small amount of urine, the uterus may be anteverted but it is often in a direct line with the vagina (see <a href="#f0095">Figs 22.9</a>, <a href="#f0050">22.19</a>). The uterus subsequently involutes to about one-third of its length and more than half of its weight; it does not regain its neonatal size and weight until puberty.</div><section><a id="s0150"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0140">Vagina</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0285">At approximately postmenstrual week 12, an endodermal epithelial proliferation, the sinuvaginal bulb, arises from the dorsal wall of the urogenital sinus in the region of the sinus tubercle.

It is thought that the epithelial cells of the paramesonephric duct initially undergo apoptosis, and that once the epithelial cells no longer secrete a basal lamina, the remaining ductal epithelial cells transform into mesenchyme that remains in the vicinity of the involuting duct (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Allard et al 2000</a>). Vestigial remnants of the paramesonephric ducts are most likely to persist cranially and/or caudally, at the limits of the local exocrine effects of AMH. A vestige of the cranial end of the duct persists as the appendix testis (see <a href="#f0065">Figs 22.13</a>, <a href="#f0095">22.19</a>; see <a href="#t0010">Table 22.1</a>). The fused caudal ends of the two ducts are connected to the wall of the urogenital sinus by a solid utricular cord of cells that soon merges with a proliferation of sinus epithelium, the sinu-utricular cord, that is similar to, but less extensive than, the sinus proliferation in the female. The proliferating epithelium is claimed to be an intermingling of the endoderm of the urogenital sinus with the lining epithelia of the mesonephric and paramesonephric ducts, which have extended on to the surface of the sinus tubercle. As the sinu-utricular cord grows, so the utricular cord recedes from the tubercle. In the second half of fetal life, the composite cord acquires a lumen and becomes dilated to form the prostatic utricle, the lining of which consists of hyperplastic stratified squamous epithelium. The sinus tubercle becomes the colliculus seminalis.</div><div class="text" id="p0315">The main reproductive ducts in the male are derived from the mesonephric ducts, which persist under the action of androgens that are probably secreted down the ducts themselves, and are subsumed into the male reproductive system as the metanephric kidney develops. The mesonephric duct gives rise to the canal of the epididymis, ductus (vas) deferens and ejaculatory duct. It is possible that the extensive lengthening and coiling of the epididymis is a local example of buckling morphogenesis produced by biomechanical tension in the surrounding tissues (<a href="#bib58" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_58">Hirashima 2014</a>). The seminal gland and the ampulla of the ductus deferens appear as a common swelling at the end of the mesonephric duct during the end of the third and into the fourth months. Their appearance coincides with degeneration of the paramesonephric ducts, although no causal relation between the two events has been established. Separation into two rudiments occurs at about 125<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm crown–heel length.

It is not yet clear whether the primordial germ cells are derived from particular blastomeres during cleavage, if they constitute a clonal line from a single blastomere, or if they are the product of a progressive concentration of the nucleus of the fertilized ovum by unequal partition at successive mitoses. Primordial germ cells spend the early stages of development within the extraembryonic tissues near the end of the primitive streak and in the connecting stalk (see <a href="../B9780702077050000100/B9780702077050000100.xhtml#f0025">Fig. 10.4E</a>).

When the tail fold has formed, they appear within the endoderm and the splanchnopleuric mesenchyme and epithelium of the hindgut, as well as in the adjoining region of the wall of the yolk sac. They migrate dorsocranially in the mesentery, by amoeboid movements and by growth displacement, and pass around the dorsal angles of the coelom (medial coelomic bays) to reach the genital ridges from stage 15 (see <a href="#f0080">Fig. 22.16</a>). It is believed that the genital ridges exert long-range effects on the migrating primordial germ cells, in terms of controlling their direction of migration and supporting the primordial germ-cell population. Primordial germ cells contact each other via long processes and retain cytoplasmic bridges when they divide. They are usually in close proximity to somatic cells, which may modify the local environment, forming junctional complexes with them. The surface of primordial germ cells displays binding sites for extracellular matrix macromolecules. A range of molecular markers associated with the migration and proliferation of primordial germ cells has been described (<a href="#bib119" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_119">Soto-Suazo and Zorn 2005</a>, <a href="#bib106" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_106">Runyan et al 2006</a>, <a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">De Felici 2013</a>).

They become determined as Sertoli cells (also called sustenocytes) and form the walls of the seminiferous tubules encroaching on and uniting with a medullary network of mesonephric mesenchyme which forms the rete testis (see <a href="#f0065">Figs 22.13</a>, <a href="#f0080">22.16</a>). Sertoli cells proliferate throughout fetal and early postnatal life (see mini puberty, <a href="#pg364">p. 364</a>) and perhaps again at the initiation of puberty (<a href="#bib111" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_111">Sharpe et al 2003</a>); once dividing ceases the cells mature and cannot be reactivated. Primordial germ cells are incorporated into the early cords and between the dividing Sertoli cells. The number of Sertoli cells produced at this early time determines the maximal limit of adult sperm production, as each Sertoli cell can only support a fixed number of proliferating primordial germ cells (<a href="#bib111" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Sharpe et al 2003</a>). Because developing and maturing spermatogonia make up the bulk of the adult testis, the number of Sertoli cells is a major determinant of the size to which the testes will grow (factors that impair the process of spermatogenesis, resulting in the loss of primordial germ cells, will also affect testicular size). Variation in Sertoli cell number is probably the most important factor in accounting for the enormous variation in sperm counts between individual males, whether fertile or infertile. Indeed, the available data for adult males indicate that Sertoli cell numbers vary across a 50-fold range (<a href="#bib111" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Sharpe et al 2003</a>). Although some of this variation may result from attrition of Sertoli cell numbers because of ageing, the major differences in Sertoli cell numbers will have been determined by events in fetal life and/or childhood, with parental epigenetic effects also contributing (<a href="#bib110" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_110">Sharpe 2010</a>). In mammals, the testis–blood barrier is formed by tight junctions between adjoining Sertoli cell at the basal region of the seminiferous tubule adjacent to the epithelial basal lamina and actin-rich adherens junctions termed ectoplasmic specializations (<a href="#bib135" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_135">Wen et al 2018</a>): it is not yet known when this occurs in humans. Early blood vessels form between the seminiferous tubules and appear to form around clusters of Leydig cells.</div><div class="text" id="p0350">The interstitial cells of the testis are derived from mesenchyme and, possibly, also from coelomic epithelial cells that do not become incorporated into the tubules.

The mesonephric duct, which was the primitive ‘ureter’ of the mesonephros, becomes the canal of the epididymis and the ductus deferens of the testis.

The incidence of testicular germ cell cancer has increased over the past 60 years and appears to be caused by environmental/lifestyle causes rather than genetic factors. Risk of testicular germ cell cancers in migrant males is comparable to their original country of origin, whereas the risk to children born in a country to which their parents have emigrated is the same as in that country. The development of fewer Sertoli cells during fetal and early postnatal life and at the initiation of puberty directly affects the number of spermatogenic germ cells that the testis can support.</div><div class="text" id="p0365">In the relatively recent past, prospective, well-standardized studies undertaken across Europe have documented a fall in sperm counts of around 40–50% (1% per year over the last 50 years); 15–20% of young males have an abnormally low sperm count (less than 20 million sperm per ml based on WHO standards); and only 5–15% of the sperm produced can be classified as normal (depending on the strictness of the criteria of normality used) (<a href="#bib34" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_34">Cooper et al 2010</a>, <a href="#bib110" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Sharpe 2010</a>).

Imbalance between the genes promoting or suppressing Sertoli/follicle cells and Leydig/theca cells that extends throughout fetal and postnatal life is noted in disorders of sex development, leading to male to female or female to male transition.

The cortical epithelial clusters become determined as follicle cells and surround the primordial germ cells (now identified as primary oocytes) that have entered the prophase of the first meiotic division. Primary oocytes are derived from a mitotic division of the primordial germ cells (naked oogonia). Flattened epithelial follicle cells (also termed pregranulosa cells) coalesce around them producing primordial follicles from about postmenstrual week 13. Placental-derived oestrogens promote an increase in primordial follicle development after postmenstrual weeks 14–15, when about 100,000 are present; this number increases to 680,000 by postmenstrual week 34 when some of these follicles mature.

The expression is seen first in cells designated as pre-Sertoli, located centrally in the developing gonad, and then later in the cranial and caudal poles. Once the developmental pathway of Sertoli cells has been initiated, the differentiation of the other cell types in the testicular pathway follows: Leydig cells subsequently appear, and the connective tissue becomes organized into a male pattern. The germ cells are also affected by this environment. When they arrive, they become enclosed within the Sertoli cells, do not enter meiosis and continue to proliferate (which is characteristic of spermatogenesis), instead of ceasing proliferation and entering meiosis and meiotic arrest, as occurs in the ovary.

Of these, testosterone is the most important, because it has body-wide effects, both on the developing reproductive system/genitalia and on numerous other organs/tissues, including the brain. The development of the appropriate cytoplasmic testosterone-binding receptor protein (the androgen receptor) is also important. Sertoli cells synthesize AMH, which causes the regression of the Müllerian ducts, and Leydig cells produce testosterone, which promotes the development of the mesonephric ducts, sets into process the development of male external genitalia, and sensitizes other tissues to testosterone. Absence of a functional androgen receptor, as occurs in the complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), results in XY individuals who have testes and degenerated Müllerian ducts, but cannot respond to the circulating testosterone produced by their testes and therefore develop female secondary sexual characteristics.</div></section><section><a id="s0200"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0180">Descent of the gonads</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0430">The gonads develop on the posterior abdominal wall bilaterally along the central portion of the mesonephros.

It also acquires a secondary attachment to the ventral abdominal wall that has a considerable influence on its subsequent movements. At the point where the mesonephric fold bends medially to form the genital cord (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 22.3</a>), each testis becomes connected to the lower part of the ventral abdominal wall by an inguinal fold of coelomic wall that covers a mesenchymal cord, the gubernaculum or genito-inguinal ligament (see <a href="#f0065">Figs 22.3</a>, <a href="#f0020">22.13</a>; <a href="#f0085"><span class="bold">Fig. 22.17</span></a>).

This serves to anchor the fetal testis near the future inguinal canal as the abdominal cavity enlarges between postmenstrual weeks 12–15. By comparison, the gubernaculum in females remains thin and subsequently develops into the round ligament (see <a href="#t0010">Table 22.1</a>; <a href="#pg359">p. 359</a>).

The caudal end of the gubernaculum is initially associated with a specific portion of the milk line of the abdominal wall around which the future inguinal canal is formed by differentiating abdominal wall muscles. An interaction with the mammary line ectoderm and underlying mesenchyme may trigger gubernacular meristematic growth similar to that seen in the progress zone of the limb bud. Between postmenstrual weeks 25 and 35, the male gubernaculum begins to bulge out from the abdominal muscles and elongate across the pubis and into the scrotum (see <a href="#f0085">Fig. 22.17</a>). A specific evagination of the coelomic wall continuous with the peritoneal cavity, the processus vaginalis, extends into the gubernaculum, hollowing it out so that the proximal part is divided into a crescentic parietal layer within which the cremaster muscle develops, and a central column attached to the epididymis. Elongation of the soft, gelatinous end of the gubernaculum, which, in the early stage, is formed mainly of hyaluronic acid, is controlled by androgens. The exact mechanisms mediating gubernacular growth in humans are still unclear (<a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Barthold and Ivell 2018</a>). In rodent models, there is good evidence that androgens cause sexual dimorphism of the sensory branches of the genitofemoral nerve, which supplies the gubernaculum, the developing cremaster muscle within it, and part of the scrotum. The genital branch of the nerve releases calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which stimulates growth of the gubernacular tip along a chemotactic gradient to the scrotum.</div><div class="text" id="p0460">The testis remains in apposition with the deep inguinal ring, held by the gubernaculum during postmenstrual weeks 13–24 (<a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Barteczko and Jacob 2000</a>). From postmenstrual week 35, the extracellular matrix of the gubernaculum is resorbed and it forms a fibrous attachment to the inside of the scrotum. Testis descent during the inguinoscrotal phase occurs relatively rapidly over postmenstrual weeks 25–28, the left testis usually descending ahead of the right.

The distal processus vaginalis (with visceral and parietal layers derived from the coelomic wall) persists as the tunica vaginalis, a satellite peritoneal cavity around the testis that becomes firmly attached to the surrounding scrotum within a few weeks. Obliteration of the proximal processus vaginalis is controlled by androgens, indirectly via CGRP released from the genitofemoral nerve.

This is a relatively common but transient state and usually resolves completely within a few weeks by further obliteration. The spermatic cord, scrotum, seminal glands and adjacent ampullae of the ductus deferens are all relatively large in the neonate, reflecting perinatal androgen exposure.</div><div class="text" id="p0475">In aberrant testicular descent, the testis may remain in the abdomen, although this is thought to be uncommon because the hormonal and morphological features of the transabdominal phase are relatively simple. By contrast, the indirect endocrine regulation and complex migratory process of the gubernaculum during the inguinoscrotal phase is frequently abnormal: the testis lies in the inguinal or pubic region in 2–5% of neonates. Rarely, the testis may lie in the perineum, in the upper part of the thigh or at the root of the penis. Causes may be deficient prenatal and postnatal androgens, a mislocated genitofemoral nerve or inadequate CGRP production from the nerve. Testes that have descended may not remain within the scrotum if the spermatic cord does not double its length between birth and puberty (<a href="#bib62" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Hutson 2013</a>).

Cryptorchidism used to be considered a relatively minor birth defect that was corrected surgically sometime during childhood. It is now considered to be a symptom of testicular dysgenesis syndrome, a spectrum that includes hypospadias, impaired semen quality and testicular germ cell cancer; it is associated with low birth weight; maternal smoking and gestational diabetes (<a href="#bib125" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_125">Toppari et al 2014</a>, <a href="#bib50" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Hadziselimovic 2017</a>). Since the number of spermatogonia decreases rapidly in undescended testes, orchidopexy is now undertaken between 6–9 months of postnatal life. Further delay results in impaired testicular catch-up growth in boys: even with early orchidopexy, men with bilateral undescended testes are six times more likely to be infertile (<a href="#bib82" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_82">Lee and Shortliffe 2014</a>). The finding that males with unilateral cryptorchidism are 25 times more likely to develop azoospermia than normal males supports the premise that this is a bilateral disease.

Like the testis, the ovary ultimately reaches a lower level than it occupies in the early months of fetal life, but it does not leave the pelvis to enter the inguinal canal, except in certain anomalies. The ovary is connected to the medial aspect of the mesonephric fold by the mesovarium (homologous with the mesorchium), and to the ventral abdominal wall by the inguinal fold (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 22.13</a>; <a href="#f0090"><span class="bold">Fig. 22.18</span></a>). A mesenchymatous gubernaculum develops in this fold but, as it traverses the mesonephric fold, it acquires an additional attachment to the lateral margin of the uterus near the entrance of the uterine tube. Its lower part, caudal to this uterine attachment, becomes the round ligament of the uterus, and the part cranial to the attachment becomes the ovarian ligament. Collectively, these structures are homologous with the gubernaculum testis in the male (<a href="#f0095"><span class="bold">Fig. 22.19</span></a>). This new uterine attachment may be correlated with the restricted ovarian descent. Initially, the ovary is attached to the medial side of the mesonephric fold but, in accordance with the manner in which the two mesonephric folds form the genital cord, it is finally connected to the posterior layer of the broad ligament of the uterus. The gubernacula thus develop in the female, unlike in the male, as bilateral fibrous bands or ligaments in the absence of INSL3. They do not extend into the labia majora, but end in the connective tissue just external to the external ring of the inguinal canal: in the absence of androgens, there is no migratory phase analogous to inguinoscrotal migration in the male. The saccus vaginalis is present in the female. Its prolongation into the inguinal canal (the canal of Nuck) is normally completely obliterated, but may remain patent and form the sac of a potential indirect inguinal hernia.</div><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="360" id="pagebreak_360"/></div><section><a id="sf0090"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0090"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000227/main.assets/f22-17-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0090"/><a id="fspara0090"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 22.18</span> The descent of the ovary. <span class="bold">A</span>, An early developing left ovary and uterine tube. <span class="bold">B</span>, The start of posterior movement of the ovary. <span class="bold">C</span>, The left ovary in its definitive posterior position. <span class="bold">D</span>, A sagittal section of the ligaments associated with the ovary, viewed from a left lateral position.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0095"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000227/main.assets/f22-18-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0095"/><a id="fspara0095"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 22.19</span> The development of the urogenital system from the indifferent stage to the definitive male and female states. <br/><span class="figcredit">Modified with permission from Williams PL, Wendell-Smith CP, Treadgold S 1969 Basic Human Embryology, 2nd ed.

The allantois, a blind-ending ventral diverticulum, passes into the connecting stalk of the early embryo prior to tail-folding and is drawn into the body cavity after stage 10. In subsequent stages the distal extension within the connecting stalk is termed the allantoic duct, and the proximal end that later passes into the forming umbilical cord is termed the urachus. The cloacal cavity is slightly dilated and lined with endoderm. It is initially connected dorsocranially to the enteric hindgut, ventrally to the allantois and ventrocaudally is in contact with overlying ectoderm at the cloacal membrane. It receives and contains fluid from the mesonephric kidneys until the cloacal membrane breaks down and the cloacal and amniotic cavities become confluent. Proliferation of mesenchyme at the angle of the junction of the hindgut and allantois produces the urorectal septum (intercloacal mesenchyme), which shows passive caudal expansion with embryonic growth, promoting the movement of the endodermal epithelium towards the cloacal membrane (<a href="#f0100"><span class="bold">Fig. 22.20</span></a>).

Cloacal malformations include the exstrophy–epispadias complex and the range of disorders of sex development; associated genital tract anomalies are common, with paramesonephric duct duplication in 40% of those affected (see <a href="#f0075">Fig. 22.15</a>) (<a href="#bib102" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_102">Rintala 2016</a>). The broad grouping of cloacal anomalies covers persistent urogenital sinus, anorectal malformations and ambiguous external genitalia. Persistent urogenital sinus is frequently seen with congenital adrenal hyperplasia; it can occur with normal and ambiguous external genitalia. The position of the resulting confluence of urethra and vagina relative to the bladder neck is important for future surgical management; one single common urogenital sinus channel opens on the perineum and anterior displacement of the anus may be seen. In persistent cloacal anomalies confluence of genital, urinary and intestinal paths form an isolated single perineal opening (<a href="#bib101" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Rink 2016</a>). Antenatal ultrasound findings of transient fetal ascites and decreased amniotic fluid have been noted from postmenstrual week 19 in cloacal anomalies, and are thought to be due to blocked urine outlet via the vagina (hydrocolpos) and secondary retrograde flow of urine through the uterus and uterine tubes to the peritoneal cavity. Hydronephrosis is common, related to the hydrocolpos and consequent compression of the bladder neck by the distended vagina (<a href="#bib101" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Rink 2016</a>).

The region of the early urethra remains open to form the vestibule, into which the definitive urethra and vagina open (see <a href="#f0100">Fig. 22.20</a>). It is thought that these regions are invaded by ectoderm because they are innervated by somatic nerves.</div><div class="text" id="p0535">The urethral sphincter first forms as a mesenchymal condensation around the urethra in stage 18 embryos, after division of the cloaca. The mesenchyme proliferates and becomes defined at the bladder neck after stage 23, and along the anterior part of the urethra by about postmenstrual week 13. The muscle fibres differentiate after postnatal week 15, at which time both smooth and striated fibres are present. In females, there is continuity between the smooth muscle of the bladder and urethral wall. In males, the muscle fibres are less abundant because of the local development of the prostate. Striated muscle fibres form around the smooth muscle, initially in the anterior wall of the urethra, and later encircle the smooth muscle layer. The striated muscle originates from ventral mass, lower limb myoblasts that, having entered the lower limb, then migrate to the perineal region.

Epispadias is a defect in the dorsal wall of the urethra on the glans of the penis, penile shaft, or at the junction of the penis with the ventral (anterior) abdominal wall. Isolated male epispadias is rare (1 in 117,000 males); this anomaly is considered to be a less severe form of exstrophy of the bladder (<a href="#bib47" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Gearhart and Mathews 2016</a>). Hypospadias is more common (1 in 250 births), with the urethral meatal opening anywhere along the line of fusion of the urogenital folds and scrotum. The incidence of hypospadias at distal sites along the penis is 94%, but also occurs in the midshaft (4%) and proximal shaft (1%). In more severe cases, the genital folds fail to fuse, and the urethra opens on the ventral aspect of a malformed penis just in front of the scrotum. The prevalence of hypospadias has increased and it is thought to be part of testicular dysgenesis syndrome. Congenital penile curvature (chordee), both dorsal or ventral, with an orthotopic meatus, is frequently associated with hypospadias and is thought to be linked to anomalous distribution of smooth muscle fibres in the dartos muscle.

The endodermal urogenital epithelium surrounding the developing urethra thickens and 14–20 solid buds arise around the whole circumference of the tube, mainly on its lateral aspects and excluding the dorsal wall above the utricular plate. The buds elongate and branch into the urogenital mesenchyme, showing some differentiation into luminal and basal cells as the lumen extends. They give rise to the outer glandular zone of the prostate. Later they will complete their secretory differentiation. Smooth muscle cells are seen in the urogenital mesenchyme at about postmenstrual week 20.</div><div class="text" id="p0555">In human fetuses the original entry point of the two mesonephric ducts and the (midline joined) paramesonephric ducts into the urogenital sinus produces a region of mixed epithelial derivation. An evagination of each mesonephric duct, now the ductus deferens, gives rise to the seminal glands, and thereafter it is the caudal continuation, the ejaculatory duct, that enters the developing urethra. In the embryo, the entry of the paramesonephric ducts into the urogenital sinus initiates the endodermal proliferation of the sinuvaginal bulb which will grow cranially as the vaginal plate in the female. The caudal-most remnants of the paramesonephric ducts, which involute under the effects of AMH in the male, remain as the prostatic utricle, a structure sometimes termed the male vagina (<a href="#bib96" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_96">Puppo and Puppo 2016</a>). These entry points produce an elongated dorsal prominence, the seminal colliculus (verumontanum).

Anomalous fusion and/or growth of the different tissue populations that meet at the verumontanum may result in protruberance of tissue into the urethra; the biomechanical effects of bladder filling and emptying might elongate this tissue, producing the sail-like fold(s) arising from the verumontanum that are seen in cases of posterior urethral valves.

Neural crest also arises from the tail-bud region, specifically from a population of cells termed the caudoneural hinge, which share the same molecular markers as the primitive node. The neural tube at this level is derived from a mesenchymal to epithelial transformation of caudoneural hinge cells that form a cylinder. Neural crest cells delaminate from the dorsal surface of the cylinder in a rostrocaudal direction. It is not known whether neuronal neural crest arising from secondary neurulation processes contributes to the caudal interface between endoderm and ectoderm.

From stage 13, primordia of the external genitalia, composed of underlying proliferating mesenchyme covered with ectoderm, arise around the cloacal membrane, between the primitive umbilical cord and the caudal limit of the embryo. During stage 15, the cloacal membrane is divided by the urorectal septum into a cranial urogenital membrane and a caudal anal membrane (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 22.4</a>). Local ectodermal–mesenchymal interactions give rise to the anal sphincter, which will develop even without the presence of the anal canal: the skeletal muscle is derived from a portion of the ventral muscle mass that initially migrates into the lower limb and then moves to the perineal region (<a href="#bib128" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Valasek et al 2005</a>, <a href="#bib99" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Rehimi et al 2010</a>). These myoblasts will give rise to the bulbospongiosus and ischiocavernosus muscles. A surface elevation, produced by underlying pericloacal mesenchyme, the genital tubercle, appears at the cranial end of the urogenital membrane and two lateral ridges, the genital or urethral folds, form each side of the membrane (<a href="#bib132" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Wang et al 2013</a>) (see <a href="#f0100">Fig. 22.20</a>). The genital tubercle forms a distinct primordium that will become the glans of either the penis or the clitoris. Elongation of the genital folds and urogenital membrane produces a primitive phallus. As this structure grows, it is described as having a cranial surface analogous to the dorsum of the penis, and a caudal surface analogous to the perineal surface in both sexes (<a href="#bib65" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_65">Isaacson et al 2018</a>). The urogenital sinus contiguous with the internal aspect of the urogenital membrane, becomes attenuated within the elongating phallus, forming the primitive urethra. The urogenital membrane breaks down at about stage 19, allowing communication of ectoderm and endoderm at the edges of the disrupted membrane and continuity of the urogenital sinus with the amniotic cavity. Urine can escape from the urinary tract from this time. The endodermal layer of the attenuated distal portion of the urogenital sinus, which is now displayed on the caudal aspect of the phallus, is termed the urethral plate (male) and vestibular plate (female).

The male phallus enlarges to form the penis. As mesenchyme proliferates within the genital folds, the urethral plate sinks into the body of the phallus, forming a primary urethral groove. The genital folds meet proximally in a transverse ridge immediately ventral to the anal membrane. The genital swellings meet each other ventral to the anus and unite to form the scrotum (see <a href="#f0100">Fig. 22.20</a>). The genital folds fuse with each other from behind forwards, enclosing the phallic part of the urogenital sinus behind to form the bulb of the urethra, and closing the definitive urethral groove in front to form the greater part of the spongiose urethra (<a href="#bib114" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_114">Shen et al 2016</a>). Fusion of the folds results in the formation of a median raphe and occurs in such a way that the lining of the postglandular urethra is formed by closure of the urethral groove. Thus, as the phallus lengthens, the urogenital orifice is carried onwards until it reaches the base of the glans at the apex of the penis. Within the glans the urethral plate canalizes directly to the urethral meatus. Expression of FOXA1, cytokeratin 7 and uroplakin confirm the entire endodermal origin of the human penile urethra (<a href="#bib141" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Liu et al 2018</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0595">The glans and shaft of the penis are recognizable by the end of the first trimester.

The ventral extremities of the ridge curve backwards to become continuous with the genital folds at the margins of the urethral orifice. As the urethral folds meet to form the terminal part of the urethra, the ventral horns of the ridge fuse to form the frenulum. The epithelial lamella breaks down over the dorsum and sides of the glans to form the preputial sac, and thus free the prepuce from the surface of the glans. Thereafter, the prepuce grows as a free fold of skin, which covers the terminal part of the glans. Although the prepuce and glans begin to separate from postmenstrual weeks 17–20, they may still be joined at birth. The preputial sac may not be complete until 6–12 postnatal months or more after birth and, even then, the presence of some connecting strands may still interfere with the retractability of the prepuce (<a href="#bib141" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Liu et al 2018</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0600">The mesenchymal core of the phallus is comparatively undifferentiated up to stage 17, with the blastemata of the corpora cavernosa <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="364" id="pagebreak_364"/><a id="pg364"/>becoming defined after stage 23.

They secrete inhibin B that peaks at postnatal months 3–6 and remains elevated until postnatal month 15. Secretion of AMH is highest at postnatal month 3 and then declines to remain stable in childhood until puberty, when it declines to adult levels (3–4% of infant level). The number of Leydig cells increases until postnatal month 3 and then decreases.</div><div class="text" id="p0655">In females, the labia minora, clitoris and labia majora are relatively enlarged, reflecting the effects of placental oestrogens. Levels of oestradiol increase after the first postnatal week and remain high up to 6 postnatal months, with fluctuations in the first months. During this time, some ovarian follicles mature to antral stages and some atrophy. Further development of the follicles produces a marked rise in AMH levels, secreted by granulosa cells, at postnatal month 3. The pool of primordial follicles remains stable until postnatal month 8 at which time the majority undergo atresia. The remaining follicles resume development after puberty, completing oocyte first meiotic division shortly before ovulation. The granulosa cells at this time enlarge and multiply to form the stratum granulosum; they are surrounded by thecal cells that differentiate from the stroma.</div><div class="text" id="p0660">Most term neonates of both sexes have palpable breast tissue, larger and persisting longer in females, that reflects the high level of oestradiol in cord blood. Mammary gland diameter gradually decreases in both sexes, until postnatal month 6 in boys and over a longer time in girls, reflecting endogenous oestrogen activity (<a href="#f0115">Fig. 22.22</a>). Uterine length increases primarily during pregnancy under the influence of the hormones that cross the placental barrier. It is relatively longest at day 7 in full-term babies, then steadily involutes towards postnatal month 3, remains fairly unchanged until the second year, and does not regain its neonatal size and weight until puberty. In males, the penis and scrotum are relatively large; penile length, which is correlated with serum testosterone level, increases from birth to 3 years of age, with the highest growth velocity between birth and postnatal month 3. Testicular volume increases from birth to postnatal months 5–6, reflecting the proliferation of Sertoli cells, and then decreases from about postnatal month 9. It has been suggested that transient activation of the HPG axis causes early germ cells to differentiate into adult dark (Ad) spermatogonia, the future adult reservoir of stem cells, from postnatal month 3 (<a href="#bib50" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Hadziselimovic 2017</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0665">In preterm babies the postnatal HPG axis activation is stronger and more prolonged than in full-term babies. In males, the testosterone levels are higher, with a significant difference to full-term babies at postnatal month 6. Preterm males have faster penile and testicular growth. In females the levels LH and FSH are higher, the FSH level possibly reflecting less ovarian follicle development. Antral follicles can be seen postnatally and there are increases in AMH and oestradiol from granulosa cells. The intensity of postnatal hormonal stimulation in preterm babies can cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, which is self-limiting. In neonates with fetal growth restriction, males show reduced testicular volume and testosterone concentration in adult life, leading to infertility; females show adrenal and ovarian hyperandrogenism, with precocious pubarche and reduced ovulation rate, associated with lower insulin sensitivity (<a href="#bib80" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Lanciotti et al 2018</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0670">Puberty is the term given to describe the time at which changes in HPG axis, gonads, reproductive organs and secondary sexual characteristics occur, along with the adolescent growth spurt (<a href="../B9780702077050000239/B9780702077050000239.xhtml">Ch. 23</a>). The sequence of events, which is much less variable than the age at which they take place, is shown in <a href="#f0120"><span class="bold">Fig. 22.23</span></a>. Normal puberty can be regarded as a process of innate maturation that can be modified by nutrition and stress. There is a secular trend toward early puberty in many developed and developing countries linked to the secular trend of greater adult height: faster growth in childhood/juvenile phases is associated with earlier age at puberty. The earliest change associated with puberty is the onset of sleep-related LH pulses that occur earlier in girls than boys; rising oestradiol levels reflect primary follicle recruitment in girls; rising testosterone levels in boys reflect increasing Leydig cell activity and proliferation of Sertoli cells (<a href="#bib45" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_45">Ellison and Reiches 2012</a>). Chondrocyte proliferation is stimulated in the growth plates of growing bones (<a href="#bib67" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_67">Jee and Baron 2016</a>). Androgen secretion by the suprarenal gland stimulates growth of pubic and axillary hair in both sexes, appearing earlier in girls. Body composition changes as a consequence of gonadal steroid production; oestradiol stimulates adipose tissue growth in girls particularly in the breasts and gluteofemoral region, whereas in boys, testosterone inhibits adipose tissue growth and stimulates muscle anabolism (<a href="#bib45" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Ellison and Reiches 2012</a>).</div><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0120"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000227/main.assets/on22-03-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0125"/><a id="fspara0120"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 22.23</span> The average ages at which maturation events occur in adolescent girls and boys.

Sports and excessive restriction of diet, both of which may reduce weight below this level, can cause amenorrhoea in females who were previously menstruating normally. Tall girls reach sexual maturity earlier than short ones, but girls with a late adolescent growth spurt and later puberty are ultimately taller on the average than those who pass through the menarche early.
