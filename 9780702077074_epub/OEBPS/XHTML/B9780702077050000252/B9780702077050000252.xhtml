The individual layers, from outside to inside, are the dura mater (pachymeninx), arachnoid mater and pia mater. The dura is an opaque, tough, fibrous coat that incompletely divides the cranial cavity into compartments and accommodates the dural venous sinuses. The arachnoid is much thinner than the dura and is mostly translucent. It loosely surrounds the brain, cranial nerves and vessels and spans fissures and sulci. The pia mater is a transparent, microscopically thin membrane that follows the contours of the brain and is closely adherent to its surface.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">The dura is separated from the arachnoid by a narrow subdural space. The arachnoid is separated from the pia by the subarachnoid space, which varies greatly in depth; the larger expanses are termed subarachnoid cisterns. The subarachnoid space contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which is secreted by the choroid plexuses of the cerebroventricular system, circulates within the subarachnoid space and is reabsorbed into the venous system through arachnoid villi associated with the dural venous sinuses.</div><div class="text" id="p0020">Cranial and spinal meninges are continuous through the foramen magnum. The cranial meninges are described in this section and the spinal meninges are described in <a href="../B9780702077050000471/B9780702077050000471.xhtml">Chapter 47</a>.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Dura Mater</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0025">The dura mater is largely acellular and consists mainly of densely packed fascicles of collagen fibres arranged in laminae. The fascicles run in different directions in adjacent laminae, producing a lattice-like appearance that is particularly obvious in the tentorium cerebelli and around the defects or perforations that sometimes occur in the anterior portion of the falx cerebri.</div><div class="text" id="p0030">The cranial dura differs from the spinal dura mainly in its relationship to the surrounding bones. It lines the cranial cavity and has an inner, meningeal, layer and an outer, endosteal layer. The two membranes are physically joined only at sites where veins pass from the brain into venous sinuses, e.g. the superior sagittal sinus. There is little histological difference between the layers: both contain fibroblasts, and the endosteal layer also contains osteoblasts. Focal calcification may occur in the falx cerebri and near the superior sagittal sinus. As a general rule, the meningeal layer covers neural tissues. It provides tubular sheaths for the cranial nerves as they pass out through the cranial foramina: the sheaths fuse with the epineurium as the nerves emerge from the skull. The dura fuses with the adventitia of major vessels, such as the internal carotid and vertebral arteries, at sites where they pierce it to enter the cranial cavity. The dural sheath of the optic nerve is continuous with the ocular sclera. The endosteal layer of dura adheres to the internal surfaces of the cranial bones, particularly at the sutures and the cranial base, and around the foramen magnum. It is continuous with the pericranium through the cranial sutures and foramina and with the orbital periosteum through the superior orbital fissure. Fibrous bands pass from the dura into the bones, so that it is difficult to remove the dura from the suture lines in young skulls: as the suture lines fuse, the dura becomes separated from them. The meningeal layer of dura is closely applied to the arachnoid mater over the surface of the brain: the layers are united except where they separate to enclose the venous sinuses that drain blood from the brain.</div><section><a id="s0015"/><section><a id="s0020"/><h3 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0025">Extradural haematoma</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0035">The anatomical organization of the dura, and its relationships to the major venous sinuses, sutures and blood vessels, are clinically important. Separation of the dura from the cranial bones requires significant force, and consequently happens when high-pressure arterial bleeding takes place into the extradural or epidural space: this can result from damage to any meningeal vessel, commonly following skull fracture. The classic site for such injury is along the course of the middle meningeal artery, where a direct blow causing a fracture of the temporal and/or parietal bones can rupture the artery and cause rapid collection of blood into the extradural space. An extradural haematoma therefore acts as a rapidly expanding intracranial mass lesion that causes acute brain compression and displacement: it is a classic medical emergency that requires immediate diagnosis and surgery through a craniotomy for epidural blood clot evacuation and coagulation of the ruptured vessel (<a href="#f0120"><span class="bold">Fig. 25.1</span></a>).</div><div id="p0040"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0120"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000252/main.assets/on25-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0120"/><a id="fspara0120"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 25.1</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, A head CT scan showing a right-sided extradural (epidural) haematoma.

The crescent is narrow anteriorly, where the falx is fixed to the crista galli, and broad posteriorly, where it blends with the tentorium cerebelli: the straight sinus runs along this line of attachment to the tentorium (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 25.2</a>). The anterior part of the falx is thin and may have a number of irregular perforations. Its convex upper margin is attached to the internal cranial surface on each side of the midline, as far posteriorly as the internal occipital protuberance. The superior sagittal sinus runs in a cranial groove within the dura along this margin, and the falx cerebri is attached to the lips of this groove. The lower edge of the falx is free and concave, and contains the inferior sagittal sinus.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000252/main.assets/f25-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 25.2</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, The cerebral dura mater, its reflections and associated major venous sinuses. <span class="bold">B</span>, An anatomical dissection of a silicon-injected specimen. <br/><span class="figcredit">A, Adapted with permission from Drake RL, Vogl AW, Mitchell A (eds) Gray’s Anatomy for Students, 2nd ed.

Its base is directed upwards and is attached to the posterior part of the inferior surface of the tentorium cerebelli in the midline. Its posterior margin contains the occipital sinus and is attached to the internal occipital crest. The lower apex of the falx cerebelli frequently divides into two small folds that disappear at the sides of the foramen magnum.</div></section><section><a id="s0050"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0045">Diaphragma sellae</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0060">The diaphragma sellae is a small, circular, horizontal sheet of dura mater that forms a roof over the sella turcica and covers the pituitary gland (hypophysis). The infundibulum (pituitary stalk) passes into the pituitary fossa through a central opening in the diaphragm: there is wide individual variation in the size of this opening. The diaphragma sellae is an important landmark in pituitary surgery because large pituitary tumours extend above it and may adopt a characteristic dumbbell shape. A trans-sphenoidal approach is currently the preferred option for accessing pituitary tumours, irrespective of whether there is suprasellar extension beyond the diaphragma sellae.</div></section><section><a id="s0055"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0050">Tentorium cerebelli</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0065">The shape of the tentorium cerebelli (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 25.2B</a>) is reminiscent of a single-poled tent, as its name suggest. It lies between the cerebellum and the occipital lobes of the cerebral hemispheres, and divides the cranial cavity into supratentorial and infratentorial compartments that contain the forebrain and hindbrain, respectively. Its concave anterior edge is free and separated from the dorsum sellae of the sphenoid bone by a large curved hiatus, the tentorial incisure or notch, which is occupied by the midbrain and the anterior part of the superior aspect of the cerebellar vermis. The convex outer limit of the tentorium is attached posteriorly to the lips of the transverse sulci of the occipital bone and <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="399" id="pagebreak_399"/><a id="pg398.e1"/>to the posterior inferior angles of the parietal bones, where it encloses the transverse sinuses. Laterally, it is attached to the superior borders of the petrous parts of the temporal bones, where it contains the superior petrosal sinuses. On each side, near the apex of the petrous temporal bone, the lower layer of the tentorium is evaginated anterolaterally under the superior petrosal sinus to form a recess, Meckel’s cave, between the endosteal and meningeal dural layers in the middle cranial fossa. The cave is entered by the posterior root of the trigeminal nerve and contains cerebrospinal fluid and the trigeminal ganglion; the evaginated meningeal layer fuses anteriorly with the anterior part of the ganglion.</div><div class="text" id="p0070">The arrangement of the dura mater in the central part of the middle cranial fossa is complex. The tentorium forms the medial part of the floor of the middle cranial fossa. On both sides, the rim of the tentorial incisure is attached to the apex of the petrous temporal bone. It continues forwards as a ridge of dura, the anterior petroclinoidal ligament, that is attached to the anterior clinoid process: this ligament marks the junction of the roof and the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. The periphery of the tentorium cerebelli (attached to the superior border of the petrous temporal bone), crosses under the free border of the tentorial incisure at the apex of the petrous temporal bone, and continues forwards to the posterior clinoid process as a rounded ridge of dura mater, the posterior petroclinoidal ligament. The dural extension between the anterior and posterior petroclinoidal ligaments forms the roof of the cavernous sinus. On either side, it is pierced superiorly by the oculomotor nerve and posteriorly by the trochlear nerve: both nerves proceed anteroinferiorly into the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus.</div><div class="text" id="p0075">In the anteromedial part of the middle cranial fossa, the dura ascends as the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. It reaches the ridge produced by the anterior petroclinoidal ligament and runs medially as the roof of the cavernous sinus, where it is pierced by the internal carotid artery. The interclinoidal ligament, between the anterior and posterior clinoid processes, forms the medial limit of the roof of the cavernous sinus and continues medially with the diaphragma sellae. At, or just below, the opening in the diaphragma for the pituitary stalk, the dura of the diaphragma and the suprasellar arachnoid blend with each other and with the capsule of the pituitary gland: the subarachnoid space does not extend into the sella turcica.</div><section><a id="s0060"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0055">Transtentorial coning</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0080">Normally, the arrangement of dural partitions such as the falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli may help to stabilize the brain within the cranial cavity. However, when there is focal brain swelling or a focal space-occupying lesion within the brain or cranial cavity, mass effect and raised intracranial pressure may cause the brain to herniate under the falx cerebri or, more significantly, through the tentorial incisure. In this case, the medial temporal lobe, and particularly the uncus, will compress the oculomotor nerve, midbrain and the posterior cerebral arteries. This life-threatening event and neurosurgical emergency, occurring in patients with supratentorial space-occupying lesions, is known as transtentorial uncal herniation. Similarly, space-occupying lesions in the smaller infratentorial compartment may cause upward herniation of the cerebellar vermis through the tentorial hiatus (upward transtentorial herniation) or downward herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum (tonsillar herniation) (see <a href="../B9780702077050000288/B9780702077050000288.xhtml#f0110">Fig. 28.23</a>); these neurosurgical emergencies require a suboccipital craniectomy.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0070"/><section><a id="s0075"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0060">Innervation of the cranial dura mater</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0085">The cranial dura mater is innervated mainly by branches of the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve, the second and third cervical spinal nerves and the cervical sympathetic trunk (<a href="#f0015"><span class="bold">Fig. 25.3</span></a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000252/main.assets/f25-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000252/main.assets/on25-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 25.3</span> The innervation of the cranial meninges. <span class="bold">B</span>, The innervation of the cranial meninges.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0090">Less well established meningeal branches have been described arising from the vagus and hypoglossal nerves, and possibly from the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves.</div><div class="text" id="p0095">In the anterior cranial fossa, the dura is innervated by meningeal branches of the anterior and posterior ethmoidal nerves and anterior filaments of the meningeal rami of the maxillary (nervus meningeus medius) and mandibular (nervus spinosus) divisions of the trigeminal nerve. Nervi meningeus medius and spinosus are largely distributed to the dura of the middle cranial fossa, which also receives filaments from the trigeminal ganglion. The nervus spinosus re-enters the cranium through the foramen spinosum with the middle meningeal artery, and divides into anterior and posterior branches that accompany the main divisions of the artery and supply the dura mater in the middle cranial fossa and, to a lesser extent, the anterior fossa and calvarium. The anterior branch communicates with the meningeal branch of the maxillary nerve. The posterior branch also supplies the mucous lining of the mastoid air cells. The nervus spinosus contains sympathetic postganglionic fibres from the middle meningeal plexus. The nervus tentorii, a recurrent branch of the intracranial portion of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, supplies the supratentorial falx cerebri and the tentorium cerebelli. Intraoperative mechanical stimulation of the falx may trigger the trigeminocardiac reflex (<a href="#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">Bauer et al 2005</a>). The space between the anterior half of the straight sinus and the medial tentorial notch can be considered a safe surgical area where innervation is scarce, whereas the entire region of the transverse sinus and the posterior half of the straight sinus are densely innervated by the nervus tentorii (<a href="#bib49" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_49">Lee et al 2017</a>). The dura in the posterior cranial fossa is innervated by ascending meningeal branches of the upper cervical nerves that enter through the anterior part of the foramen magnum (second and third cervical nerves) and through the hypoglossal canal and jugular foramen (first and second cervical nerves).</div><div class="text" id="p0100">Meningeal branches from the vagus nerve apparently originate from the superior vagal ganglion and are distributed to the dura mater in the posterior cranial fossa. Meningeal branches from the hypoglossal nerve leave the nerve in its canal and supply the diploë of the occipital bone, the dural walls of the occipital and inferior petrosal sinuses, and much of the floor and anterior wall of the posterior cranial fossa. These meningeal rami may not contain vagal or hypoglossal fibres but ascending, mixed sensory and sympathetic fibres from the upper cervical nerves and superior cervical sympathetic ganglion. All meningeal nerves contain a postganglionic sympathetic component, either from the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion or by communication with its perivascular intracranial extensions. The role of the autonomic nerve supply of the cranial dura mater is uncertain.</div><div class="text" id="p0105">Sensory nerve endings are restricted to the dura mater and cerebral blood vessels, and are not found in either the brain itself, or in the arachnoid or pia mater. Stimulation of these nerve endings causes pain, as evidenced during awake craniotomy procedures, and is the basis of certain forms of headache. The density of dural innervation, particularly around the dural venous sinuses, increases during the later part of gestation, peaking at term and subsequently decreasing during the first year of postnatal life (<a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_31">Davidson et al 2012</a>).</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0085"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0065">Dural venous sinuses</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0110">Dural venous sinuses form a complex network of venous channels that drain blood from the brain and cranial bones (<a href="#f0125"><span class="bold">Fig. 25.4</span></a>; see <a href="#f0010">Figs 25.2</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000264/B9780702077050000264.xhtml#f0055">26.10</a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000264/B9780702077050000264.xhtml#f0060">26.11</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000264/B9780702077050000264.xhtml#f0070">26.13</a>).

They develop initially as venous plexuses and, to a variable degree, most adult sinuses retain that form. Plexiform arrays of small veins adjoin the superior and inferior sagittal and straight sinuses, and, less frequently, the transverse sinuses.

These variations must be established for each patient by catheter-based angiography, magnetic resonance (MR) venography or computed tomographic (CT) venography, when clinical necessity arises. The existence of arteriovenous shunts has been inferred from the demonstration of a connection between the middle meningeal arteries and the superior sagittal sinus (<a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Browder and Kaplan 1976</a>). Dural arteriovenous fistulae are thought to be acquired lesions that form in an area of thrombosis within a sinus. If the sinus remains completely thrombosed, venous drainage from these lesions takes place through cortical veins: when the sinus remains closed, the elevated pressure within the cortical veins receiving the arterial flow carries the risk of haemorrhage.

The lacunae mainly drain diploic and meningeal veins. The cortical veins typically pass beneath the lacunae on their way to the sinus. The superior anastomotic vein (of Trolard), the largest cortical vein that connects the superficial middle cerebral (Sylvian) vein and the superior sagittal sinus, often runs in the precentral, central or postcentral sulci.

The cavity of the cavernous sinus is formed when the two layers of dura that cover the anterior aspect of the pituitary gland separate from each other at the lateral margin of the sella: the outer (endosteal) layer continues laterally to form the anterior (sphenoidal) wall of the cavernous sinus, and the inner (meningeal) layer remains attached to the pituitary gland and runs back towards the dorsum sellae to form the medial (sellar) wall of the cavernous sinus. The posterior dural wall is posterior to the dorsum sellae and upper clivus, and is shared with the basilar plexus. The lateral wall extends from the superior orbital fissure to the petrous apex, and separates the cavernous sinus from Meckel’s cave, which is inferior and posterior to the sinus. The roof of the cavernous sinus is formed by the clinoidal triangle (the dura lining the lower margin of the anterior clinoid process anteriorly), and the oculomotor triangle (the patch of dura between the anterior and posterior clinoids and the petrous apex).</div><div class="text" id="p0180">Each sinus contains the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery which is associated with a perivascular sympathetic plexus. From proximal to distal, the cavernous carotid artery has several portions, named short ascending, posterior genu, horizontal and anterior genu. The anterior genu of the cavernous carotid artery continues as the paraclinoidal segment of the carotid artery, which typically protrudes into the cavity of the sphenoidal sinus. The cavernous carotid gives off two major arterial branches: the meningohypophysial and inferolateral trunks (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 25.9B</a>). The meningohypophysial trunk typically arises from the posterior genu and gives off the inferior hypophysial, tentorial and dorsal meningeal arteries. The inferolateral trunk arises a few millimetres distal to the meningohypophysial and is distributed around the nerves on the lateral wall of the sinus. (For more detailed descriptions of these branches, including their main variations, see <a href="#bib47" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_47">Krisht et al (1994)</a>, <a href="#bib63" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_63">Reisch et al (1996)</a>, <a href="#bib70" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_70">Tekdemir et al (1998)</a>.)</div><div class="text" id="p0185">Several cranial nerves run forwards through the cavernous sinus to enter the orbit via the superior orbital fissure (see <a href="#f0040">Fig. 25.9</a>). The oculomotor and trochlear nerves and the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve all lie in the lateral wall of the sinus. The abducens nerve enters the cavernous sinus by passing inferior to the petrosphenoidal ligament within a dural tunnel (Dorello’s canal) just posterior to the short ascending portion of the cavernous carotid artery, and then runs on the inferolateral side of the horizontal portion of the cavernous carotid artery, just medial to the ophthalmic nerve. The space between the trochlear and ophthalmic nerves at the lateral wall of the sinus, known as the infratrochlear or Parkinson’s triangle, gives access to the horizontal and posterior genu portions of the cavernous carotid and the meningohypophysial trunk, and the abducens nerve. Unlike the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve does not run through the cavernous sinus or its lateral wall, but courses beneath the dura of the middle cranial fossa below the level of the cavernous sinus (<a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_26">Abhinav et al 2017</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0190">Several major venous spaces or compartments can be identified within the sinus in relation to the cavernous carotid artery: superior, posterior, inferior and lateral (<a href="#bib39" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_39">Fernandez-Miranda et al 2017</a>, modified from <a href="#bib40" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_40">Harris and Rhoton 1976</a>).

Hypo- or hyperaesthesia in the distribution of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve and a decreased corneal reflex may also be detected. There may be evidence of dilated, tortuous retinal veins and papilloedema. These changes can cause permanent blindness.

When these connections are well developed, the sphenoparietal sinus is a large channel.

A mastoid emissary vein in the mastoid foramen connects the sigmoid sinus with the posterior auricular or occipital veins. A parietal emissary vein in the parietal foramen connects the superior sagittal sinus with the veins of the scalp. The venous plexus of the hypoglossal canal (occasionally a single vein) connects the sigmoid sinus and the internal jugular vein. A supracondylar emissary vein connects the sigmoid sinus and veins in the suboccipital triangle via the posterior condylar canal. A plexus of emissary veins (venous plexus of the foramen ovale) connects the cavernous sinus to the pterygoid plexus via the foramen ovale. Two or three small veins traverse the foramen lacerum and connect the cavernous sinus and the pharyngeal veins and pterygoid plexus. A vein in the emissary sphenoidal foramen (of Vesalius) connects the cavernous sinus with the pharyngeal veins and pterygoid plexus. The internal carotid venous plexus, which passes through the carotid canal, connects the cavernous sinus and the internal jugular vein. A vein may traverse the foramen caecum and connect nasal veins with the superior sagittal sinus. An occipital emissary vein usually connects the confluence of the sinuses with the occipital vein through the occipital protuberance, and also receives the occipital diploic vein. The occipital sinus connects with variably developed veins around the foramen magnum (marginal sinuses) and thus with the vertebral venous plexuses; this pathway provides an alternative venous drainage when the jugular vein is blocked or tied. The ophthalmic veins are potentially emissary because they connect intracranial and extracranial veins. The petrosquamous sinus arises from the dorsolateral portion of the transverse sinus before its confluence with the superior petrosal sinus, courses over the lateral superior surface of the petrous part of the temporal bone, and drains anteroinferiorly into the retromandibular vein and anteromedially into the pterygoid venous plexus.

The anatomy of the meningeal arteries explains the vascular supply of tumours arising from the meninges (meningiomas) and the architecture of dural arteriovenous fistulae and malformations.

It arises from the first part of the maxillary artery in the infratemporal fossa and passes between the roots of the auriculotemporal nerve. It lies lateral to tensor veli palatini, then enters the cranial cavity through the foramen spinosum and runs in an anterolateral groove on the squamous part of the temporal bone, dividing into frontal and parietal branches (see <a href="#f0045">Fig. 25.10A</a>). The larger frontal (anterior) branch crosses the greater wing of the sphenoid and enters a groove or canal in the sphenoidal angle of the parietal bone (the sphenoparietal canal). It divides into branches between the dura mater and cranium, and some branches ascend to the vertex. The parietal (posterior) branch curves back on the squamous temporal bone, reaches the lower border of the parietal bone anterior to its mastoid angle and divides to supply the posterior parts of the dura mater and cranium. These frontal and parietal branches anastomose with their fellows and with the anterior and posterior meningeal arteries.</div><div class="text" id="p0260">Ganglionic branches supply the trigeminal ganglion and associated roots. The petrosal branch enters the hiatus for the greater petrosal nerve, supplies the facial nerve, geniculate ganglion and tympanic cavity, and anastomoses with the stylomastoid artery (<a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">El Khouly et al 2008</a>). The superior tympanic artery runs in the canal for tensor tympani and supplies the muscle and the mucosa that lines the canal. Temporal branches traverse minute foramina in the greater wing of the sphenoid and anastomose with deep temporal arteries that supply temporalis. An anastomotic branch enters the orbit laterally in the superior orbital fissure, and anastomoses with a recurrent branch of the lacrimal artery; enlargement of this anastomosis is believed to account for the occasional origin of the lacrimal artery from the middle meningeal artery.</div></section><section><a id="s0190"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0155">Accessory meningeal artery</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0270">The accessory meningeal artery may arise from the maxillary artery or the middle meningeal artery.

Its main distribution is extracranial, principally to medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid (upper head), tensor veli palatini, the greater wing and pterygoid processes of the sphenoid bone, the mandibular nerve and the otic ganglion.

The vein subsequently passes cranially along the anterior margin of the parietal squama to empty into the venous lakes of the superior sagittal sinus. As they course under the most lateral aspect of the lesser sphenoidal wing, the anterior branches of the middle meningeal vessels are contained for a short distance within a bony canal, the sphenoparietal canal (of Trolard), which they leave to enter a groove on the internal surface of the parietal squama. The veins lie closer to the bone than the artery, sometimes occupying separate grooves, and are particularly liable to tear in cranial fractures. Before it enters the sphenoparietal canal, the anterior branch of the middle meningeal vein usually connects with the sinus of the lesser sphenoidal wing, which is connected medially with the anterior and superior aspect of the cavernous sinus by a channel that crosses over the superior ophthalmic vein to reach the sinus. The parietal (posterior) trunk of the middle meningeal vein may traverse the foramen spinosum to end in the pterygoid venous plexus.

They are separated by the subarachnoid space and joined by trabeculae. The outer layer of the arachnoid, the dura–arachnoid interface, is formed from five or six layers of cells joined by numerous desmosomes and tight junctions and forms a barrier that normally prevents permeation of CSF through the arachnoid into the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="406" id="pagebreak_406"/><a id="pg406"/>subdural space. The central portion of the arachnoid is closely apposed to the outer layer, and is formed from tightly packed polygonal cells joined by desmosomes and gap junctions. The cells are more loosely packed in the inner layer of the arachnoid, where they intermingle with bundles of collagen continuous with the trabeculae that cross the subarachnoid space. The leptomeningeal cells are not surrounded by basement membrane, except where they are in contact with collagen in the inner layers of the arachnoid and on the deep aspects of the pia mater.</div><div class="text" id="p0305">The anatomical relationships of the arachnoid and pia differ to some extent in the cerebral and spinal regions. The cerebral part of the arachnoid mater invests the brain loosely: it does not enter the sulci or fissures, other than the interhemispheric and Sylvian fissures, and it coats the superior surface of the pituitary fossa. The arachnoid is easily separated from the dura over the surface of the brain, but it is adherent to the adventitia of the internal carotid and the vertebral arteries where they enter the subarachnoid space. It is reflected onto the surface of blood vessels and cranial nerves in the subarachnoid space: this is the basis for microsurgical subarachnoid dissection to expose brain vessels and cranial nerves. The subarachnoid cisterns are cavities formed by the wide separation of the pia and arachnoid, which is particularly common on the basal aspect of the brain, where the basal cisterns are located. Knowledge of the neural and vascular contents of each of the basal cisterns is of particular value to the neurosurgeon in the planning and execution of intracranial procedures (<a href="#bib73" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_73">Yasargil 1984</a>).</div><section><a id="s0225"/><section><a id="s0230"/><h3 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0185">Subdural haematoma</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0310">Separation of the arachnoid and dura mater requires little physical force, which means that damage to small bridging veins in the space can result in a subdural haematoma after even relatively mild head trauma. In cases of chronic or subacute subdural haematomas, the accumulation is of relatively low pressure and seldom presents as a medical emergency; even sizeable accumulations may be tolerated on a chronic basis with mild or no symptoms, and can be surgically drained through small openings in the skull (burr-holes). In many cases, there is some predisposing factor, such as cerebral atrophy or an increase in the size of the underlying subarachnoid space. In cases of acute subdural haematoma, typically after severe head trauma, there is rapid accumulation of blood in the subdural space which requires emergency neurosurgical drainage through a large craniotomy or craniectomy. The distinction between subdural and extradural haematoma on a CT scan relies on the anatomical features of the clot. Extradural collections tend to be lentiform in shape, reflecting the pressure required to separate the dura and periosteum: they will not pass deep to any major dural sinus and cannot extend along the falx cerebri or tentorium cerebelli. In contrast, acute subdural haematomas tend to be biconcave in shape and often follow the line of the dura along the falx or tentorium (see <a href="#f0120">Fig. 25.1</a>).</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0235"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0190">Topography and Relationships of the Ventricular System</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0315">The cerebral ventricular system consists of a series of interconnecting spaces and channels within the brain (<a href="#f0050"><span class="bold">Figs 25.11</span></a>–<a href="#f0130"><span class="bold">25.12</span></a>), which are derived from the central lumen of the embryonic neural tube and the cerebral vesicles to which it gives rise (<a href="../B9780702077050000148/B9780702077050000148.xhtml">Ch. 14</a>).

It consists largely of grey matter and contains important cranial nerve nuclei (V–XII). The precise location of some nuclei is discernible from surface features. The floor of the ventricle can be divided into a superior and inferior part: both parts are triangular in shape and are separated by the striae medullares, which have a horizontal course across the floor of the ventricle. The superior triangle is limited laterally by the superior cerebellar peduncles as they converge towards the cerebral aqueduct; its apex is directed superiorly, towards the aqueduct. The inferior triangle is bounded caudally by the gracile and cuneate tubercles, which contain the dorsal column nuclei, and, more rostrally, by the diverging inferior cerebellar peduncles. The apex of the inferior triangle is known as the obex. A longitudinal median sulcus divides the floor of the fourth ventricle into two halves. Each half is itself divided, by an often indistinct sulcus limitans, into a medial region, the medial eminence, and a lateral region, the vestibular area. The vestibular nuclei lie beneath the vestibular area. In the superior part, the medial eminence is represented by the facial colliculus, a small elevation produced by an underlying loop of efferent fibres from the facial nucleus that covers the abducens nucleus. Between the facial colliculus and the vestibular area the sulcus limitans widens into a small depression, the superior fovea. In its upper part, the sulcus limitans constitutes the lateral limit of the floor of the fourth ventricle. Here, a small region of bluish-grey pigmentation denotes the presence of the subjacent locus coeruleus. Caudal to the facial colliculus, at the level of the lateral recess of the ventricle, a variable group of nerve fibre fascicles, the striae medullares, runs transversely across the ventricular floor and passes into the median sulcus. In the inferior part, the medial eminence is represented by the hypoglossal triangle (trigone), which lies over the hypoglossal nucleus. Laterally, the sulcus limitans widens to produce an indistinct inferior fovea. Caudal to the inferior fovea, between the hypoglossal triangle and the vestibular area, the vagal triangle (trigone) covers the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. A narrow translucent ridge, the funiculus separans, separated from the gracile tubercle by the small area postrema, crosses below the vagal triangle.</div><div class="text" id="p0410">The roof of the fourth ventricle is formed by the superior and inferior medullary veli.

Dorsally, it is covered by the lingula of the superior vermis. The inferior medullary velum is more complex and is mostly composed of a thin sheet, devoid of neural tissue, formed by ventricular ependyma and the pia mater of the tela choroidea. Just inferior to the nodule of the cerebellum, a median aperture, the foramen of Magendie, opens the roof of the fourth ventricle into the cisterna magna.

The cistern is continuous above with the lumen of the fourth ventricle through its median aperture (foramen of Magendie) and below with the spinal subarachnoid space. It contains the vertebral arteries and the origins of the posterior inferior cerebellar arteries, the glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory and hypoglossal nerves, and the choroid plexus.</div><div class="text" id="p0535">On either side, the paired cerebellopontine cisterns (angle cisterns or cerebellopontine angle cisterns) are situated in the lateral angle between the cerebellum and the pons. They are traversed by the trigeminal, facial and vestibulocochlear nerves, the anterior inferior cerebellar arteries and the superior petrosal veins.</div><div class="text" id="p0540">The prepontine cistern (pontine cistern) is an extensive space ventral to the pons, which is continuous inferiorly with the spinal subarachnoid space, posteriorly and laterally with the cerebellopontine cisterns, and rostrally with the interpeduncular cistern. The prepontine cistern contains the origin of the abducens nerve and the basilar artery and its two main branches, the anterior inferior cerebellar and superior cerebellar arteries. The quadrigeminal cistern (superior cistern, vein of Galen cistern, peripineal cistern) lies posterior to the brainstem and third ventricle, and occupies the interval between the splenium of the corpus callosum and the superior cerebellar surface. The great cerebral vein, formed by the union of the basal veins (of Rosenthal) and the internal cerebral veins, traverses this cistern and the pineal gland protrudes into it. It also contains the P3 segments of the posterior cerebral arteries and portions of the medial and lateral posterior choroidal arteries.</div><div class="text" id="p0545">The paired ambient cisterns are extensions of the quadrigeminal cistern. On each side, they lie between the parahippocampal and dentate gyri of the temporal lobes laterally and the lateral surface of the midbrain behind the cerebral peduncles medially; they therefore extend laterally and anteriorly around the midbrain on either side to the interpeduncular cistern (basal cistern) (see <a href="#f0135">Fig. 25.26</a>). They are divided into supra- and infra-tentorial compartments and contain the basal vein (of Rosenthal), the P2P segment of the posterior cerebral artery, the superior cerebellar artery and the trochlear nerves.</div><div class="text" id="p0550">The paired crural cisterns lie between the posterior borders of the unci and the cerebral peduncles on each side and contain the P2A segments of the posterior cerebral artery and the postoptic part of the anterior choroidal artery. The midline interpeduncular cistern (basal cistern) lies between the two crura cerebri, bordered superiorly and inferiorly by the diencephalic and mesencephalic leaves respectively of Liliequist’s membrane. It contains the basilar artery, the origins of the posterior cerebral and posterior thalamo-perforating arteries, the proximal portion of the anterior ponto-mesencephalic vein and the proximal portions of the oculomotor nerves. Anteriorly, the interpeduncular cistern extends to the optic chiasma.</div><div class="text" id="p0555">The cistern of the lateral sulcus (Sylvian cistern) is formed by the arachnoid as it bridges the lateral sulcus between the frontal, parietal and temporal opercula and it contains the middle cerebral artery and veins.</div><div class="text" id="p0560">Several smaller cisterns have been described. They include the chiasmatic cistern (suprasellar cistern), which is related to the optic chiasma, the cistern of the lamina terminalis and the supracallosal cistern, all of which are extensions of the interpeduncular cistern and contain the anterior cerebral arteries. The subarachnoid space extends through the optic foramina into the orbits, where it is bounded by the sheath of the optic nerve. It is for this reason that a raised intracranial pressure is transmitted to the optic nerve and can be visible on direct examination of the fundus as papilloedema. The sheath of the optic nerve is formed by fusion of the arachnoid mater and dura mater, and surrounds the orbital portion of each optic nerve as far as the back of the globe, where the dura fuses with the sclera of the eyeball.

At term, the number and complexity of the villi increase. It is generally believed that the fetal and early infantile villi do not fully penetrate the dura, but with maturation they grow in size, achieve penetration through the wall of the venous sinus, and are thereafter referred to as arachnoid granulations. In the elderly, the arachnoid membrane thickens and the arachnoid granulations degenerate and often calcify.</div><div class="text" id="p0585">The function of arachnoid granulations is not fully understood, although they are thought to be involved in the reabsorption of CSF. There are observations both to support and to question their role in the absorption of CSF. Their relative paucity in the fetal and early postnatal period strongly suggests the importance of other absorption routes. The degenerative changes in arachnoid granulations in old age could be the substrate for the condition of ‘normal pressure hydrocephalus’ and for decreased CSF absorption, which could play an important role in degenerative brain diseases of the elderly. An alternative, and not necessarily mutually exclusive, view of arachnoid granulations is that they are involved in dissipating the pressure wave that occurs in the subarachnoid space during arterial systole (caused by the pulsation of the arterial vessels within the space). Since the dural venous sinuses lie within thick, non-compliant dural coverings, pressure changes within them functionally represent the extracranial venous compartment; systolic dilation of the arachnoid granulations would therefore dissipate intracranial pressure changes into the extracranial venous system.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="414" id="pagebreak_414"/><a id="pg414"/></div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0290"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0245">Pia Mater</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0595">The pia mater is a delicate membrane that closely invests the surface of the brain and spinal cord, from which it is separated by a microscopic subpial space. It follows the contours of the brain into concavities and the depths of fissures and sulci. In the spinal canal, it contributes to the formation of the dentate ligaments and the filum terminale (<a href="#bib27" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_27">Adeeb et al 2013</a>) (see <a href="../B9780702077050000471/B9780702077050000471.xhtml#f0010">Figs 47.1C</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000471/B9780702077050000471.xhtml#f0030">47.5</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0600">Pia mater is formed from a layer of leptomeningeal cells, often only 1–2 cells thick, in which the cells are joined by desmosomes and gap junctions but few, if any, tight junctions. The cells are continuous with the coating of the subarachnoid trabeculae and separated from the basal lamina of the glia limitans by bundles of collagen, fibroblast-like cells and microscopic vessels that lie in the subpial space (<a href="#bib52" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_52">Mercier et al 2002</a>) (see <a href="#f0110">Fig. 25.24</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0605">It was long thought that the subarachnoid space was connected directly with the perivascular spaces (Virchow–Robin spaces) that surround blood vessels in the brain. However, it is now recognized that the pia mater is reflected from the surface of the brain onto the surface of blood vessels in the subarachnoid space, which means that the subarachnoid space is separated by a layer of pia from the subpial and perivascular spaces of the brain (see <a href="#f0110">Fig. 25.24</a>). The pia mater appears to form a regulatory interface between the subarachnoid space and the brain, across which small molecules may diffuse between the interstitial space and the CSF through the perivascular space. This may allow movement of metabolites and could play a role in blood–brain barrier function (<a href="#bib77" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_77">Zhang et al 1990</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0610">During development, the pia mater becomes apposed to the ependyma in the roof of the telencephalon and fourth ventricle to form the tela choroidea.
