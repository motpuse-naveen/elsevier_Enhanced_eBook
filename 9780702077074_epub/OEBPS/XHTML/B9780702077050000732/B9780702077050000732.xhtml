They are supported by complex neurovasculature which contributes to urinary and sexual function. The bladder is structurally similar between males and females and receives urine downstream from the kidneys and ureters. It is a major component of the micturition pathway and functions to store and empty urine. The urethra is the conduit which passes urine and ejaculate from the bladder and prostate, respectively, to outside of the body. The urethra is structurally different between men and women due to the presence of the penis. The prostate plays an integral role in ejaculation and is commonly a source of urinary obstruction and cancer in men.</p></div></div></section>--><!--<section><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Keywords</h3><div class="keywords">benign prostatic hyperplasia; bladder; micturition; penis; prostate cancer; prostate; ureteral orifice; urethra</div></section>--><section><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Urinary Bladder</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0010">The urinary bladder is a reservoir. Its size, shape, position and relations all vary according to its content and the state of the neighbouring viscera. When the bladder is empty, it lies entirely in the lesser pelvis, but as it distends it expands superiorly into the abdominal cavity (<span class="bold">Video 73.1</span>). An empty bladder is somewhat tetrahedral and has a fundus, body, neck, apex and superior and inferolateral surfaces.</div><section><a id="s0015"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0025">Relations</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0020">The fundus of the bladder is triangular and located posteroinferiorly. In females it is closely related to the anterior vaginal wall (<a href="#f0070"><span class="bold">Fig. 73.1</span></a>); in males it is related to the rectum, although it is separated from it superiorly by the rectovesical pouch and inferiorly by the seminal gland (vesicle) and ductus (vas) deferens on each side, and by the prostato-seminal fascia (Denonvilliers’ fascia) (<a href="#f0080"><span class="bold">Fig. 73.2</span></a>). The neck of the bladder, which is most fixed, lies most inferiorly, 3–4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm behind the lower part of the pubic symphysis and just above the plane of the inferior aperture of the lesser pelvis. Essentially, the neck of the bladder is the internal urethral orifice, which lies in a constant position irrespective of the varying positions of the bladder and rectum. In males the neck rests on and is directly continuous with the base of the prostate; in females it is related to the pelvic fascia that surrounds the upper urethra. In both sexes the apex of the bladder, when not full, faces towards the upper part of the pubic symphysis. The median umbilical ligament (urachus) ascends behind the anterior abdominal wall from the apex of the bladder to the umbilicus, covered by peritoneum to form the median umbilical fold (see below).</div><div class="text" id="p0025"><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0070"><!--<img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000732/main.assets/f73-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/>--><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0070"/><a id="fspara0070"/><!--<span class="fignum">Fig. 73.1</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, The relations of the female bladder, sagittal section of the pelvis.

This adheres more to the bladder than to the anterior surface of the prostate, which aids reliable identification of the region of the neck of the bladder surgically. In males each inferolateral surface is related anteriorly to the pubis and puboprostatic ligaments. In females the relations are similar, except that the pubovesical ligaments replace the puboprostatic ligaments (see later for a fuller description). The inferolateral surfaces are not covered by peritoneum. The triangular superior surface is bounded by lateral borders from the apex to the ureteric entrances, and by a posterior border that joins them. In males the superior surface is completely covered by peritoneum, which extends slightly on to the fundus and continues posteriorly into the rectovesical pouch and anteriorly into the median umbilical fold; it is in contact with the sigmoid colon and the terminal part of the ileum. In females the superior surface is largely covered by peritoneum, which is reflected posteriorly on to the uterus at the level of the anatomical internal os of the uterus (the junction of the body and isthmus of the uterus) to form the vesico-uterine pouch. The posterior part of the superior surface, devoid of peritoneum, is separated from the supravaginal part of the cervix by fibroareolar tissue.</div><div class="text" id="p0050">These relations are important in managing bladder trauma. Extraperitoneal injuries can often be managed conservatively because urine is contained, whereas intraperitoneal injuries usually require surgical repair since urine within the abdominal cavity can cause peritonitis, ileus and infection.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1277" id="pagebreak_1277"/><a id="pg1277"/></div><div class="text" id="p0055">As the bladder fills it becomes ovoid (see <span class="bold">Video 73.1</span>). Anteriorly, it displaces the parietal peritoneum from the suprapubic region of the anterior abdominal wall. Its inferolateral surfaces become anterior and rest against the abdominal wall without intervening peritoneum for a distance above the pubic symphysis that varies with the degree of distension, but is commonly 5–7<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm. If normal catheterization of the urinary bladder via the urethra is unsuccessful, the distended bladder can be punctured just above the pubic symphysis without traversing the peritoneum (suprapubic cystostomy) (see <a href="#f0080">Fig. 73.2A</a>); surgical access to the bladder through the anterior abdominal wall is usually by this route. The summit of the full bladder points superiorly and anteriorly above the attachment of the median umbilical ligament, so that the peritoneum forms a supravesical fossa of varying depth between the summit and the anterior abdominal wall; this recess often contains coils of small intestine. The bladder is more cranially located at birth than in the adult because the lesser pelvis is shallow, and the internal urethral orifice is level with the upper border of the pubic symphysis. The bladder is then abdominal rather than pelvic and extends about two-thirds of the distance towards the umbilicus.</div><div class="text" id="p0060">Urine samples can, therefore, be obtained in children by performing suprapubic needle puncture.

The puboprostatic and pubovesical ligaments have been variously and somewhat confusingly described in the literature. In the <span class="italic">Terminologia Anatomica</span>, both ligaments are listed as having medial and lateral components; the pubovesical ligament (presumably both medial and lateral parts) is also listed as synonymous with the medial puboprostatic ligament. Cadaveric dissection, histological and plastinated section studies (e.g. <a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_10">DeLancey 1989</a>, <a href="#bib52" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_52">Xu et al 2017</a>) have identified the puboprostatic ligament as the anterior layer of the detrusor apron joined by decussated and un-decussated fibres of pubococcygeus; or part of the detrusor apron connecting the bladder to the pubic bone; or the merged fibres of the visceral endopelvic fascia. The pubovesical ligaments have been described as either an extension of the detrusor and its adventitia that is attached to the pubic bone and arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis, or the female equivalent of the medial puboprostatic ligaments, and either separate from the pubo-urethral ligaments or the superior extensions of the pubo-urethral ligaments.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">The apex of the bladder is connected to the umbilicus by the remains of the urachus, which forms the median umbilical ligament (<span class="bold">Video 73.2</span>). The urachus is composed of longitudinal muscle fibres derived from detrusor and becomes more fibrous towards the umbilicus. It usually maintains a lumen lined with epithelium that persists into adult life but is only rarely complicated by a urachal cyst, sinus, fistula or adenocarcinoma.</div><div class="text" id="p0090">The urachus could be critical for maintaining fetal life when atresia of the urethra results in complete obstruction to the flow of amniotic fluid. Anhydramnios noted at 17 weeks’ gestation has been reported to resolve by 21 weeks when the patent urachus acts as a fistula between the bladder and the amniotic cavity, preserving pulmonary and renal function (<a href="#bib946" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_946">Stalberg and Gonzalez 2012</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0095">Other ligaments that have been described in relation to the fundus of the urinary bladder are the lateral, uterosacral and cardinal ligaments. The lateral ligament was described by <a href="#bib28" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_28">Miles in 1908</a>: although never described in anatomical cadaveric dissection studies, it is recognized clinically as an important structure in the pararectal fossa at operation. It is a broad band of dense connective tissue, ranging in depth from 5 to 7<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm, and passing between the lateral wall of the pelvis and the fundus of the bladder at the point where the ureter terminates.

From the superior surface of the bladder, the peritoneum is carried off in a series of folds: the ‘false’ ligaments of the bladder. Anteriorly, there are three folds (<a href="#f0095"><span class="bold">Fig. 73.5</span></a>): the median umbilical fold over the median umbilical ligament (urachus), and two medial umbilical folds over the occluded parts of the umbilical arteries.

The large-diameter fasciculi characteristic of detrusor are replaced by small-diameter fasciculi that extend obliquely or longitudinally into the urethral wall. In the normal female the neck of the bladder sits above the pelvic diaphragm, supported predominantly by the pubovesical ligaments (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 73.4A</a>), the endopelvic fascia of the pelvic diaphragm and levator ani. These structures support the urethra at rest; with elevated intra-abdominal pressure, the pelvic diaphragm contracts, increasing urethral closure pressure to maintain continence. This anatomical arrangement commonly alters after parturition and with increasing age, such that the neck of the bladder lies beneath the pelvic diaphragm, particularly when intra-abdominal pressure rises. This means that the mechanism described above fails to maintain continence and females can experience stress incontinence (<a href="#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_19">Klutke and Siegel 1995</a>).<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1280" id="pagebreak_1280"/><a id="pg1280"/></div></section><section><a id="s0070"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0070">Males</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0140">In males the neck of the bladder is completely surrounded by a circular collar of smooth muscle with its own distinct adrenergic innervation, which extends distally to surround the intramural part of the urethra. These smooth muscle bundles are distinct from those that run in continuity from the neck of the bladder down to the prostatic urethra, and from the smooth muscle within the prostate. The bundles that form the internal urethral (preprostatic) sphincter are small compared with the muscle bundles of detrusor, and are separated by a relatively large connective tissue component rich in elastic fibres.</div><div class="text" id="p0145">The neck of the bladder is sometimes called the proximal or internal urethral sphincter mechanism, to distinguish it from the distal or external urethral sphincter. The internal urethral sphincter contributes to urinary continence and, in the face of distal sphincteric incompetence, can at times maintain continence independently.

The muscle fasciculi increase in size and, because they interlace in all directions, a thick-walled ‘trabeculated bladder’ is produced (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 73.7D</a>). Mucosa between the fascicles forms ‘diverticula’ owing to the increased intravesical pressure required to pass urine through the obstruction. When outflow is obstructed, emptying may not be complete; some urine can remain and lead to infection and stone formation within the bladder. Back-pressure from a chronically distended bladder can gradually dilate the ureters, renal pelves and even the renal collecting ducts bilaterally and can result in progressive renal impairment.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0080"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0080">Vascular supply and lymphatic drainage</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0085">Arteries</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0085"/><div class="textfl" id="p0155">The bladder is supplied principally by the superior and inferior vesical arteries (see <a href="../B9780702077050000756/B9780702077050000756.xhtml#f0020">Figs 75.3</a>, <a href="../B9780702077050000720/B9780702077050000720.xhtml#f0085">72.20C</a>), derived from the anterior division of the internal iliac artery and supplemented by the obturator and inferior gluteal arteries.

The sympathetic fibres are derived from neuronal cell bodies in the lower three thoracic and upper two lumbar segments of the spinal cord and form the coeliac and mesenteric plexuses in the abdomen; from here, the superior hypogastric plexus descends into the pelvis as fairly discrete nerve bundles within the extraperitoneal connective tissue posterior to the ureter on each side. The anterior part of the inferior hypogastric plexus is known as the vesical plexus. Small groups of autonomic neurones occur within the plexus and throughout all regions of the bladder wall. These multipolar intramural neurones are rich in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and occur in ganglia containing up to 20 neuronal cell bodies. Most of the preganglionic nerve terminals correspond morphologically to presumptive cholinergic fibres. Noradrenergic terminals also relay on cell bodies in the inferior hypogastric plexus; it is not known whether similar nerves synapse on intramural bladder ganglia.</div><div class="text" id="p0190">The urinary bladder is profusely supplied with nerves, which form a dense plexus among detrusor muscle cells. Most of these nerves contain AChE and are abundant throughout the muscle layer of the bladder. Axonal varicosities adjacent to detrusor muscle cells possess features that are considered to typify cholinergic nerve terminals, and contain clusters of small (50<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>nm diameter) agranular vesicles, occasional large (80–160<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>nm diameter) granulated vesicles and small mitochondria.

Non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nerves have been identified, and a number of other neurotransmitters or neuromodulators have been detected in intramural ganglia, including the peptide somatostatin. The superficial trigone muscle is associated with more noradrenergic (sympathetic) fibres than cholinergic (parasympathetic) nerves, a difference that supports the view that the superficial trigone muscle should be regarded as ‘ureteric’ rather than ‘vesical’ in origin. However, it should be emphasized that this muscle forms a very minor part of the total muscle mass of the neck of the bladder and proximal urethra in either sex and is probably of little significance in the physiological mechanisms that control these regions.</div><div class="text" id="p0200">The smooth muscle of the neck of the bladder in males is predominantly orientated obliquely or circularly. It is sparsely supplied with cholinergic (parasympathetic) nerves but possesses a rich noradrenergic (sympathetic) innervation. There is a similar distribution of autonomic nerves in the smooth muscle of the prostate, seminal glands and ducti deferentia. Stimulation of sympathetic nerves causes contraction of smooth muscle in the wall of the genital tract, resulting in seminal emission. Concomitant sympathetic stimulation of the proximal urethral smooth muscle causes sphincteric closure of the internal urethral sphincter, preventing reflux of ejaculate into the bladder.</div><div class="text" id="p0205">The neck of the bladder is disrupted in the vast majority of men undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate and this can result in retrograde ejaculation. Similarly, an ejaculation can result when the sympathetic fibres are disrupted during retroperitoneal lymph node dissection surgery. Although this genital function of the neck of the bladder of the male is well established, it is not known whether the smooth muscle of this region contributes actively to the maintenance of urinary continence. In contrast, in females the smooth muscle of the neck of the bladder contains relatively few noradrenergic nerves but is richly supplied with cholinergic fibres. The sparse supply of sympathetic nerves presumably relates to the absence of a functioning ‘genital’ portion of the wall of the female urethra.</div><div class="text" id="p0210">The lamina propria of the fundus and inferolateral walls of the bladder is virtually devoid of autonomic nerve fibres, apart from some noradrenergic and occasional cholinergic perivascular nerves. However, the density of nerves unrelated to blood vessels increases closer to the internal urethral orifice. At the neck of the bladder and trigone a nerve plexus of cholinesterase-positive axons extends throughout the lamina propria, independent of blood vessels. Some of the larger diameter axons are myelinated and others lie adjacent to the basal urothelial cells. In the absence of any obvious effector target sites, the subepithelial nerve plexuses of the bladder and the ureter are assumed to subserve a sensory function.</div></section><section><a id="s0125"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0120">Afferent fibres</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0215">Visceral afferent nerves supplying the bladder are concerned with awareness of distension and pain and are stimulated by distension or spasm due to a stone, inflammation or malignant disease; they travel in sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, predominantly the latter (<a href="#bib45" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_45">Shoja et al 2013</a>).

These injuries usually affect the junction of the membranous with the bulbar part of the spongy urethra across the perineal membrane. One complication associated with such injuries is extravasation of urine. After an injury to the bulbar part of the spongy urethra, urine usually extravasates between the perineal membrane and the membranous layer of the superficial fascia (Colles’ fascia). As both of these are attached firmly to the ischiopubic rami, extravasated fluid cannot pass posteriorly because the two layers are continuous around superficial transverse perineal muscles. Laterally, the spread of urine is blocked by the pubic and ischial rami. Urine cannot enter the lesser pelvis through the perineal membrane if this remains intact, and so it tracks anteriorly into the loose connective tissue of the scrotum and penis, and, from there, to the anterior abdominal wall. If the posterior urethra is injured, urine is extravasated into the pelvic extraperitoneal tissue; if the perineal membrane is also torn, then urine may be extravasated into the perineum.</div></section><section><a id="s0215"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0190">Congenital anomalies of the male urethra</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0320">Hypospadias, found in 1 in 300 boys, most often results in the urethra opening on the distal, urethral surface of the penis. There is also an associated abnormality of the prepuce, which is longer dorsally and lacking ventrally, and often an associated chordee, which causes a ventral curvature of the penis. The microvessel density of the prepuce is reduced in children with hypospadias and this has surgical implications when preputial flaps are used for the repair of hypospadias (<a href="#bib55" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_55">Yucel et al 2004</a>, <a href="#bib6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_6">Cağrı Savaş et al 2011</a>).

The most common type (type I) is believed to occur if the mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts open too anteriorly on to the primitive prostatic urethra; this abnormal migration of the ducts leaves behind thick vestigial tissue that forms rigid valve cusps extending caudally from the seminal colliculus. Megalourethra can be associated with posterior urethral valves. Congenital anterior urethral valves are a rare cause of urethral obstruction in boys and may be associated with posterior urethral valves and hypospadias.</div><div class="text" id="p0340">Very rarely, urethral duplication occurs; the two urethrae almost invariably lie on top of each other rather than side by side.

The cavernous nerves of the penis pierce the bulb of the penis to innervate the corpora cavernosa. Sympathetic nerves that supply the internal urethral sphincter are derived from the inferior hypogastric plexus as it descends in the pelvis adjacent to the prostate; they function to prevent retrograde ejaculation. Parasympathetic preganglionic axons arise from neuronal cell bodies in the second to fourth sacral spinal cord segments. The nerve supply of the external urethral sphincter is controversial. It is generally believed to be supplied by neurones in the nucleus of the pudendal nerve (Onuf’s nucleus) travelling in branches of the inferior hypogastric plexus and by perineal branches of the pudendal nerve lying on the perineal aspect of the pelvic diaphragm; in both instances, the axons arise from neurones in the second to fourth sacral spinal segments.

Branching tubular urethral glands secrete protective mucus on to the urethral epithelial lining and are especially numerous on its dorsal aspect. In the older male, many of the deep recesses of the urethral mucosa contain concretions similar to those found within prostatic glands (see <a href="#f0065">Fig. 73.19A</a>). Towards the distal end of the spongy urethra the epithelium changes once again, and becomes stratified squamous with well-defined connective tissue papillae. This type of epithelium also lines the navicular fossa and becomes keratinized at the external urethral orifice.

In the absence of an anatomical neck of the bladder sphincter, competence of the female neck of the bladder and proximal urethra is unlikely to depend totally on smooth muscle activity and is more probably related to the support provided by the ligamentous structures that surround them.

The peripheral zone is cup-shaped and encloses the central transition zone and the intramural part of the urethra, except anteriorly, where the space is filled by the anterior fibromuscular stroma.

The central and transition zones have relatively low signal intensity and are often referred to as the ‘central gland’. The seminal colliculus can be seen as high-signal within the central gland. The relations of the zones of the gland normally change with age. The central zone atrophies and the transition zone enlarges secondary to BPH.

Follicles are represented by small end-buds on the ducts. Before birth, the epithelium of the ducts, seminal colliculus and prostatic utricle display hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia, possibly due to maternal oestrogens in the fetal blood. This subsides after birth and is followed by a period of quiescence lasting for 12–14 years.</div><div class="text" id="p0580">At puberty, between the ages of approximately 14 and 18 years, the prostate enters a maturation phase and more than doubles in size. Growth is almost entirely due to follicular development, partly from end-buds on ducts and partly from modification of the ductal branches. Morphogenesis and differentiation of the epithelial cords starts in an intermediate part of the epithelial anlage and proceeds to the urethral and subcapsular parts of the gland; the latter is reached by the age of 17–18 years. The glandular epithelium is initially multilayered squamous or cuboidal and is transformed into a pseudostratified epithelium consisting of basal, exocrine secretory (including mucous) and neuroendocrine cells. The mucous cells are temporary and are lost as the gland matures. The remaining exocrine secretory cells produce a number of products, including acid phosphatase, prostate-specific antigen and β-microseminoprotein. Growth of the secretory component is associated with condensation of the stroma, which diminishes relative to the glandular tissue. These changes are probably a response to the secretion of testosterone by the testis.</div><div class="text" id="p0585">During the third decade, the glandular epithelium grows by irregular multiplication of the epithelial infoldings into the lumen of the follicles. After the third decade, the size of the prostate remains virtually unaltered until 45–50 years, when the epithelial foldings tend to disappear, follicular outlines become more regular and amyloid bodies increase in number: all signs of prostatic involution. After 45–50 years, the prostate tends to develop BPH: an age-related condition (<a href="#bib43" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_43">Roehrborn 2008</a>).

Macronodules, in turn, compress the surrounding normal tissue of the peripheral zone posteroinferiorly, creating a ‘false capsule’ around the hyperplastic tissue, which, coincidentally, provides a plane of cleavage for its surgical enucleation.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1291" id="pagebreak_1291"/><a id="pg1291"/></div></section></section></section><footer><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1291.e1" id="pagebreak_1291.e1"/><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebib0010"/><h2 class="reftitle" id="s0375">References</h2><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebibsec0010"/><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib1"><!--<a hreef="#bib_1">1</a>. --><a id="ref0040"/><a href="#bib_1">Andersson</a> K.E, McCloskey K.D. <cite>Lamina propria: the functional center of the bladder?</cite> <cite><i>Neurourol Urodyn</i></cite>. 2014;33:9–16.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib2"><!--<a hreef="#bib_2">2</a>. --><a id="ref0045"/><a href="#bib_2">Bertrand</a> M.M, Alsaid B, Droupy S, et al. <cite>Anatomical basis of the coordination between smooth and striated urethral and anal sphincters: loops of regulation between inferior hypogastric plexus and pudendal nerve.
