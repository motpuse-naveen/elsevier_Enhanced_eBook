This is particularly true of the corticospinal system. All mammals have a corticospinal tract, which originates from a number of parietal and frontal cortical areas, and which projects to different regions of the spinal cord. However, in functional terms, the different components of the corticospinal projection show large species-specific contrasts. There are also marked variations in other anatomical features, such as range of fibre sizes, spinal trajectory, pattern of termination within the spinal grey matter, and extent of the tract along the length of the spinal cord.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0010">Cortical Origin</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0015">There is a basic pattern across all mammals for the cortical areas that give rise to the corticospinal tract. There are more areas in primates than in non-primates. In the former they include primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortex, parietal area 5, S2, and frontal areas including dorsal and ventral premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area (all area 6) and a family of cingulate motor areas in the cingulate cortex on the medial surface of the hemisphere. In all of these areas, corticospinal fibres arise only from lamina V, which of course is very thick in motor cortex. In humans, all of these areas probably give rise to corticospinal fibres. Classical studies suggested that 60% of these fibres come from the frontal areas and 40% from parietal.</div><section><a id="s0015"/><section><a id="s0020"/><h3 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0015">Number and size of axons</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0020">The number of fibres in the mammalian corticospinal (pyramidal) tract varies from around 30,000 from each cortical hemisphere in the mouse, up to around 1 million fibres in humans. There is a close relationship between fibre number, overall body weight and brain size. In all mammals the great majority of the fibres are of small diameter (&lt;3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm). In some large-bodied primates, there are larger fibres (&gt;8<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm) and the largest are in humans (22<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm), but large fibres make up only a few per cent of all fibres in the tract.</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0020">Spinal trajectory</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0025">The course taken by corticospinal fibres within the spinal cord shows great variation. In rodents, rabbits and opossums most of the fibres are located at the base of the dorsal columns, whereas in elephants and hedgehogs, they are exclusively in the ventral funiculus. In carnivores and primates, most of the fibres are in the dorsolateral funiculus, with a smaller number of uncrossed fibres travelling in the ventral funiculus. A few fibres may also be scattered in the dorsal columns. In humans, fibres making up the lateral corticospinal tract are found throughout the dorsolateral funiculus (<a href="#f0010">Fig. 3.1.1</a>), although they are considered to lie slightly medial to the ascending dorsocerebellar tract fibres, which occupy the most lateral part of the dorsolateral funiculus. There is no obvious somatotopic organization within the various corticospinal tracts: fibres from different subdivisions (arm, leg) of M1, for example, are intermingled, as are projections from different cortical areas.</div><section><a id="sf0010"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000896/main.assets/f89-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 3.1.1</span> Pattern of corticospinal projections from motor cortex in five different species. The black dots in the white matter funiculi indicate the trajectory of crossed corticospinal fibres, which are found in the dorsal columns in the opossum, but mostly in the dorsolateral funiculus in the other species shown.

The black dots in the spinal grey matter indicate the termination of corticospinal fibres, as determined from visualization of degenerating terminals. The diagrams illustrate the ventral shift of terminations from opossum, where most fibres terminate in the contralateral dorsal horn; to cat, where fibres terminate in the contralateral intermediate zone; to the rhesus monkey, chimpanzee and human, which show progressively greater numbers of terminals in the lateral motor neurone pools of the ventral horn.

This is also the case in carnivores and rodents. Thus the tract can influence spinal mechanisms concerned with all four limbs (and tail when present). In some species, such as elephants, and ungulates such as goats, the tract does not extend beyond the upper cervical cord. Indeed, in the elephant the heaviest motor projection is to the facial nucleus, supplying the muscles of its trunk. In rodents, the heaviest motor projection from the cortex is again to the facial nucleus, with direct projections involved in the whisker movements, so important for the rodent’s exploration of space.</div><section><a id="s0035"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0030">Pattern of spinal termination</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0035"><a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_3">Kuypers (1981)</a> reviewed the pattern of corticospinal termination in the spinal grey matter across different species (see <a href="#f0010">Fig. 3.1.1</a>). He recognized that from rodents to carnivores and New World monkeys and from Old World monkeys to chimpanzees and humans there was a distinctive ventral shift in the pattern of terminations.</div><section><a id="s0040"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0035">Projections to the dorsal horn</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0040">Kuypers stressed that in rodents and more primitive mammals, the major termination of the tract was in the dorsal horn, and this has been confirmed repeatedly for mouse and rat (<a href="#f0015">Fig. 3.1.2</a>). This suggests that at least one function of the tract, probably shared across all mammals and including humans, is the descending control of afferent input, including nociceptive input. This descending control may be very important for sensorimotor control, and in particular for the rapid recognition of predictable patterns of somatosensory input resulting from planned movements. Descending corticospinal signals can alter pain thresholds. In primates, most of the projections to the dorsal horn probably come from S1 (see <a href="#f0015">Fig. 3.1.2</a>), and there is only a weak projection to the dorsal horn from frontal motor areas.</div><section><a id="sf0015"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0015"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000896/main.assets/f89-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0015"/><a id="fspara0015"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 3.1.2</span> Corticospinal projections to the dorsal horn in macaque and rat: <span class="bold">A</span> shows the labelling of corticospinal terminals in the dorsal horn of the macaque cord after injection of anterograde (H<sup>3</sup> leucine) tracer in the contralateral somatosensory cortex (S1).

In macaques, quantitative analysis of terminal boutons, labelled after injections of tracer material in the M1 hand/arm region, shows that the number of boutons within lamina IX is second only to those in lamina VII (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 3.1.3</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0055">Retrograde transneuronal virus labelling from different upper limb muscles in macaques suggests that only two areas give rise to significant numbers of CM projections: the caudal part of M1 (‘new’ M1) and area 3a.</div><div class="text" id="p0060">The functional implications of this conspicuous ventral shift in termination pattern are still being researched, but there are some important clues in terms of the comparative anatomy. The long-standing idea that the presence of direct CM projections contributes to the capacity for skilled control of the hand is supported by the fact that CM projections are only well developed in those primates that are tool users/tool manufacturers. These include the New World capuchin monkey and Old World macaque monkey, baboon and the great apes. There is a well-established correlation between the strength of this projection, the size of postsynaptic excitation in hand and digit motor neurones and the measure of digital dexterity (<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">Fig. 3.1.4</span></a>).</div><section><a id="sf0025"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0025"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000896/main.assets/f89-04-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0025"/><a id="fspara0025"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 3.1.4</span> Species variation in corticospinal organization and contribution to skilled upper limb movement. Relationship between the organization of corticospinal projections and fine motor skills involving the hand/paw. In rodents, there are no direct cortico-motoneuronal (CM) connections between corticospinal neurones and the cervical motor neurones which innervate forelimb muscles. In these species brainstem pathways and spinal interneurones relay cortical input to motor neurones. In non-human primates and humans, direct CM connections with motor neurones have evolved, together with an increase in the size and number of corticospinal fibres. This is reflected in an increase in the size of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) elicited by the corticospinal tract in hand motor neurones. CM EPSP amplitudes were assessed in hand motor neurones either by direct recording (monkeys) or inferred from analysis of hand muscle responses to non-invasive cortical stimulation (humans). These changes in the organization of the corticospinal system correlate with the improvement in the index of dexterity <br/><span class="figcredit">With permission from Lemon RN 2008 Descending pathways in motor control.

The remaining 10% descend ipsilaterally, mostly in the ventral corticospinal tract. The functions of these two components of the tract is still being investigated. The classical story is that the crossed fibres are mostly involved in control of the contralateral extremity, via their terminations in lamina VII and the lateral motor neurone pools, while ipsilateral fibres make bilateral terminations in lamina VIII and the medial motor neurone pools, innervating axial and girdle muscles.</div><div class="text" id="p0070">This account will need to be revised in the light of research in macaques which points to the fact that the balance between contralateral versus ipsilateral terminations (i.e. where the fibres exert their synaptic actions, as opposed to their trajectory within the cord) may vary substantially between cortical areas and for cervical versus lumbosacral enlargement. Projections from the arm/hand region of macaque M1 terminate almost entirely in the contralateral grey matter of C5–T1 (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 3.1.3A</a>), suggesting that even those fibres that descend ipsilaterally from the M1 arm/hand area cross at the segmental level and terminate contralaterally. In contrast to the arm/hand region, projections from M1 leg area are bilateral and exert bilateral effects on the lumbosacral cord, and this may reflect the involvement of leg motor cortex in skilled forms of locomotion such as skiing, dancing, etc. Secondary motor areas such as the SMA and the dorsal and ventral premotor areas generally give to a greater degree of bilateral projections to the cervical cord.</div></section></section></section></section></section><footer><section role="doc-bibliography" epub:type="bibliography"><a id="cebib0010"/><h2 class="reftitle" id="s0060">Bibliography</h2><section><a id="cebibsec0010"/><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib1"><!--<a hreef="#bib_1">1</a>. --><a id="ref0010"/><a href="#bib_3">Dum</a> R.P, Strick P.L. <cite>The origin of corticospinal projections from the premotor areas in the frontal lobe</cite>. <cite><i>J Neurosci</i></cite>. 1991;11:667–689.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib2"><!--<a hreef="#bib_2">2</a>. --><a id="ref0015"/><a href="#bib_3">Firmin</a> L, Field P, Maier M.A, et al. <cite>Axon diameters and conduction velocities in the macaque pyramidal tract</cite>. <cite><i>J Neurophysiol</i></cite>. 2014;112:1229–1240.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib3"><!--<a hreef="#bib_3">3</a>. --><a id="ref0020"/><a href="#bib_3">Kuypers</a> H.G.J.M. <cite>Anatomy of descending pathways</cite>. In: Brookhart J.M, Mountcastle V.B, Brooks V.B, et al., eds. <cite><i>Handbook of Physiology</i></cite>. vol. 2. Bethesda, MD: American Physiological Society; 1981:597–666 Motor Control, pt 1.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib40"><!--<a hreef="#bib_40">40</a>. --><a id="ref0025"/><a href="#bib_3">Lemon</a> R.N. <cite>Descending pathways in motor control</cite>. <cite><i>Ann Rev Neurosci</i></cite>. 2008;31:195–218.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib4"><!--<a hreef="#bib_4">4</a>. --><a id="ref0030"/><a href="#bib_3">Liu</a> Y, Latremoliere A, et al. <cite>Touch and tactile neuropathic pain sensitivity are set by corticospinal projections</cite>. <cite><i>Nature</i></cite>. 2018;561:547–550.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib5"><!--<a hreef="#bib_5">5</a>. --><a id="ref0035"/><a href="#bib_3">Porter</a> R, Lemon R.N. <cite><i>Corticospinal function and voluntary movement</i></cite>. Oxford: Clarendon Press; 1993.</p><p class="biblio" role="doc-biblioentry" epub:type="biblioentry footnote" id="bib6"><!--<a hreef="#bib_6">6</a>. --><a id="ref0040"/><a href="#bib_3">Rathelot</a> J.-A, Strick P.L. <cite>Subdivisions of primary motor cortex based on cortico-motoneuronal cells</cite>. <cite><i>PNAS</i></cite>. 2009;106:918–923.</p></section></section></footer></section></body></html>
