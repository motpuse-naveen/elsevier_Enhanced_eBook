The structure of the eyelids is discussed in <a href="../B9780702077050000446/B9780702077050000446.xhtml">Chapter 44</a>.</div><section><a id="s0015"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0025">Scalp</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0015">The scalp extends from the top of the forehead anteriorly to the superior nuchal line posteriorly. Laterally, it projects down to the zygomatic arch and external acoustic meatus. It consists of five layers: skin, subcutaneous tissue, occipitofrontalis (epicranius) and its aponeurosis, subaponeurotic loose areolar tissue and the periosteum of the skull (pericranium).</div><div class="text" id="p0020">The skin of the scalp is hairy and rich in sebaceous glands, and is the most common site for sebaceous cysts. The dense subcutaneous connective tissue has the richest cutaneous blood supply in the body. The anterior and posterior muscular bellies of occipitofrontalis are connected by a tough, fibrous, epicranial aponeurosis, and this layer is therefore often called the aponeurotic layer (galea aponeurotica). These three upper layers of the scalp can easily slide on the underlying layer of loose connective tissue. A scalp flap can be raised within the plane between the galea and the pericranium without compromising either the blood or the nerve supply of the scalp because all of these structures lie in the subcutaneous layer (superficial fascia). Anteriorly based subgaleal scalp flaps (bicoronal) provide excellent access to the craniofacial skeleton for the correction of congenital deformity such as craniosynostoses; treatment of craniofacial fractures involving the frontal bone, nasoethmoidal complex, orbit or zygomatic arch; skull-base surgery; or craniotomies. Pericranial flaps can be used to separate the frontal sinus floor from the nasal cavity in the management of fractures of the posterior wall of the frontal sinus (frontal sinus cranialization). Traumatic scalp avulsion may happen if hair becomes trapped in moving machinery or a shearing force is applied in the subgaleal plane during a road traffic accident or fall injury.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">The arterial blood supply to the scalp is particularly rich; there are free anastomoses between branches of the occipital and superficial temporal vessels. Scalp lacerations continue to bleed profusely because the elastic fibres of the underlying galea aponeurotica prevent initial vessel retraction. Their repair requires a two-layer closure technique to approximate the galea aponeurotica and skin layers, whereas the pericranial layer, if involved, cannot usually be closed because it retracts.</div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0030">Eyebrows</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0030">The eyebrows are two arched eminences of skin that surmount the orbits. Numerous short, thick hairs are set obliquely in them. Fibres of orbicularis oculi, corrugator and the frontal part of occipitofrontalis are inserted into the dermis of the eyebrows.</div></section><section><a id="s0025"/><hgroup><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0035">Buccolabial tissue</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0040">Cheeks</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0030"/><div class="textfl" id="p0035">The cheeks are continuous anteriorly with the lips. The external junction is indicated by the nasolabial groove (sulcus) and further laterally by the nasolabial fold, which descends from the side of the nose to the angle of the mouth. The cheek is covered on the outer surface by skin and on the inner surface by mucosa. Each cheek contains the buccinator muscle, and a variable, but usually considerable, amount of adipose tissue, often encapsulated to form a biconcave mass, the buccal fat pad (of Bichat), that is particularly evident in infants. The walls of the cheek contain fibrous connective tissue, vessels, nerves and numerous small buccal mucous (salivary) glands. The buccal fat pad can be used for surgical reconstruction of small intraoral defects of the palate and buccal and retromolar regions.</div></section><section><a id="s0035"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0045">Lips</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0040">The lips are two fleshy folds surrounding the oral orifice. The centre of each lip contains a thick fibrous strand of parallel bundles of skeletal muscle fibres (orbicularis oris, together with incisivus superior and inferior and the direct labial tractors), and their attachments to skin, mucosa or other muscle fibres. The free external surface of each lip is covered by a thin keratinized epidermis and is continuous with the mucosa at the vermilion (red) zone of the lip. The dermis is well vascularized and contains numerous hair follicles, sebaceous glands (Fordyce spots) and sweat glands. Subcutaneous adipose tissue is scanty. The internal mucous surfaces are lined with a thick, non-keratinizing, stratified squamous epithelium. The submucosa is well vascularized and contains numerous minor salivary glands, which may be harvested for histological confirmation of Sjögren’s connective tissue disease.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">Between the skin and mucosa, the vermilion zone is covered with a specialized keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that is thin near the skin, increases in thickness slightly as the mucosa is approached, and thickens abruptly when true mucosa is reached. The epithelium is covered with transparent, dead squames and its deep surface is highly convoluted, interdigitating with abundant long dermal papillae. The latter carry a rich capillary plexus that imparts a dusky red colour. These surfaces are hairless, their dermis lacks sebaceous, sweat or mucous glands, and they are moistened with saliva by the tip of the tongue. The dense innervation of the lips is reflected in their acute sensitivity to light touch, attributable mainly to the increased density of Meissner’s corpuscles (see <a href="../B9780702077050000033/B9780702077050000033.xhtml#f0150">Fig. 3.29</a>) in the dermal papillae.</div><div class="text" id="p0050">The size and curvature of the exposed red-lip surfaces is subject to considerable variation. The attainment of adult dimensions is faster in the upper than in the lower lip; the cutaneous upper lip height normally reaches its adult size at the age of 3 years in females and 6 years in males (<a href="#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_8">Farkas et al 1992</a>). In children, all lip dimensions (distances, areas, volumes) are larger in boys than in girls (<a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Ferrario et al 2000</a>). Upper lip length is significantly shorter in females than in males and follows the growth pattern of the upper airway. Growth plateaus between the ages of 6 and 9 years, increases again from 9 to 16 years, and plateaus between 16 and 18 years (<a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_13">Gonçalves et al 2011</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0055">The line of contact between the lips, the oral fissure, lies just above the incisal edges of the anterior maxillary teeth. On each side, a labial commissure forms the angle (corner) of the mouth, usually near the first premolar tooth. The labial epithelia and internal tissues radiate over the boundaries of the commissure to become continuous with those of the cheek. With age, buccolabial (labiomarginal) grooves appear at the angles of the mouth. On each side, the upper lip is separated from the cheek laterally by the nasolabial groove and is continuous above the nasal ala with the circumalar groove (sulcus). The lower lip is separated from the chin by the mentolabial groove (sulcus).</div><div class="text" id="p0060">Externally, the central region of the upper lip presents a shallow vertical groove, the philtrum, limited above by its attachment to the columella of the nose and ending below in a slight tubercle limited by lateral ridges. The lower lip shows a small depression in the midline that corresponds to the tubercle. The junction between the external, hair-bearing skin and the red, hairless surface of the upper lip almost invariably takes the form of a double-curved Cupid’s bow. From the centre, it rises rapidly on each side to an apex that corresponds to the lower end of each ridge of the philtrum, and then slopes gently downwards towards the angle of the mouth. The line of contact between the red-lip surfaces is typically almost horizontal. The Cupid’s bow is interrupted in cleft lip anomalies.</div><div class="text" id="p0065">In the upper lip, a narrow band of smooth tissue related to the subnasal maxillae marks the point at which labial mucosa becomes continuous with gingival mucosa. The corresponding point in the lower lip coincides approximately with the mentolabial sulcus, where the labial mucosa is continuous with mental tissues. The upper and lower lips differ in cross-sectional profile in that neither is a simple fold of uniform thickness. The upper lip has a bulbous asymmetric profile where the skin and red-lip have a slight external convexity, and the adjoining red-lip and mucosa a pronounced internal convexity, creating a mucosal ridge or shelf that can be wrapped around the incisal edges of the parted <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="608" id="pagebreak_608"/>teeth. The lower lip is on a more posterior plane than the upper lip. In the position of neutral lip contact, the external surface of the lower lip is concave and there is little or no elevation of the internal mucosal surface. The profile of the lips can be modified by muscular activity.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0040"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0050">Relaxed skin tension lines and skin flaps on the face</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0070">The direction in which facial skin tension is greatest varies regionally. Skin tension lines follow the furrows formed when the skin is relaxed, and are known as ‘relaxed skin tension lines’ (<a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_3">Borges and Alexander 1962</a>). In the living face, these lines frequently (but not always) coincide with wrinkle lines (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 36.1</span></a>) and can therefore act as a guide in planning elective incisions.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000367/main.assets/f36-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 36.1</span> The distribution of relaxed skin tension lines (Kraissl’s lines). <span class="bold">A</span>, Lateral view. <span class="bold">B</span>, Anterior view.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0075">When lesions on the face, such as scars, pigmented lesions and skin cancers, are excised, the dimensions of these lesions often require excision as an ellipse, so that the resulting defect can be closed as a straight line. If the resulting scar is to be aesthetically acceptable, it is important to make the long axis of the ellipse parallel to the natural relaxed skin tension lines, so that the scar will look like a natural skin crease. If the excision line runs contrary to the skin tension lines, the scar may be more conspicuous and will tend to stretch transversely as a result of natural expressive facial movements. When larger lesions are excised, it may be necessary to advance or rotate adjacent soft tissue to fill the defect. The ability to raise these skin flaps is entirely dependent on the regional blood supply; both random pattern and axial pattern skin flaps are used surgically. The richness of the subdermal plexus in the face means that random pattern flaps can be raised with a greater length:breadth ratio than in any other part of the body.</div><div class="text" id="p0080">The following are examples of axial pattern flaps that can be used to reconstruct defects on the face and scalp. The supratrochlear/supraorbital arteries support forehead flaps that are used for nasal reconstruction; there is usually enough skin laxity to allow the majority of the donor site to be closed directly. The frontal branches of the superficial temporal arteries anastomose in the midline, which means that the entire forehead skin can be raised on a narrow pedicle based on just one of the superficial temporal arteries. These flaps can be used to repair many facial defects and also intraoral defects, but the donor site defect cannot be closed directly and must be covered by a skin graft. The parietal branch of the superficial temporal artery and the occipital artery can support hair-bearing flaps from the scalp and are useful for reconstructing defects involving the scalp. The nasolabial flap utilizes the lax skin just lateral to the nasolabial groove. It is not supplied by a named axial artery but rather its blood supply is provided by many small branches from the underlying facial artery that run perpendicular to the skin surface. Nasolabial flaps can be either superiorly or inferiorly based.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0045"/><hgroup><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0055">Soft Tissue</h2><h3 class="h2after1" id="cesectitle0060">Fascial layers</h3><h4 class="h3after2" id="cesectitle0065">Fascia of scalp</h4></hgroup><section><a id="s0050"/><section><a id="s0055"/><div class="textfl" id="p0085">The superficial fascia of the scalp is firm, dense and fibroadipose, and adheres closely to both skin and the underlying epicranius and its aponeurosis. Posteriorly, it is continuous with the superficial fascia of the posterior neck, and laterally it is prolonged into the temporal region, where it is looser in texture.</div></section><section><a id="s0060"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0070">Fascial layers and tissue planes in the face</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0090">On the basis of gross dissection and complementary histological studies, four distinct tissue planes are recognized on the face superficial to the plane of the facial nerve and its branches. From superficial to deep, these layers are the skin, a subcutaneous layer of fibroadipose tissue, the superficial musculo-aponeurotic system (SMAS), and the parotid–masseteric fascia.</div><section><a id="s0065"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0075">Subcutaneous fibroadipose tissue</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0095">The subcutaneous fibroadipose tissue is a homogeneous layer that is present throughout the face, although the degree of adiposity varies in different parts of the face and with age. Anteriorly, it crosses the nasolabial fold onto the lip. Superiorly, it crosses the zygomatic arch. In both locations, the layer is more fascial than fatty. The fat content of the subcutaneous tissue in the cheek accounts for the cheek mass, and is composed partly by the malar fat pad, a more or less discrete aggregation of fatty tissue inferolateral to the orbital margin.</div></section><section><a id="s0070"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0080">Superficial musculo-aponeurotic system (SMAS)</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0100">The superficial musculo-aponeurotic system (SMAS) is described as a single tissue plane in the face. In some areas it is composed of muscle fibres and elsewhere it is composed of fibrous or fibroaponeurotic tissue; it is not directly attached to bone. When traced below the level of the inferior border of the mandible, it becomes continuous with platysma in the neck. Microdissection has revealed that the SMAS becomes indistinct on the lateral aspect of the face approximately 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm below the level of the zygomatic arch. Anteromedially, the SMAS layer blends with the epimysium over some of the mimetic muscles, including zygomaticus major, frontalis and the periorbital fibres of orbicularis oculi (<a href="#bib32" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_32">Yousif and Mendelson 1995</a>). In most areas of the face, a distinct sub-SMAS plane can be defined deep to the SMAS that is continuous with the plane between platysma and the underlying investing layer of deep cervical fascia in the neck. However, where the SMAS overlies the parotid gland, it is firmly blended with the superficial layer of the parotid fascia, making it difficult, if not impossible, to define a clear sub-SMAS plane in the region of the parotid.</div></section><section><a id="s0075"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0085">Parotid–masseteric fascia</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0105">The parotid-masseteric fascia is thin, translucent and tough. It covers the parotid duct, the buccal branch of the facial nerve and interconnecting branches from the mandibular nerve where these structures lie on the surface of masseter. Further anteriorly, the parotid–masseteric fascia overlies the buccal fat pad that lies superficial to buccinator and blends with the epimysium on the surface of buccinator. It becomes continuous with the investing layer of deep cervical fascia below the inferior border of the mandible.</div></section><section><a id="s0080"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0090">Parotid fascia (capsule)</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0110">The parotid fascia (parotid capsule) surrounds the parotid gland. Traditionally it was described as an upward continuation of the investing layer of deep cervical fascia in the neck that split to enclose the gland within superficial and deep layers. The superficial layer was thought to be attached superiorly to the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, the cartilaginous part of the external acoustic meatus and the mastoid process, and the deep layer was attached to the mandible, the tympanic plate, and the styloid and mastoid processes of the temporal bone. The current view is that the deep layer of the parotid capsule is derived from the deep cervical fascia but that the superficial layer of the parotid capsule is<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="609" id="pagebreak_609"/> continuous with the fascia associated with platysma and is a component of the SMAS (<a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_26">Mitz and Peyronie 1976</a>, <a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_31">Wassef 1987</a>, <a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_14">Gosain et al 1993</a>). It varies in thickness from a thick fibrous layer anteriorly to a thin translucent membrane posteriorly. It may be traced forwards as a separate layer that passes over the masseteric fascia (also derived from the deep cervical fascia), separated from it by a cellular layer that contains branches of the facial nerve and the parotid duct. Histologically, the parotid fascia is atypical in that it contains muscle fibres in parallel with the fibres of platysma, especially in the lower part of the parotid capsule. Although thin fibrous septa may be seen in the subcutaneous layer histologically, macroscopically there is little evidence of a distinct layer of superficial fascia.</div><div class="text" id="p0115">The deep fascia covering the muscles that form the parotid bed (digastric and the styloid group of muscles) contains the stylomandibular and mandibulostylohyoid ligaments. The stylomandibular ligament passes from the styloid process to the angle of the mandible. The more extensive mandibulostylohyoid ligament (angular tract) passes between the angle of the mandible and the stylohyoid ligament for varying distances, generally reaching the hyoid bone. It is thick posteriorly but thins anteriorly in the region of the angle of the mandible. There is some dispute as to whether the mandibulostylohyoid ligament is part of the deep cervical fascia (<a href="#bib33" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_33">Ziarah and Atkinson 1981</a>) or lies deep to it (<a href="#bib29" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_29">Shimada and Gasser 1988</a>). The stylomandibular and mandibulostylohyoid ligaments separate the parotid gland from the superficial part of the submandibular gland, and so are landmarks of surgical interest.</div></section><section><a id="s0085"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0095">Temporoparietal and temporal fasciae</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0120">Above the level of the zygomatic arch, on the lateral side of the head, the temporoparietal fascia (superficial temporal fascia) constitutes a fascial layer that lies in the same plane as, but is not continuous with, the SMAS. It is quite separate from, and superficial to, the temporal fascia (deep temporal fascia). More superiorly, it blends with the galea aponeurotica. The plane between the temporoparietal fascia and the underlying deep temporal fascia contains loose areolar tissue and a small amount of fat. This tissue plane, the temporoparietal fat pad, is continuous superiorly with the subgaleal plane of loose areolar tissue in the scalp. Running superiorly in the temporoparietal fascia, or just deep to it, are the superficial temporal vessels, the auriculotemporal nerve and its branches, and the temporal branches of the facial nerve. When raising a bicoronal flap, identification of the temporoparietal fat pad helps to separate these two fascial layers, and subsequent dissection in a plane deep to the temporoparietal fascia protects the temporal branch of the facial nerve. The temporal fascia is a dense aponeurotic layer that lies deep to the temporoparietal fat pad and covers temporalis; the superficial fibres of temporalis are attached to the deep surface of the fascia. Superiorly, it is a single layer attached along the length of the superior temporal line, blending with the periosteum. Inferiorly, at approximately the level of the superior orbital rim, the temporal fascia splits into superficial and deep laminae that run downwards and are attached to the lateral and medial margins of the upper surface of the zygomatic arch, respectively. These fascial attachments have a clinical application in the reduction of fractures of the zygomatic complex via a Gillies approach: an instrument is inserted deep to the deep lamina of temporal fascia through a scalp incision and used to elevate depressed zygomatic complex fractures. The fat enclosed between these two layers, the superficial temporal fat pad, contains the zygomatico-orbital branch of the superficial temporal artery and a cutaneous nerve, the zygomaticotemporal branch of the maxillary nerve. The temporal fascia is overlapped by auriculares anterior and superior, the epicranial aponeurosis and part of orbicularis oculi; the superficial temporal vessels and the auriculotemporal nerve ascend over it.</div></section><section><a id="s0090"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0100">Buccopharyngeal fascia</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0125">The buccopharyngeal fascia is a thin layer of fascia that covers buccinator and the superior constrictor of the pharynx (<a href="../B9780702077050000409/B9780702077050000409.xhtml">Ch. 40</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0095"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0105">Retaining ligaments of the face</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0130">The retaining ligaments of the face are fascial bands at specific sites, e.g. the zygomatic ligament (McGregor’s patch) and the mandibular ligament.

These tubera vary but are especially prominent in young skulls and more so in adult females than males. Below them, and separated by a shallow groove, are two curved superciliary arches, medially prominent and joined by a smooth median elevated glabella. The arches are more prominent in males: prominence depends partly on the size of the frontal sinuses but is occasionally associated with small sinuses. The curved supraorbital margins of the orbital openings lie inferior to the superciliary arches. The lateral two-thirds of each margin are sharp, the medial one-third is rounded. A supraorbital notch or foramen that transmits the supraorbital vessels and nerve lies at the junction between them and a small frontal notch or foramen may lie medial to the supraorbital notch. The supraorbital margin ends laterally in a strong, prominent zygomatic process that articulates with the zygomatic bone. A line curves posterosuperiorly from the process and divides into superior and inferior temporal lines that continue on the squamous part of the temporal bone. The area of the frontal bone posteroinferior to the temporal lines is the temporal surface and forms the anterior part of the temporal fossa. The parietal (posterior) margin is thick, deeply serrated, and bevelled internally above and externally below.

The anterior portion of the falx cerebri is attached to the margins of the sulcus and to the frontal crest.

The region ends in a sharp nasal spine, on each side of which a small grooved surface partly roofs the ipsilateral nasal cavity.

Inferior to its lateral margins, the bone articulates with the labyrinths of the ethmoid bone, and impressions of the ethmoidal air cells can be seen on this surface. Two transverse grooves across each margin are converted into anterior and posterior ethmoidal canals by articulation with the ethmoid bone; these canals open on the medial orbital wall and transmit the anterior and posterior ethmoidal nerves and vessels.

They are separated by a thin septum and usually deflected from the median plane, so that they are rarely symmetric. The sinuses are variable in size and usually larger in males. Their openings lie anterior to the ethmoidal notch and lateral to the nasal spine, and each communicates with the middle meatus in the ipsilateral nasal cavity by a frontonasal canal.</div><div class="text" id="p0215">The frontal sinuses are rudimentary at birth and can barely be distinguished. They show a primary expansion with eruption of the first deciduous molars at about 18 months, and again when the permanent molars begin to appear in the sixth year. Growth is slow in the early years but it can be detected radiographically by 6 years. They reach full size after puberty, although, with advancing age, osseous absorption may lead to further enlargement. Their degree of development appears to be linked to the prominence of the superciliary arches, which is thought to be a response to masticatory stresses.

A thick, smooth, triangular, median process, the crista galli, projects upwards from the centre of the cribriform plate. The falx cerebri is attached to its thin and curved posterior border, while its shorter, thick, anterior border articulates with the frontal bone by two small alae, so completing the foramen caecum. Its sides are generally smooth but may show slight bulges that are related to underlying ethmoidal air cells. On both sides of the crista galli, the cribriform plate is narrow and depressed, and is related to the gyrus rectus and the olfactory bulb that lie above it. On each side of the crista anteriorly, there is a small slit occupied by dura mater. Just anterolateral to the slit, a foramen transmits the anterior ethmoidal nerve and vessels to the nasal cavity. A groove runs forwards to the foramen caecum from the anterior ethmoidal canal.</div></section><section><a id="s0155"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0165">Perpendicular plate</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0235">The perpendicular plate is thin, flat, quadrilateral and median.

Its anterior border articulates with the nasal spine of the frontal bone and the crests of the nasal bones, and its posterior border articulates with the crest of the body of the sphenoid bone above and the vomer below. The thick inferior border is attached to the nasal septal cartilage.

The lateral surface (orbital plate) of the labyrinth is part of the medial orbital wall. The air cells are arranged in anterior and posterior groups separated by the basal lamella (the lateral attachment of the middle concha (turbinate) to the lamina papyracea). Historically the ethmoidal air cells sinuses were subdivided into anterior, middle and posterior ethmoidal air cells, but the nomenclature was inconsistent and confusing, and for clinical purposes, the middle group was incorporated into the anterior group (<a href="#bib30" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_30">Stammberger and Kennedy 1995</a>) (<a href="../B9780702077050000392/B9780702077050000392.xhtml">Ch. 39</a>). On average, there are 11 anterior ethmoidal air cells, and 7 posterior. In the disarticulated bone, many air cells are open, but in life, and in the articulated skull, they are closed by proximity to adjoining bones, except where they open into the nasal cavity. The superior surface is crossed by two grooves that are converted into the anterior and posterior ethmoidal canals by the frontal bone and shows open air cells that are covered by the edges of the ethmoidal notch of the frontal bone. On the posterior surface, open air cells are covered by the sphenoidal conchae and the orbital process of the palatine bone. The posterior ethmoidal air cells are covered by a thin, smooth, oblong orbital plate that articulates superiorly with the orbital plate of the frontal bone, inferiorly with the maxilla and orbital process of the palatine bone, anteriorly with the lacrimal bone, and posteriorly with the sphenoid bone.

Superiorly, the surface contains numerous vertical grooves that transmit bundles of olfactory nerves. Posteriorly, it is divided by the narrow, oblique superior meatus, bounded above by the thin, curved superior nasal concha. Posterior ethmoidal air cells open into the superior meatus. The convex surface of the middle nasal concha extends along the entire medial surface of the labyrinth, anteroinferior to the superior meatus. Its lower edge is thick, and its lateral surface is concave and forms part of the middle meatus. The ethmoidal bulla (bulla ethmoidalis) consists of a group of the largest and least variable anterior ethmoidal cells on the lateral wall of the middle meatus, and opens into the meatus, either on the bulla or above it. A curved infundibulum extends up and forwards from the middle meatus and communicates with the anterior ethmoidal sinuses.

A slip of orbicularis oris is attached to the alveolar border below this fossa, and nasalis is attached superolateral to it. Lateral to the incisive fossa is a larger, deeper canine fossa; levator anguli oris is attached to the bone of this fossa. The incisive and canine fossae are separated by the canine eminence overlying the socket of the canine tooth. The infraorbital foramen lies above the fossa and transmits the infraorbital vessels and nerve. Above the foramen, a sharp border separates the anterior and orbital surfaces of the bone and contributes to the infraorbital margin. Levator labii superioris is attached here above the infraorbital foramen and levator anguli oris is attached below it.

Posteroinferior is the maxillary tuberosity, roughened superomedially where it articulates with the pyramidal process of the palatine bone. A few fibres of medial pterygoid are attached here.

Its posterior border is smoothly rounded and forms most of the anterior edge of the inferior orbital fissure. The infraorbital groove lies centrally. The anterior border is part of the orbital margin and it articulates medially with the lacrimal crest of the frontal process of the maxilla. The infraorbital groove transmits the infraorbital vessels and nerve, and begins midway on the posterior border, where it is continuous with a groove on the posterior surface. It passes forwards into the infraorbital canal, which opens on the anterior surface below the infraorbital margin. Near its midpoint, the infraorbital canal gives off a small lateral branch, the canalis sinuosus, that transmits the anterior superior alveolar nerve and vessels. The canalis sinuosus descends in the orbital floor lateral to the infraorbital canal, curves medially in the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus, and then passes below the infraorbital foramen to the margin of the anterior nasal aperture in front of the anterior end of the inferior concha. It follows the lower margin of the aperture and opens near the nasal septum in front of the incisive canal.

This surface is traversed by a groove that descends forwards from the mid-posterior border and is converted into a greater palatine canal by the perpendicular plate. Anterior to the hiatus, a deep nasolacrimal groove, continuous above with the lacrimal groove, makes up about two-thirds of the circumference of the nasolacrimal canal. The rest is contributed by the descending part of the lacrimal bone and the lacrimal process of the inferior nasal concha. The nasolacrimal canal conveys the nasolacrimal duct to the inferior meatus.

It forms a large part of the nasal floor and hard palate and is much thicker anteriorly. Its inferior surface is concave and uneven, and with its contralateral fellow it forms the anterior three-quarters of the osseous (hard) palate. The palatine process displays numerous vascular foramina and depressions for palatine glands; posterolaterally, two grooves transmit the greater palatine vessels and nerves. The infundibular incisive fossa is placed between the two maxillae, behind the incisor teeth. The median intermaxillary palatal suture runs posterior to the fossa, and although a little uneven, is usually relatively flat on its oral aspect. Its bony margins are sometimes raised into a prominent longitudinal palatine torus. Two lateral incisive canals, each ascending into its half of the nasal cavity, open in the incisive fossa and transmit the terminations of the greater palatine artery and nasopalatine nerve. Two additional median openings, anterior and posterior incisive foramina, are occasionally present; they transmit the nasopalatine nerves, the left nerve usually passes through the anterior foramen, and the right nerve usually passes through the posterior foramen. On the inferior palatine surface, a fine groove (the incisive suture), extending anterolaterally from the incisive fossa to the interval between the lateral incisor and canine teeth, is prominent in young skulls and can be observed in adult skulls. The superior surface of the palatine process is smooth and concave transversely, and forms most of the nasal floor. The incisive canal lies anteriorly, near its median margin. The lateral border is continuous with the body of the maxilla. The medial border, thicker anteriorly, is raised into a nasal crest that, with its contralateral fellow, forms a groove for the vomer. Anteriorly, this ridge rises higher as an incisor crest, prolonged forwards into a sharp process that, with its fellow, forms an anterior nasal spine.

However, this deficiency is soon ossified, and there is no evidence of a separate centre of ossification for the incisor-bearing portion of the maxilla (premaxilla).</div><div class="text" id="p0390">The maxillary sinus appears as a shallow groove on the nasal aspect at about postmenstrual weeks 13–16. Though small at birth, the sinus is identifiable radiologically. After birth, it enlarges with the growing maxilla, though it is only fully developed following the eruption of the permanent dentition. The infraorbital vessels and nerve are, for a time, in an open groove in the orbital floor; the anterior part of the groove is subsequently converted into a canal by a lamina that grows in from the lateral side.</div><div class="text" id="p0395">At birth, the transverse and sagittal maxillary dimensions are greater than the vertical. The frontal process is prominent, but the body is little more than an alveolar process because the alveoli reach almost to the orbital floor.

Both soft and hard tissues are affected. Moderate to severe injuries produce facial skeletal disruption that compromises masticatory and orbital function. Inadequate skeletal support of soft tissues contributes to facial asymmetry and the additional loss of soft tissues and subsequent scarring merely compound this. Some fractures pass through foramina, damage branches of the trigeminal nerve and result in sensory deficits. Fracture configurations vary according to the amount of energy absorbed and local anatomical factors that constitute sites of weakness. The direction and magnitude of the applied forces determine the displacement of these fractures, which are modified according to muscle attachments and the state of the dentition, e.g. an unerupted mandibular third molar may produce a weak point at the mandibular angle.</div><div class="text" id="p0455">Lateral pterygoid frequently displaces a fractured mandibular condyle medially. Masseter, temporalis and medial pterygoid can stabilize fractures of the mandible when vertically or horizontally favourable, but displace those that are vertically and horizontally unfavourable. Severe injuries to the middle third of the face may result in craniofacial dysjunction, the middle third sliding inferiorly down the angulated and strong anterior skull base, causing an apparent lengthening of the face and a dish-faced appearance. Airway obstruction may result from this downward and backward displacement. Fractures of the anterior mandible may cause loss of support of the muscles controlling the anterior tongue position and may also contribute to loss of the airway.</div><div class="text" id="p0460">Although the fractures caused by severe injuries are often complex, it is convenient to describe them as arising in the upper, middle and lower thirds of the face, even though fractures may involve one or more of these areas. Upper third fractures involve the frontal bones. Middle third fractures involve the nasoethmoidal complex, orbit, zygomatic complex and maxilla. Lower third fractures correspond to fractures of the mandible.</div><section><a id="s0320"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0330">Upper third of face</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0475">Fractures in the upper third of the face are almost invariably comminuted and are often associated with fractures of the middle third of the face. Fractures of the frontal bone may involve the frontal sinuses and/or orbital roof. If the frontonasal duct is traumatized, its drainage may be impaired predisposing to ascending intracranial infection and mucocele development within the frontal sinuses (<a href="#bib5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_5">Eljamel and Foy 1990</a>; <a href="#f0105"><span class="bold">Fig. 36.10</span></a>). This risk may be minimized with frontonasal stents or frontonasal duct and frontal sinus obliteration with autogenous bone graft. Fractures that involve both the anterior and the posterior walls of the frontal sinus also carry a risk of early and delayed intracranial infection, and it is often necessary to obliterate the frontal sinuses or cranialize the frontal sinuses in order to prevent this complication. Cranialization of the frontal sinuses involves the removal of the posterior wall and all frontal sinus mucosa, typically through a frontal craniotomy approach. Fractures of the posterior wall of the frontal sinus may be associated with dural tears (and cerebrospinal rhinorrhoea) that must be repaired at the same time. Fractures involving the orbital roof may be associated with displacement of the globe of the eye, diplopia and supraorbital nerve injury.</div><div id="p9475"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0105"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000367/main.assets/on36-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0105"/><a id="fspara0105"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 36.10</span> An axial CT of a compound craniofacial fracture with disruption of the anterior and posterior walls of the frontal sinus, torn dura and intracranial bone.

Injuries to the maxillary or mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve or the chorda tympani nerve result in altered sensation to the oral cavity, face and jaws, including impaired taste. Fractures extending into the orbit may result in decreased visual acuity, ophthalmoplegia and neural damage to motor nerves. Direct damage to muscles may result in problems with chewing, swallowing, speech, middle ear function and eye movements. Injuries involving the pterygopalatine or otic ganglia interfere with lacrimation, nasal secretions and salivation. Facial deformity with lack of nasal projection, asymmetry and occlusal disturbance and vertical and anteroposterior malposition of the globe, are frequent outcomes of middle third fractures.</div><section><a id="s9335"/><section><a id="s0335"/><section><a id="s0340"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0345">Nasoethmoidal complex</p><div class="textfl" id="p0495">Fractures can involve the osteocartilaginous framework of the nose in isolation or as part of complex injuries that also involve the paranasal sinuses and/or the orbits (<a href="#f0110"><span class="bold">Fig. 36.11</span></a>).</div><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0110"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000367/main.assets/on36-02-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0110"/><a id="fspara0110"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 36.11</span> An extended naso-orbito-ethmoid (NOE) fracture.

The skeletal foundation of the nasoethmoidal complex consists of a strong triangular-shaped frame. However, all these structures are fragile and any force sufficient to fracture the frame results in severe comminution and displacement. The ethmoidal air cells act as a crumple zone protecting the cranial base from mechanical forces. A severe impact delivered to the midface, particularly over the bridge of the nose, may result in these structures being driven backwards between the orbits and may result in traumatic hypertelorism, producing an increase in distance between the pupils. Associated displacement of the medial canthal ligaments results in traumatic telecanthus. Increased intercanthal distance may be corrected using microplates, stainless steel wire and acrylic canthal splints. Damage to the lacrimal system requires approximation of the severed canalicular ends or dacryocystorhinostomy. Comminution of the cribriform plates of the ethmoid bone may result in dural tears and cerebrospinal rhinorrhoea.

From the base of the inferior orbital fissure the fracture runs laterally and upwards, separating the greater wing of the sphenoid from the zygomatic bone to reach the frontozygomatic suture. It also extends downwards and backwards across the pterygopalatine fossa to involve the root of the pterygoid plates.

The zygomatic bone forms the prominence of the cheek. Since the most common cause of a zygomatic fracture is a blow from a fist, depressed fractures of the zygomaticomaxillary complex are a common injury. These injuries may be sustained in isolation or in association with orbital blowout fractures. Isolated zygomatic arch fractures from a well-directed lateral blow are also common. Classic zygomatic complex fractures involve the zygomaticomaxillary, zygomaticotemporal, zygomaticofrontal and sphenozygomatic sutures. The fracture line extends from the lateral wall of the orbit laterally into the infratemporal fossa at the zygomaticofrontal suture. From this point, it extends inferiorly to join the most lateral aspect of the inferior orbital fissure and continues inferiorly along the posterior surface of the zygomatic buttress, where it communicates with the lateral bulge of the maxillary sinus (antrum). It then runs around the zygomatic buttress, high in the buccal sulcus in the upper molar region to extend upwards towards the infraorbital foramen. It finally runs laterally along the floor of the orbit to reach the lateral extension of the inferior orbital fissure.

Patients with zygomatic complex fractures must be advised to refrain from sneezing or nose-blowing, which may force air from the sinus into the surrounding tissues (surgical emphysema) or into the orbit, resulting in proptosis of the eye. While the zygoma may be reduced transorally (the Keen approach), or via the brow (Dingman approach), or a cheek-hook technique (Poswillo approach), it is perhaps the Gillies temporal approach that is worthy of mention here because it exploits the anatomy of the region (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Gillies et al 1927</a>). The incision is hidden in the hairline and the approach depends on the fact that the superior temporal fascia is attached to the superior temporal line of the skull superiorly and the zygomatic arch inferiorly, and that temporalis runs under the arch. An incision through the temporalis fascia, but not through the muscle, allows a metal elevator to be passed from the hairline to the zygomatic arch and body. Outward traction, coupled with rotation, allows precise localization of the bone.</div><section><a id="s0365"/><section><a id="s0370"/><section><a id="s0375"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0370">Orbital fractures</p><div class="textfl" id="p0535">The orbit is invariably involved in fractures of the zygomatic bone and in Le Fort II and III fractures and can also be involved in fractures of the frontal bone and extensive nasal complex injuries. Direct blunt trauma to the globe may result in displacement of the globe and fracture of the thin orbital floor (or medial wall) without associated rim involvement and is known as a ‘blowout’ fracture (<a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_1">Ahmas et al 2006</a>). This protective mechanism of injury helps to maintain the integrity of the globe in preference to the orbital walls. There may be associated herniation of periorbital fat (<a href="#f0130"><span class="bold">Fig. 36.15</span></a>) and/or inferior rectus, resulting in restriction of eye movement, diplopia, ipsilateral lowering of pupillary height, and enophthalmos (due to increased orbital volume) (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Manson et al 1986</a>). Fortunately, the optic foramen, situated within the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone, is surrounded by dense bone and is only rarely involved in fractures, which means that direct injury to the optic nerve is unusual.

This basic configuration is modified by sites of muscle attachment, principally masseter and medial pterygoid at the angle, and temporalis at the coronoid process. The presence of teeth, particularly those with long roots such as the canines, or of unerupted teeth, produces lines of weakness in the mandible. When the teeth are lost or fail to develop, the subsequent progressive resorption of the alveolar bone means that the mandible reverts to its underlying tubular structure. Like all tubular bones, the strength of the mandible resides in a dense cortical plate, thickened anteriorly and at its lower border, which means that the mandible is strongest anteriorly in the midline and is progressively weaker posteriorly towards the condylar processes. Again, like all tubular bones, the mandible has great resistance to compressive forces, but it fractures at sites of tensile strain. The mandible is liable to particular patterns of distribution of tensile strain when forces are applied to it. Anterior forces applied to the mental symphysis, or over the body of the mandible, lead to strain at the condylar necks and also along the lingual cortical plates on the contralateral side in the molar region. The mandible therefore often fractures at two sites and isolated fractures are relatively unusual. In order of frequency, fractures most commonly involve the neck of the condyle, the angle, the parasymphysial region and the body of the mandible.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s10380"/><section><a id="s20380"/><section><a id="s30380"/><section><a id="s0380"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0375">Condylar process</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0545">The condyle is protected from direct injury by the zygomatic arches.

Except in children, most condylar fractures are not intracapsular but are sustained at the neck and usually run obliquely downwards and backwards from the mandibular notch. The condyle is usually displaced anteromedially (because of the attachment of lateral pterygoid to the temporomandibular joint disc, capsule and anterior border of the neck of the condyle).

They result in bleeding in the floor of the middle cranial fossa, which often presents as bruising over the mastoid process (Battle’s sign).

The osteotomy is completed by dividing the upper alveolus and palate just to the side of the nasal septum and perpendicular plate of the vomer.

By extending the dissection laterally, access is gained to the pterygoid space, infratemporal fossa and parapharyngeal space. By dissecting more medially, access is gained to the nasopharynx, lower part of the clivus and all seven of the cervical vertebrae.

It has orbital, palpebral and lacrimal parts, and a small ciliary bundle.</div><div class="text" id="p0680">The orbital part arises from the nasal component of the frontal bone, the frontal process of the maxilla and from the medial palpebral ligament. The fibres form complete ellipses, without interruption on the lateral side, where there is no bony attachment. The upper orbital fibres blend with the frontal part of occipitofrontalis and corrugator supercilii. Many of them are inserted into the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the eyebrow and constitute depressor supercilii. Inferiorly and medially, the ellipses overlap or blend to some extent with adjacent muscles (levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, levator labii superioris and zygomaticus minor).

A small group of fine fibres, close to the margin of each eyelid behind the eyelashes, constitutes the ciliary bundle.</div><div class="text" id="p0690">The lacrimal part arises from the upper part of the lacrimal crest and the adjacent lateral surface of the lacrimal bone. It passes laterally behind the nasolacrimal sac (where some fibres are inserted into the associated fascia) and divides into upper and lower slips.

Contraction of the upper orbital fibres produces vertical furrowing above the bridge of the nose, narrowing of the palpebral fissure, and bunching and protrusion of the eyebrows, which reduces the amount of light entering the eyes. Eye closure is largely affected by lowering of the upper eyelid but there is also considerable elevation of the lower eyelid. The palpebral portion can be contracted voluntarily, to close the lids gently as in sleep, or reflexively, to close the lids protectively in blinking. The palpebral part has upper depressor and lower elevator fascicles. The lacrimal part of the muscle draws the eyelids and the lacrimal papillae medially, thereby exerting traction on the lacrimal fascia, and may aid drainage of tears by dilating the lacrimal sac. It may also influence pressure gradients within the lacrimal gland and ducts. This activity may assist in the sinuous flow of tears across the cornea, direct the lacrimal punctum into the lacus lacrimalis, and express secretions of the ciliary and tarsal glands. When the entire orbicularis oculi muscle contracts, the skin is thrown into folds that radiate from the lateral angle of the eyelids. Such folds, when permanent, cause wrinkles (often called ‘crow’s feet’).</div>

In fact, orbicularis oris consists of four substantially independent quadrants (upper, lower, left and right), each containing a larger pars peripheralis and a smaller pars marginalis that are apposed along lines that correspond externally to the lines of junction between the vermilion zone of the lip and the skin. Orbicularis oris is therefore composed of eight segments that are named systematically according to their location. Each segment resembles a fan that has its stem at the modiolus and is open in peripheral segments and almost closed in marginal segments.</div><section><a id="s0830"/><h6 class="h5hd" id="cesectitle0705">Pars peripheralis</h6><div class="textfl" id="p0925">In each quadrant, the pars peripheralis has a lateral stem attached to the labial side of the modiolus over its full thickness, from apex to base, including the corresponding upper or lower cornu. Most of these stem fibres are thought to originate within the modiolus (although it is possible that some are direct continuations from the other modiolar muscles). They are reinforced directly by fibres from buccinator (upper fibres and decussating lower central fibres), levator anguli oris and the superficial part of zygomaticus major in the upper lip, and from buccinator (lower fibres and decussating upper central fibres) and depressor anguli oris in the lower lip.</div><div class="text" id="p0930">The fibres of orbicularis oris enter their respective superior and inferior labial areas and diverge to form triangular muscular sheets. These are thickest at the junctions between skin and the vermilion zone and become progressively thinner as they reach the limits of the labial region. The greater part of each sheet enters the free lip, where its fibres aggregate into cylindrical bundles orientated parallel to the vermilion zone. Fibres of the direct labial tractors pass to their submucosal attachments between these cylindrical bundles and between the pars peripheralis and pars marginalis. In the upper lip, the highest fibres run near the nasolabial sulcus, a few fibres attach to the sulcus, and a few to the nasal ala and septum. In the lower lip, the lowest fibres reach and are attached to the mentolabial sulcus. A small proportion of the main body of fibres is thought to end in the labial connective tissue, dermis or submucosa as it traverses its quadrant of free lip. Most fibres continue towards the median plane and cross some 5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm into the opposite half-lip.

In each quadrant, the pars marginalis consists of a single (occasionally double) band of thin muscle fibres lodged within the tissues of each vermilion zone. At their medial end, <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="626" id="pagebreak_626"/><a id="pg626"/>the marginal fibres meet and interlace with their contralateral fellows and are then attached to the dermis of the vermilion zone a few millimetres beyond the median plane in a manner similar to pars peripheralis. At their lateral ends, the fibres converge and are attached to the deepest part of the modiolar base along a horizontal strip level with the angle of the mouth.</div><div class="text" id="p0940">The relations between the pars marginalis and pars peripheralis are complex. In a full-thickness section of an upper lip at right-angles to the vermilion zone, the cylindrical bundles of the fibres of the pars peripheralis form an S shape, with an external convexity above and an internal convexity below: the classic analogy being to the shank and initial curved part of a hook. Beyond the pars peripheralis, the hook shape is completed by the blunted triangular profile of the pars marginalis that occupies the core of the vermilion zone with its base adjacent to the pars peripheralis and its apex reaching upwards and anteriorly towards the junction between the vermilion zone and the skin. In a similar section through the lower lip, the bundles of the pars peripheralis form a continuous curve that is concave towards the external surface. This is surmounted by the flattened triangular profile of the pars marginalis that curves anteriorly, its apex again nearing the vermilion/cutaneous junction. Thus, throughout the vermilion zones of both lips, the pars marginalis lies substantially anterior to the adjacent bundles of the pars peripheralis. However, as the muscles are traced laterally beyond the vermilion zone and across the angle of the mouth, this relationship alters. The pars marginalis becomes inverted as it wraps progressively around the adjacent edge of the pars peripheralis to reach its deep (submucosal) surface and maintains this position up to its attachment at the modiolar base.</div><section><a id="s0840"/><section><a id="s0845"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0715">Vascular supply</p><div class="textfl" id="p0945">Orbicularis oris is supplied mainly by the superior and inferior labial branches of the facial artery, the mental and infraorbital branches of the maxillary artery, and the transverse facial branch of the superficial temporal artery.</div></section><section><a id="s0850"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0720">Nerve supply</p><div class="textfl" id="p0950">Orbicularis oris is supplied by the buccal and mandibular branches of the facial nerve.</div></section><section><a id="s0855"/><p class="h7hd" id="cesectitle0725">Actions</p><div class="textfl" id="p0955">The actions of orbicularis oris are considered in detail in the next section.</div></section></section></section></section><section><a id="s0860"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0730">Incisivus labii superioris</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0960">Incisivus labii superioris has a bony origin from the floor of the incisive fossa of the maxilla above the eminence of the lateral incisor tooth.

The remainder continue deep to depressor anguli oris and reappear at its medial border. Here, they continue within the tissue of the lateral half of the lower lip, as a direct labial tractor, platysma pars labialis. Pars labialis occupies the interval between depressor anguli oris and depressor labii inferioris and is in the same plane as these muscles. The adjacent margins of all three muscles blend and they have similar labial attachments. Platysma pars modiolaris constitutes all the remaining bundles posterior to pars labialis, other than a few fine fascicles that end directly in buccal dermis or submucosa.

In broad terms, the force exerted by tractors is directed vertically at an approximate right-angle to the oral fissure. Their action will therefore elevate and/or evert the whole, or part, of the upper lip and depress and/or evert the whole, or part, of the lower lip. The tractors are, from medial to lateral, the labial part of levator labii superioris alaeque nasi; levator labii superioris and zygomaticus minor in the upper lip; and depressor labii inferioris and platysma pars labialis in the lower lip.</div><div class="text" id="p1000">In both upper and lower lips, the tractors blend into a continuous sheet that divides into a series of superimposed coronal sheets anterior to the muscle bundles of orbicularis oris pars peripheralis as they enter the free lip. The sheets may be divided into three groups at increasing depths from the skin surface, each with a distinct zone of attachment (<a href="#f0065"><span class="bold">Fig. 36.19</span></a>). The superficial group consists of a succession of bundles of fine fibres that curve anteriorly a short distance before being attached in a series of horizontal rows to the dermis between the hair follicles, sebaceous glands and sweat glands. The intermediate group is attached to the dermis of the vermilion zone that they reach by two routes. The more superficial bundles continue past the skin/vermilion junction, then curve posteriorly over orbicularis oris pars marginalis to punctate attachments on the ventral half of the dermis of the vermilion zone. The deeper bundles first pass posteriorly between pars peripheralis and pars marginalis of orbicularis oris, then curve anteriorly to punctate attachments on the dorsal half of the dermis of the vermilion zone. The deep group is closely applied to the anterior surface of orbicularis oris pars peripheralis and sends fine tractor fibres between its parallel bundles to be attached posteriorly into the submucosa and periglandular connective tissue.<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="627" id="pagebreak_627"/><a id="pg627"/></div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0065"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000367/main.assets/f36-12-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0065"/><a id="fspara0065"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 36.19</span> <span class="bold">A</span>, Sagittal section of the upper lip in repose.

For example, partial contraction of the superior labial tractors can result in localized elevation of a segment of the upper lip, in a postural expression reminiscent of the ‘canine snarl’. Normally, the activity of the tractors is modified by the superimposed activity of orbicularis oris and the modiolar muscles: the resulting actions range from delicate adjustments of the tension and profile of the lip margins to large increases of the oral fissure with eversion of the lips.</div><div class="text" id="p1010">Lip protrusion is passive in its initial stages. It may be suppressed by powerful contraction of the whole of orbicularis oris or enhanced by selective activation of parts of the direct labial tractors. However, lip movements must accommodate separation of the teeth brought about by mandibular depression at the temporomandibular joints. Beyond a certain range of mouth opening, labial movements are almost completely dominated by mandibular movements. Thus, over the last 2.5–3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm inter-incisal distance of wide jaw separation, strong contraction of orbicularis oris cannot effect lip contact. Instead it causes full-thickness inflection of the upper and lower lips, including the vermilion zone, towards the oral cavity, wrapping them around the incisal edges, canine cusps and premolar occlusal surfaces. The involvement of the lips in speech is described in <a href="../B9780702077050000410/B9780702077050000410.xhtml">Chapter 41</a>, but some aspects relevant to the actions of orbicularis oris pars marginalis will be described here. Contraction of marginalis is considered to alter the cross-sectional profile of the free margin of the vermilion zone such that both the gentle bulbous profile of the upper lip and the smooth posterosuperior convexity of the lower lip change to a narrow, symmetric, triangular profile. The transformed rims, whose length and tension can be delicately controlled, have been named labial cords and are known to be involved in the production of some consonantal (labial) sounds. A labial cord may also function as a ‘vibrating reed’ in whistling or playing a wind instrument such as the trumpet.</div></section><section><a id="s0925"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0780">The modiolus and its role in facial movements</h5><div class="textfl" id="p1015">On each side of the face, a number of muscles converge towards a focus just lateral to the angle of the mouth where they interlace to form a dense, compact, mobile, fibromuscular mass called the modiolus. This can be palpated most effectively by using the opposed thumb and index finger to compress the mucosa and skin simultaneously. At least nine muscles, depending on the classification employed, are attached to each modiolus. The muscles lie in different planes, their modiolar stems are often spiralized, and most divide into two bundles, some into three or four, each of them interlacing and attaching in a distinctive way.</div><div class="text" id="p1020">The shape and dimensions of the modiolus are subject to individual, age, sexual and ethnic variation. There are no precise histological boundaries because the modiolus is an irregular zone where dense, compact, interlacing tissue grades into the stems of individually recognizable muscles. It has the rough form of a blunt cone that is approximately 10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm thick from mucosa to dermis, divided approximately equally into basal, central and apical parts. The base is roughly elliptical in outline, extending vertically 20<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm above and 20<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm below a horizontal line through the angle of the mouth and laterally a similar distance from the angle. The blunt apex of the cone is 4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm across, centred approximately 12<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm lateral to the angle of the mouth. The central body has an oblique fibrous cleft or channel that transmits the facial artery, an arrangement that may limit the extent to which it is compressed by contraction of the buccolabial musculature. The cone shape is modified by two round-edged flanges (cornua) that extend into the lateral free lip tissues above and below the angle of the mouth.</div><div class="text" id="p1025">Controlled three-dimensional mobility of the modioli enables them to integrate the activities of the cheeks, lips and oral fissure, the oral vestibule and the jaws. Such activities include biting, chewing, drinking, sucking, swallowing, changes in vestibular contents and pressure, the innumerable subtle variations involved in speech, the modulation (and occasional generation) of musical tones, production of harsher sounds in shouting and screaming, crying, and all the permutations of facial expression, ranging from mere hints to gross distortion, symmetric or asymmetric. Major modiolar movements appear to involve many, if not all, of its associated muscles, and there is little value in considering the actions of the individual muscles in isolation. While the most obvious determinant of modiolar position and mobility is the balance between the forces exerted by muscles that are directly attached to it, another influential factor is the degree of separation or ‘gape’ between the upper and lower teeth. Starting from the occlusal position, and with the lips maintained in contact, the teeth can be separated by approximately 1.25<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm near the midline, and the mentolabial sulcus descends by a similar distance. With further separation, the lips part, and as gape increases to its maximum, interlabial and interdental distances approach 4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm, at which point the mentolabial sulcus has descended a further 2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm. In this posture, the modiolus has descended about 1 cm to lie over the interdental space, into which its basal and surrounding buccal mucosa projects a few millimetres, and its cornua diverge into their respective lips at an obtuse angle to each other, the dispositions of the modiolar muscles being correspondingly modified. The general hexagonal shape of the labial area changes as the mouth and jaws open progressively. In maximal opening, the distance between the superior and inferior boundaries has increased by 3–3.5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm at the centre; the transverse distance between its lateral angles has decreased by 1<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm and the angles are obtuse; the nasolabial sulci are longer, straighter and more vertical; and the inferior buccolabial sulci are less deep and curved. These soft tissue changes radiate from the bilateral modioli.</div><div class="text" id="p1030">With the lips in contact and the teeth in tight occlusion, the modiolus can move a few millimetres in all directions. However, mobility is maximal when there is 2–3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm clearance between the teeth: the apex of the modiolus may then move vertically upwards 10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm, downwards 5<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm, posterolaterally 10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm, and anteromedially 10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm, these movements being accomplished in the curved planes of the cheek and lips. Specific movements of the modiolus may take place at any point, and along any path, within the boundaries of the envelope of movement thus defined. When the mouth is opened wide, the modiolus becomes immobile. From the neutral position, the modiolus may be displaced superficially along its apicobasal axis for up to 5–10<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm by liquids or solids in the vestibule, or by an increase in air pressure that ‘balloons’ the cheeks and lips.</div><div class="text" id="p1035">Many activities take place in three phases. Initially, a particular modiolar muscle group becomes dominant over its antagonists and the modiolus is rapidly relocated. Next, the modiolus is transiently fixed in this new site by simultaneous contraction of modiolar muscles, principally zygomaticus major, levator anguli oris, depressor anguli oris and platysma pars modiolaris, and this provides a fixed base from which the main physiological effectors, buccinator and orbicularis oris, carry out their specific actions. These actions are usually integrated with partial separation or closure of the jaws, and with varying degrees of activity in the direct labial tractors. All these factors combine to determine the positions of the lips and oral fissure from moment to moment. Modiolar movements may be bilaterally symmetric, unilateral or asymmetric.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0930"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0785">Muscles of mastication</h3><div class="textfl" id="p1040">Masseter and temporalis, two of the muscles of mastication, are seen on the face.

Within the substance of the gland, it branches into superior (temporofacial) and inferior (cervicofacial) trunks, usually just behind and superficial to the retromandibular vein. The trunks branch further to form a parotid plexus (pes anserinus). Five main terminal branches arise from the plexus, diverge within the gland and leave by its anteromedial surface, medial to its anterior margin, to supply the muscles of facial expression (see <a href="#f0085">Fig. 36.23</a>). Six distinctive anastomotic patterns were originally classified by <a href="#bib4" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_4">Davis et al (1956)</a> and these are illustrated in <a href="#f0090"><span class="bold">Fig. 36.24</span></a>. Numerous microdissection studies have demonstrated considerable individual variation in branching patterns and anastomoses between branches, both within the parotid and on the face (e.g. <a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Lineaweaver et al 1997</a>, <a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Kwak et al 2004</a>): the account that follows is therefore an overview.

Upper deep branches supply zygomaticus major and levator labii superioris and form an infraorbital plexus with the superior labial branches of the infraorbital nerve. They also supply levator anguli oris, zygomaticus minor, levator labii superioris alaeque nasi and the small nasal muscles (these branches are sometimes described as lower zygomatic branches).

Lower motor neurone facial paralysis is most commonly idiopathic (Bell’s palsy). There are a large number of other recognized causes that include geniculate herpes zoster (Ramsay Hunt syndrome), malignant tumours of the parotid gland and temporal bone.

The gland also projects forwards onto the surface of masseter (<a href="#f0085"><span class="bold">Fig. 36.23B</span></a>). Sometimes, a small and often detached part called the accessory parotid gland (pars accessoria or socia parotidis) lies between the zygomatic arch above and the parotid duct below (<a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_10">Fromer 1977</a>). The overall shape of the parotid gland is variable. Viewed laterally, it is often roughly triangular in outline, whereas other glands are more or less of even width throughout with rounded upper and lower poles.</div><div class="text" id="p1380">In its usual inverted pyramidal form, the parotid gland presents superior, superficial, anteromedial and posteromedial surfaces and tapers inferiorly to a blunt apex. The small concave superior surface is related to the cartilaginous part of the external acoustic meatus and posterior aspect of the temporomandibular joint. Here, the auriculotemporal nerve curves round the neck of the mandible, embedded in the parotid capsule. The apex overlaps the posterior belly of digastric and the carotid triangle to a variable extent. The superficial surface is covered by skin and superficial fascia that contains the facial branches of the great auricular nerve, superficial parotid lymph nodes and the posterior border of platysma. It extends upwards to the zygomatic arch, backwards to overlap sternocleidomastoid, downwards to its apex posteroinferior to the mandibular angle, and forwards to lie on masseter below the parotid duct. The anteromedial surface is grooved by the posterior border of the mandibular ramus. It covers the posteroinferior part of masseter, the lateral aspect of the temporomandibular joint and the adjoining part of the mandibular ramus. It passes forwards, medial to the ramus of the mandible, to reach medial pterygoid. The gland may therefore be subdivided into a larger superficial part and a smaller part, the deep ‘lobe’, deep to the ramus, the two being joined by an isthmus. Branches of the facial nerve emerge on the face from the anterior margin of this surface.</div><div class="text" id="p1385">The posteromedial surface is moulded to the mastoid process, sternocleidomastoid, posterior belly of the digastric, and the styloid process and its associated muscles. The external carotid artery grooves this surface before entering the gland, and the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein are separated from the gland by the styloid process and its associated muscles (<a href="#f0095"><span class="bold">Fig. 36.25</span></a>).

The external carotid artery enters the posteromedial surface and divides into the maxillary artery, which emerges from the anteromedial surface, and the superficial temporal artery, which gives off its transverse facial branch in the gland and ascends to leave its upper limit (see <a href="#f0085">Fig. 36.23</a>).

Acute inflammation of the parotid gland (acute sialadenitis) may cause exquisite pain in the pre-auricular region as a result of capsular stretch and stimulation of the great auricular nerve. The pain is usually exacerbated at mealtimes when the gustatory stimulus to the gland results in further turgor within the capsule.

The duct begins by the confluence of two main tributaries within the anterior part of the parotid gland.

If the duct arises lower down, it may run obliquely upwards. It crosses masseter, turning medially at its anterior border at almost a right angle, and traverses the buccal fat pad and buccinator opposite the crown of the maxillary third molar tooth. The duct then runs obliquely forwards for a short distance between buccinator and the oral mucosa before it opens on a small papilla opposite the crown of the maxillary second molar tooth. The submucosal passage of the duct serves as a valvular mechanism, preventing inflation of the gland with raised intraoral pressures. While crossing masseter, the duct lies between the upper and lower buccal branches of the facial nerve and may receive the accessory parotid duct.</div><div class="text" id="p1415">The accessory part of the gland (<a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Fromer 1977</a>) and the transverse facial artery lie above the parotid duct; the buccal branch of the mandibular nerve, emerging from beneath temporalis and masseter, lies just below, at the anterior border of masseter.
