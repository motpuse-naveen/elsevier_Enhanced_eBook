Each year, in the United Kingdom, there are approximately 40,000 new cases diagnosed and 14,000 deaths. Male breast cancers constitute up to 1% of all mammary malignancies and may include tissue beyond the areolar boundary.</div><div class="text" id="p0015">Breast cancers arise within the epithelia of lobules or ducts. As they increase in size and become invasive, they often lead to a fibrous stromal tissue reaction. Breast lumps may be classified as benign or malignant masses. More advanced malignant breast lumps (carcinomas) may have the clinical signs of infiltrating adjacent structures, leading to a hard and irregular mass with skin-tethering, muscle fixation, skin infiltration or oedema of the overlying skin (<span class="italic">peau d’orange</span>). Standard radiological imaging investigations of the breast include mammography and ultrasonography. Mammography is useful in detecting the presence of malignant masses as a stellate opacity with architectural distortion of the surrounding parenchyma. Preinvasive breast cancer, e.g. ductal carcinoma <span class="italic">in situ</span>, may appear as microcalcifications on the mammogram. An ultrasound scan of the breast is helpful to distinguish solid from cystic (fluid-filled) masses, and can also aid in the distinction of breast cancer from benign lumps by the different attenuation characteristics of the ultrasound waves and blood-flow patterns. Ultrasound may also be useful in guiding core biopsy.</div><div class="text" id="p0020">A strong association between increased mammographic breast density and risk of breast cancer has been shown repeatedly. Breast density is assessed by mammograms where the appearance of the fibroglandular tissue is dense or white and the adipose tissue is less dense or grey. The fibroglandular tissue is comprised of epithelial cells, fibroblasts and connective tissue. Several scales of categorization of breast density have been devised. Wolfe was the first to introduce mammographic categorization of four mammographic patterns (<a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_22">Wolfe et al 1976a</a>, <a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">1976b</a>). Since then, in an effort to increase reproducibility of assessment of mammographic density, a number of methods have been devised comprising five or six categories. By the 1990s computerized measurements of mammograms were developed to calculate both total and percentage mammographic density. The computerized method has also been shown to be predictive of breast cancer risk. In general, there is high reproducibility and consistency between the scales, especially identification of women with high mammographic density (<a href="#bib7" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_7">Garrido-Estepa et al 2010</a>). Mammographic density appears to be influenced by a number of factors, including somatotype, BMI at 18 years of age, history of biopsy-confirmed benign breast disease (for both pre- and postmenopausal women) and hormone replacement therapy. It should be noted that premenopausal women’s breasts are more mammographically dense due to the increased fraction of glandular and collagenous tissue present prior to postmenopausal involution. Given that the majority of breast malignancies are also radio-dense, this limits the effectiveness (as measured by the reduction in breast cancer mortality) of mammographic screening in premenopausal women. Breast cancer rates increase in 40- to 49-year-old women compared to those less than 40 years of age. These statistics may prompt clinicians to consider screening high-risk women and also incorporate supplementary imaging such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging in those with high breast density.</div><div class="text" id="p0025">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful in diagnosis, particularly in women with younger, denser breasts, achieving higher sensitivity of breast cancer detection but with lower specificity. A cytological diagnosis of a breast lump can be achieved using fine-needle aspiration (FNA) to evaluate the cellular component of a lump. FNA is also useful to drain symptomatic breast cysts. A wide-bore needle biopsy is a procedure performed under local anaesthetic to obtain several pieces of specimen for a histological diagnosis with the tissue architecture maintained. This permits distinction between <span class="italic">in situ</span> and invasive cancer, and provides an indication of tumour subtype by evaluation of the pathological characteristics. Vacuum-assisted mammotome biopsies based on the wide-bore needle enable some benign and indeterminate lesions to be excised for full histological analysis and, in some patients, can avoid the need for conventional open surgery.</div><div class="text" id="p0030">If a breast lump has to be surgically removed, the incision should be based, whenever possible, in the relaxed skin tension lines, for the best cosmetic results. In women with sizeable malignant lesions in whom breast conservation surgery is to be attempted, the skin incision should be planned with consideration of the possible requirement for a subsequent mastectomy if the margins of excision are incompletely excised by pathological criteria (<a href="#bib20" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_20">Swanson et al 2002</a>). Most women with single breast cancers of up to 4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm in diameter are treated by breast conservation rather than mastectomy. This is a combination of surgery (tumour excision and sentinel node biopsy or clearance) together with external beam radiotherapy to minimize the risk of local recurrence. Patients with larger tumours are likely to be treated by mastectomy with axillary lymph node clearance. Neo-adjuvant endocrine or chemotherapy treatment prior to surgery may improve operability to allow breast conservation surgery of larger tumours.</div><div class="text" id="p0035">During axillary dissection to clear the axillary lymph nodes, the long thoracic nerve (to serratus anterior), the thoracodorsal vessels, the thoracodorsal nerve (to latissimus dorsi), and the medial and lateral pectoral nerves are all identified and carefully preserved. The boundaries of the axillary dissection are the long thoracic nerve medially, the thoracodorsal vascular pedicle laterally and the axillary vein superiorly. The posterior limit of the dissection is the anterior (ventral) surface of subscapularis. The superomedial limit of a level 1 axillary dissection extends to the lateral (inferolateral) border of pectoralis minor at the apex of the axilla; a level 2 dissection extends to the medial (superomedial) border of pectoralis minor; and a level 3 dissection extends beyond the medial border until it reaches the point where the axilla is limited by the first rib (the latter is easily distinguished by its flat superior surface, easily palpable at surgery). Failure to preserve the long thoracic nerve will result in lifting of the medial border of the scapula (winging) from the posterior thoracic wall and a reduced scapula protraction. The intercostobrachial nerve is often sacrificed in an axillary lymph node clearance operation, and this may result in anaesthesia of a narrow strip of skin along the upper medial border of the ipsilateral arm.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><section><a id="s0015"/><h2 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0010">Molecular breast cancer signatures</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0040">Mammary cell markers distinguish luminal from basal cells in the human breast. CK7, CK18 and Claudin-4 are expressed in luminal cells but not myopepithelial cells. CD10, SMA and p63 are expressed in myoepithelial cells but not luminal cells (<a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Santagata and Ince 2014</a>). Steroid hormone receptors are used in the classification of breast carcinomas. It remains clinically useful to classify carcinomas by the presence of the oestrogen receptor (ER+), progesterone receptor (PR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2+). Carcinomas not expressing any of these markers are referred to as triple-negative cancers (ER/PR/HER2<span>−</span>). Carcinomas expressing ER and PR are likely to respond to ER antagonists or aromatase inhibitors, blocking peripheral oestrogen production.</div><div class="text" id="p0045">More recently, technological advances, including gene expression microarrays and next-generation sequencing, have emphasized the diversity and heterogeneity of breast cancer and greatly expanded knowledge of breast cancer biology. Breast cancer is driven by alterations in DNA and epigenetic changes that activate or suppress growth genes and high-throughput technologies have led to a more detailed identification of an array of subtypes that allow more targeted treatment of the cancer. For example, multiple genes can be tested that allow discrimination of luminal ER-positive tumours into subgroups that have better or worse prognosis. Similarly, basal-like cancers are typically triple-negative (although not all triple-negative breast cancers are basal-like) and display upregulation of basal cell genes. Basal-like cancers can be divided into four subtypes. One subtype, in particular, shows upregulation of androgen receptor and has a relatively good prognosis (<a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Provenzano et al 2018</a>). Using a combination or both clinical variables and molecular subtyping is more predictive than any single measure alone (<a href="#bib11" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_11">Malhotra 2010</a>).</div><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="1.102001E6" id="pagebreak_1.102001E6"/></div></section><section><a id="s0020"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0015">Reconstructive surgery for breast cancer disease</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0050">Breast reconstruction may be performed at the time of mastectomy for breast cancer, or at a later stage (<a href="#bib19" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_19">Serletti and Moran 2000</a>). During a mastectomy where an immediate breast reconstruction is planned, the glandular breast tissue is removed either through a conventional mastectomy skin incision or in association with preservation of the native breast skin (skin-sparing mastectomy). Patient selection is important to minimize the risk of breast cancer recurrence in the skin of the reconstructed breast mound or associated lymph nodes. In an implant-based immediate breast reconstruction, a tissue expander is placed beneath the musculofascial plane consisting of pectoralis major, in continuity laterally under serratus anterior with the intervening fascia, and the abdominal fascia inferiorly. The lower fibres of the attachment of pectoralis major to the sixth rib need to be detached, otherwise the implant will be placed too high on the chest wall. The tissue expander has to stretch the potential space below this musculofascial plane to match the space created by the removed breast beneath the subcutaneous plane and the deep fascia overlying pectoralis major. The tissue expander is subsequently replaced by a silicone or saline breast implant.</div><div class="text" id="p0055">The skin and volume component of the breast can also be replaced by the latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap, with or without an underlying silicone or saline breast implant. Latissimus dorsi and an overlying paddle of skin are raised on its dominant vascular pedicle: namely, the thoracodorsal vessels, which enter the muscle on its deep surface and send perforating branches through the muscle to the overlying skin. The flap is transferred in an arc from the posterior to the anterior thorax and fashioned to make a new breast. An implant may be required to provide additional volume replacement, in which case it is placed beneath the flap. The donor site defect on the back is directly sutured. In selected cases, this flap can be raised with additional superficial fascia and fat, to avoid the need for a silicone implant. This is known as the extended or autologous latissimus dorsi flap.</div><div class="text" id="p0060">Women with a suitable abdominal panniculus may have breast reconstruction utilizing this tissue. Historically, this was achieved with a pedicled transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap based on the superior epigastric artery, where the skin and fat of the lower abdomen, attached to the rectus muscle, are transposed into the breast defect and shaped into a breast reconstruction.</div><div class="text" id="p0065">The development of microvascular techniques over the past 30 years has seen an increase in the popularity of free tissue transfers, based on the inferior epigastric artery (often termed by surgeons the deep inferior epigastric artery), including muscle-sparing (MS-)TRAM flaps and deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flaps. These flaps require dissection of the blood vessels within rectus abdominis, rather than sacrifice of the entire muscle, and this aims to reduce donor site morbidity, including hernias and bulging. Radiological investigations (CT angiograms, MRI and duplex) are used to determine the calibre and position of cutaneous perforator vessels within these flaps to improve the accuracy of dissection and enhance surgical outcome (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Fig. 7.1.1</span></a>). Free TRAM and DIEP flap vessels are anastomosed to recipient vessels in the thoracic region; the internal thoracic or the thoracodorsal artery are used most frequently for this purpose.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000938/main.assets/f93-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 7.1.1</span> A CT angiogram showing the deep inferior epigastric artery (red arrow) and a cutaneous perforating vessel (yellow arrow) emerging from the rectus sheath for MS-TRAM and DIEP flap reconstruction.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="text" id="p0070">Breast reconstruction using an autologous method, such as the extended latissimus dorsi, free MS-TRAM and DIEP flap, avoids the need for a silicone implant and has advantages in terms of producing a more natural appearance and achieving greater longevity of results.

The flap incorporated superficial fascia and a skin paddle attached to the muscle, and was used to replace part of the breast skin envelope that had been removed during the mastectomy. This form of breast reconstruction inexplicably fell out of regular use until the 1970s, when there was renewed interest in the latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap combined with silicone breast implants (<a href="#bib4" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_4">Bostwick et al 1977</a>, <a href="#bib17" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_17">Schneider et al 1978</a>) and improved definitions of the vascular supply and territory of the flap (<a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_13">McCraw et al 1977</a>, <a href="#bib12" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_12">Maxwell et al 1979</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0080">Later in the twentieth century, further developments of this most versatile flap meant that breast reconstruction could be performed without a silicone implant. The so-called ‘extended’ flap (<a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Hokin and Silfverskiold 1987</a>) used autologous tissues exclusively; it was designed to satisfy an increasing demand for breast reconstruction in an era when silicone implants were under scrutiny because of safety fears and proposed links with autoimmune diseases. Further developments to maximize the volume available for autologous reconstructions of small to medium-sized breasts included harvesting larger skin paddles from the back and burying them beneath the breast skin envelope after de-epithelializing their surface (<a href="#bib14" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_14">Papp et al 1988</a>), and inclusion of additional fat pads in the back to increase flap volume (<a href="#bib5" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_5">Delay et al 1998</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0085">Despite the enhancements to the latissimus dorsi flap, the lower abdominal region provides a plentiful and more reliable source of tissue for reconstructive surgeons and also avoids the sometimes troublesome and often unsightly dorsal donor site wound.

This was mainly because microvascular techniques were still in development and the required instruments and microscopes were not widely available. However, over the years, it became possible to achieve excellent, reliable results without the problems of fat necrosis and abdominal wall weakness associated with the pedicled version (<a href="#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_8">Grotting et al 1989</a>, <a href="#bib2" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_2">Arnez et al 1991</a>, <a href="#bib18" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_18">Schusterman et al 1994</a>). The TRAM flap particularly lends itself to microsurgical transfer on account of the characteristics of the supplying vessels (the inferior epigastric artery is 2.5–3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm in diameter and its venae comitantes are 3<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm in diameter); the length of the pedicle (frequently up to 15<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>cm); and the large surface area of skin supplied by these vessels (see <a href="../B9780702077050000537/B9780702077050000537.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 53.1</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0095">Further developments in dissection techniques, combined with a desire to reduce donor site morbidity, led to the first description of a ‘perforator’ flap based on the same vessels (<a href="#bib1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_1">Allen and Treece 1994</a>). This is the DIEP flap, which captures the same soft tissue area of the abdomen for reconstruction, but attempts to avoid injury to rectus abdominis by dissecting the perforating vessels through the muscle rather than by sacrificing it. Some authors have identified fewer donor site bulges and herniae with DIEP flaps compared with TRAM flaps (<a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_3">Blondeel et al 1997</a>), and it is for this reason that DIEP flaps are the preferred choice, if possible. However, the perforating vessels are not always anatomically favourable for allowing safe harvest of the flap. Many clinicians have adopted radiological studies (CT angiogram, duplex or MR angiogram) to determine the calibre and position of the vessels preoperatively for more accurate surgical planning (see <a
