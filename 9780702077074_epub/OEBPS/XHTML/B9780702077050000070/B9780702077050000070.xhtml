In an average 70<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>kg person, the skin weighs approximately 13<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>kg and has a surface area of about 2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>m<sup>2</sup>. It covers the entire external surface of the body, including the external acoustic meatus, the lateral aspect of the tympanic membrane and the vestibule of the nose. It is continuous with the mucosae of the alimentary, respiratory and urogenital tracts, and fuses with the conjunctiva at the margins of the eyelids, and with the lining of the lacrimal canaliculi at the lacrimal puncta. The thickness of the skin ranges from 1.5 to 5.0<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm and depends mainly on its location.</div><div class="text" id="p0020">The skin forms a self-renewing interface between the body and its environment. It provides an effective barrier against microbial organisms, and protects against mechanical, chemical, osmotic, thermal and ultraviolet radiation damage. It is an important site of immune surveillance against the entry of pathogens and the initiation of primary immune responses. For instance, the skin produces various antimicrobial peptides such as human cathelicidin LL-37, a small cationic peptide that can prevent the immunostimulatory effects of bacterial wall molecules such as lipopolysaccharide and therefore protect against endotoxaemia. It can inhibit neutrophil apoptosis and stimulate angiogenesis, tissue regeneration and release of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-8. Specific innate immune defenses in the skin are present throughout the epidermis, dermis, hair follicles and appendages, and in the absence of skin diseases or trauma, provide a resilient buffer against external microorganisms (<a href="#bib37" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_37">Tikoo et al 2018</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0025">Skin performs many biochemical synthetic processes, including the formation of vitamin D under the influence of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation and synthesis of cytokines and growth factors. Skin is the target of a variety of hormones such as thyroxine, androgens and oestrogens. These activities can affect the appearance and function of individual skin components, such as the sebaceous glands, the hairs and the pigment-producing cells.</div><div class="text" id="p0030">Control of body temperature is an important function of skin, and is effected mainly by regulation of heat loss from the cutaneous circulation through the rapid increase or reduction in the flow of blood to an extensive external surface area. This process is also assisted by sweating. In disorders such as erythroderma, in which more than 90% of the skin is inflamed and red, insensible fluid losses can exceed several litres per day and can result in shock if treatment is not initiated promptly. Skin is involved in socio-sexual communication and can signal emotional states by means of muscular and vascular responses. It is a major sensory organ, richly supplied by nerve terminals and specialized receptors for touch, temperature, pain and other stimuli.</div><div class="text" id="p0035">Skin has good frictional properties, assisting locomotion and manipulation by its texture. It is elastic, and can be stretched and compressed within limits. The outer surface is covered by skin lines, some of which are large and conspicuous while others are microscopic, or are only revealed after manipulation or incision of the skin.</div><div class="text" id="p0040">The colour of human skin is derived from, and varies with, the amount of blood (and its degree of oxygenation) in the cutaneous circulation, the thickness of the cornified layer and the ratio of eumelanin (brown/black) to pheomelanin (red/yellow). Melanin has a protective role against UV radiation and acts as a scavenger of harmful free radicals. Ethnic variations in colour are mainly due to differences in the amount, type and distribution of melanin and are genetically determined. These genetic variants may also determine the prevalence of benign skin lesions such as freckles, as well as susceptibility to common forms of non-melanoma skin cancers and skin ageing (<a href="#bib24" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_24">Law et al 2017</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0045">The appearance of skin is affected by many other factors, e.g. size, shape and distribution of hairs and of skin glands (sweat, sebaceous and apocrine), and changes associated with maturation, ageing, metabolism and pregnancy. The general state of health is reflected in the appearance and condition of the skin, and the earliest signs of many systemic disorders may be apparent in the skin.</div><section><a id="s0025"/><section><a id="s0020"/><section><a id="s9025"/><h3 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0025">Skin microbiome</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0060">Each square centimetre of skin contains approximately one million bacteria (comprising hundreds of distinct species) forming a complex community that also contains viruses and fungi. The exact composition of the community of these organisms varies across different body sites and depends on several factors, including sebaceous gland concentration, moisture content and temperature, host genetics and exogenous environmental factors. The multiple organisms are not just commensals but play a much bigger role in immune modulation and epithelial health (<a href="#bib3" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_3">Chen et al 2018</a>). Dissecting the nature of microbe–host interactions and discovering the factors that drive microbial colonization are likely to provide greater insight into the pathogenesis of skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, and inform the development of potential new therapies.</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0030"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0030">Classification of skin</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0065">Although skin in different parts of the body is fundamentally of similar structure, there are many local variations in parameters such as thickness, mechanical strength, softness, flexibility, degree of keratinization (cornification), size and number of hairs, frequency and types of glands, pigmentation, vascularity and innervation (<a href="#f0010"><span class="bold">Figs 7.1</span></a>–<a href="#f0025"><span class="bold">7.4</span></a>). Human skin is divided into two main types: hairless (glabrous) skin and hair-bearing skin. Hairless skin is found on the palms and soles where it has a grooved surface, with alternating ridges and sulci giving rise to the dermatoglyphics (fingerprints). In palmar and plantar skin, there is a compact cornified layer which may be up to 10 times thicker than in other body sites: this skin is thus also termed thick skin. There are, however, sites such as the lips and nipples, where hairless skin has a relatively thin cornified layer.</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0010"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000070/main.assets/f07-01-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0010"/><a id="fspara0010"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 7.1</span> The organization of skin, comparing the structures found in thick, hairless (plantar and palmar) skin with thin, hairy (hirsute) skin.

Hair-bearing skin (most thin skin bears hairs) has both hair follicles and sebaceous glands associated with the follicles. Hair follicle size, structure and density can vary between different body sites. Notably, scalp has large hair follicles whereas the forehead has only small, vellus hair-producing follicles. Some hair-bearing sites, such as the axilla, contain apocrine glands as well as eccrine sweat glands. Sebaceous gland function varies with age, being active in neonates, and from puberty onwards: the relative activity influences the composition of the skin surface lipids and the skin microbiome. There are regional variations in the structure of the dermal–epidermal junction, with more hemidesmosomes and anchoring fibrils in the skin of the leg than in the skin of the arm. In the dermis, the arrangement and size of elastic fibres varies, e.g. they are very large in perianal skin, whereas there are almost none in the scrotum. Cutaneous blood supply varies markedly between areas such as the eyelid and more rigid areas such as the fingertips.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0040"/><hgroup><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0040">Microstructure of Skin and Skin Appendages</h2><h3 class="h2after1" id="cesectitle0045">Epidermis</h3></hgroup><section><a id="s0045"/><div class="textfl" id="p0085">The epidermis (see <a href="#f0015">Figs 7.2</a>–<a href="#f0020">7.3</a>) is a self-renewing stratified epithelial tissue consisting mainly of keratinocytes. Other cells within the epidermis include melanocytes (pigment-forming cells from the embryonic neural crest), Langerhans cells (immature antigen-presenting dendritic cells derived from bone marrow), lymphocytes and Merkel cells. Merkel cells may function as sensory mechanoreceptors or possibly as part of the dispersed neuroendocrine system and many are associated with nerve endings. Free sensory nerve endings are sparsely present within the epidermis.</div><div class="text" id="p0090">The population of keratinocytes undergoes continuous renewal throughout life (<a href="#bib16" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_16">Gonzales and Fuchs 2017</a>). Turnover is mediated by epidermal stem cells in the basal layer of the epidermis which generate daughter cells that undergo a series of biochemical and physical changes as they migrate towards the surface of the skin to form the various layers of the epidermis. They transform from polygonal living cells to non-viable flattened squames full of intermediate filament proteins (keratins) embedded in a dense matrix of cytoplasmic proteins to form mature keratin.</div><div class="text" id="p0095">The epidermis consists of several layers. The innermost layer, the basal layer (stratum basale) is succeeded by the spinous or prickle cell layer (stratum spinosum), granular layer (stratum granulosum), clear layer (stratum lucidum) and cornified layer (stratum corneum), which is the most superficial (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 7.4</a>). The first three of these layers are metabolically active compartments through which cells pass and change their morphology as they undergo cellular differentiation. The more superficial layers of cells undergo terminal keratinization <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="146" id="pagebreak_146"/><a id="pg146"/>(cornification), which involves not only structural changes in keratinocytes, but also molecular and biochemical changes within the cells and their surroundings.</div><div class="text" id="p0100">The epidermal appendages (pilosebaceous units, sweat glands and nails) are formed developmentally by the ingrowth of the epidermis.</div><section><a id="s0050"/><hgroup><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0050">Keratinocytes</h4><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0055">Basal layer</h5></hgroup><section><a id="s0055"/><div class="textfl" id="p0105">The basal layer is the innermost layer of the epidermis, next to the dermis and is the site of epidermal cellular proliferation.

By transmission electron microscopy, the basal lamina consists of a clear lamina lucida adjacent to the basal cell plasma membrane and a darker electron-dense lamina densa (<a href="#f0035"><span class="bold">Fig. 7.6</span></a>). The basal plasma membranes of the basal keratinocytes, the extracellular basal laminae and the anchoring fibrils of type VII collagen within the subjacent dermal matrix (lamina fibroreticularis) which insert into the lamina densa, collectively form the basement membrane zone (BMZ) at the dermal–epidermal junction. This is a highly convoluted interface, particularly in thick, hairless skin, where dermal papillae (rete ridges) project into the epidermis, interlocking with adjacent downward projections of the epidermis (rete pegs) (see <a href="#f0025">Fig. 7.4</a>).</div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0030"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000070/main.assets/f07-05-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0030"/><a id="fspara0030"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 7.5</span> The major features of a hemidesmosome in the basement membrane zone (BMZ) of skin, including some of the important molecular components.

The cytoplasm contains variable numbers of melanosomes and keratin filament bundles corresponding to the keratin tonofilaments of classical electron microscopy. In the basal keratinocytes, these keratins consist mostly of keratin 5 (K5) and keratin 14 (K14) proteins. The plasma membranes of interconnecting cells are coupled by desmosomes; those of the basal keratinocytes are linked to the basal lamina by hemidesmosomes (see <a href="#f0030">Figs 7.5</a>–<a href="#f0035">7.6</a>, <a href="../B978070207705000001X/B978070207705000001X.xhtml#f0135">1.26</a>).

Intraepithelial lymphocytes are present in small numbers.</div><div class="text" id="p0120">Keratinocyte stem cells are found within the basal layer of the epidermis (<a href="#bib13" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_13">Fuchs 2016</a>): they are thought to reside mainly in the interfollicular epidermis in the troughs of rete pegs, and in the outer root sheath bulge of the hair follicle and in sebaceous glands. Their progeny, called transit (or transient) amplifying cells, also reside within the basal layer and pass through a few rounds of proliferation before terminally differentiating. The activity of epidermal stem cells and transit amplifying cells in the basal layer provides a continuous supply of differentiating cells that move suprabasally, eventually forming the cornified (corneocyte) layer of the epidermis.</div><div class="text" id="p0125">Epidermal stem cells and their differentiated progeny are organized into columns, the epidermal proliferation units. Several layers of prickle and granular cells overlie a cluster of 6–8 basal cells, forming a columnar proliferative unit. Each group of basal cells consists of a central stem cell with an encircling ring of transit amplifying proliferative cells and postmitotic maturing cells. From the periphery of this unit, postmitotic cells transfer into the prickle cell layer. The normal total epidermal turnover time is between 52 and 75 days. In some skin disorders, the turnover rates and transit times are significantly shortened, e.g. in psoriasis, the total epidermal turnover time may be as little as 8 days. In homeostatic conditions, the multiple stem cell populations in skin generally contribute only to the differentiation programme of restricted local cells. However, following injury that inflicts systemic and local environmental change, the various stem cell populations, e.g. those in hair follicles, may display remarkable plasticity, responding to wound-induced stimuli by exiting their niche and participating in re-epithelializing damaged tissue. This process may involve a transient or permanent switch of their tissue regeneration programme depending upon the particular type of wound. Understanding the molecular basis of the ‘switch’ is likely to have considerable relevance to improving wound healing and developing the field of regenerative medicine.</div></section><section><a id="s0060"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0060">Prickle cell layer</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0130">The prickle cell layer (stratum spinosum) (see <a href="#f0020">Fig. 7.3</a>; <a href="#f0040"><span class="bold">Fig. 7.7</span></a>), consists of several layers of closely packed keratinocytes that are connected to each other by desmosomes, the specialized cell–cell junctions that provide tensile strength and cohesion to the layer. When a section of skin is stained by haematoxylin and eosin and viewed by routine light microscopy, intercellular bridges corresponding to the locations of the desmosomes are seen between the dehydrated keratinocytes, giving these suprabasal cells their characteristic spiny appearance.

This is possible in part because of the presence of an epidermal lipid layer that consists of a variety of lipids that are synthesized in the epidermis. These include triglycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, cholesterol, cholesterol esters, glycosphingolipids and ceramides. Furthermore, 7-dehydrocholesterol, an intermediate molecule in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and a precursor of vitamin D, is synthesized in the skin. The content and composition of epidermal lipids change with differentiation (<a href="#bib10" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_10">Elias et al 2014</a>). Phospholipids and glycolipids first accumulate within keratinocytes above the basal layer, but higher up they are broken down and are practically absent from the cornified layer.

The cells of the retinal pigment epithelium, developed from the outer wall of the optic cup, also produce melanin, and neurones in different locations within the brainstem (e.g. the locus coeruleus and substantia nigra) synthesize a variety of melanin called neuromelanin. In humans there are two classes, the brown–black eumelanin and the red–yellow pheomelanin, both derived from the substrate tyrosine.

The numbers per unit area of epidermis range from 2300 per mm<sup>2</sup> in cheek skin to 800 per mm<sup>2</sup> in abdominal skin. It is estimated that a single melanocyte may be in functional contact via its dendritic processes with up to 30 keratinocytes.

Mature melanosomes move into the dendritic processes along the surfaces of microtubules and are transferred to keratinocytes through their phagocytic activity (<a href="#bib45" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_45">Wu and Hammer 2014</a>). Keratinocytes engulf and internalize the tip of the dendrite, so that the contained melanosomes are pinched off into the keratinocyte cytoplasm. Here, they may exist as individual granules in heavily pigmented skin, or be packaged within secondary lysosomes as melanosome complexes in lightly pigmented skin. In basal keratinocytes they can be seen to accumulate in a crescent-shaped cap over the distal part of the nucleus. As the keratinocytes progress towards the surface of the epidermis, melanosomes undergo degradation, and melanin remnants in the cornified layer form dust-like particles. Melanosomes are degraded more rapidly in light-skinned than in dark-skinned individuals, in whom melanosomes persist in cells of the more superficial layers. Melanosomes are acidic, which explains why the larger melanosomes present in dark skin types are associated with a more acidic skin surface (pH<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>4.3), compared to lighter skin types (pH<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>5.3).

However, a high concentration of melanin may adversely affect synthesis of vitamin D in darker-skinned individuals living in northern latitudes. Melanin pigmentation is both constitutive and facultative. Constitutive pigmentation is the intrinsic level of pigmentation and is genetically determined, whereas facultative pigmentation represents reversible changes <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="150" id="pagebreak_150"/><a id="pg150"/>induced by environmental agents, e.g. UV and X-radiation, chemicals and hormones. Racial variations in pigmentation are due to differences in melanocyte morphology and activity rather than to differences in number or distribution. In skin with naturally heavy pigmentation, the cells tend to be larger and more dendritic and to contain more large, late-stage melanosomes than the melanocytes of paler skins. The keratinocytes in turn contain more melanosomes, individually dispersed, whereas in light skins the majority are contained within secondary lysosomes to form melanosome complexes (<a href="#bib6" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_6">D’Mello et al 2016</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0200">The response to UV light includes immediate tanning with pigment darkening and can occur within minutes as a result of photo-oxidation of pre-existing melanin.

In the head and neck the hypodermis also contains striated muscles, e.g. platysma, which are remnants of more extensive sheets of skin-associated musculature found in other mammals (panniculus adiposus).</div><div id="p9275"/><div><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0095"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000070/main.assets/on07-06-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0175"/><a id="fspara0175"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 7.18</span> Adipocytes (fat cells) in human skin.</figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="text" id="p0285">The amount and distribution of subcutaneous fat varies according to gender: it is generally more abundant and more widely distributed in females, whereas it diminishes from the trunk to the extremities in males.

They grow out of the skin at an angle (see <a href="../B978070207705000046X/B978070207705000046X.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 46.1</a>), as is evident in the sloping of the hairs on the dorsum of forearm, hand and fingers towards the ulnar side. Hairs are absent from several areas of the body, including the thick skin of the palms, soles, the flexor surfaces of the digits, the thin skin of the lip, umbilicus, nipples, glans penis and clitoris, the labia minora and the inner aspects of the labia majora and prepuce. The presence, distribution and relative abundance of hair in certain regions such as the face (in males), pubis and axillae, are secondary sexual characteristics that play a role in socio-sexual communication. There are individual variations in density, form, distribution and pigmentation. Hairs assist in thermoregulation, e.g. on the scalp they provide some protection against injury and the harmful effects of solar radiation. They also have a sensory function.</div><div class="text" id="p0305">Hair density varies from approximately 600 per cm<sup>2</sup> on the face to 60 per cm<sup>2</sup> on the rest of the body. In length, hairs range from less than a millimetre to more than a metre, and in width from 0.005 to 0.6<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>mm. They can be straight, coiled, helical or wavy, and differ in colour depending on the type and degree of pigmentation. Curly hairs tend to have a flattened cross-section, and are weaker than straight hairs. Over most of the body surface, hairs are short and narrow (vellus hairs) and in some areas these hairs do not project beyond their follicles, e.g. in eyelid skin. In other regions they are longer, thicker and often heavily pigmented (terminal hairs); these include the hairs of the scalp, the eyelashes and eyebrows, and the postpubertal skin of the axillae and pubis, and the moustache, beard and chest hairs of males. The presence in females of coarse terminal hairs in a male-like pattern is termed hirsutism and can be familial or a sign of an endocrine disorder involving excess androgen production.</div><section><a id="s0140"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0140">Hair follicle</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0310">The hair follicle (see <a href="#f0010">Figs 7.1</a>, <a href="#f0105">7.20</a>; <a href="#f0110"><span class="bold">Fig. 7.21A</span></a>) is a downgrowth of the epidermis containing a hair.

Typically, the long axis of the follicle is oblique to the skin surface; with curly hairs it is also curved. There are cycles of hair growth and loss, during which the follicle presents with different appearances. In the anagen phase, the hair is actively growing and the follicle is at its maximal extent of development. In the involuting or catagen phase, hair growth ceases and the follicle shrinks.

The dermal hair papilla is an important cluster of inductive mesenchymal cells, which is required for hair follicle growth in each cycle throughout adult life; it is a continuation of the layer of adventitious mesenchyme that follows the contours of the hair follicle. The hair bulb generates the hair and its inner root sheath. A hypothetical line drawn across the widest part of the hair bulb divides it into a lower germinal matrix and an upper bulb. The germinal matrix is formed of closely packed, mitotically active pluripotential keratinocytes, among which are interspersed melanocytes and some Langerhans cells. The upper bulb consists of cells arising from the matrix. These migrate apically and differentiate along several lines. Those arising centrally form the hair medulla. Radially, successive concentric rings of cells give rise to the cortex and cuticle of the hair and, outside this, to the three layers of the inner root sheath. The latter are, from innermost to outer, the cuticle of the inner root sheath, Huxley's layer and Henle's layer. Henle's layer is surrounded by the outer root sheath, which forms the cellular wall of the follicle (see <a href="#f0110">Fig. 7.21</a>). Differentiation of cells in the various layers of the hair and its inner root sheath begins at the level of the upper bulb and is asynchronous, beginning earliest in Henle's layer and Huxley's layer.</div></section><section><a id="s0155"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0155">Structure of hair and its sheaths</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0325">A fully developed hair shaft consists of three concentric zones, which are, from outermost to inner, the cuticle, cortex and medulla.

The cuticle forms the hair surface and consists of several layers of overlapping cornified squames directed apically and slightly outwards (<a href="#f0115"><span class="bold">Fig. 7.22</span></a>). Immature cuticle cells have dense amorphous granules aligned predominantly along the outer plasma membrane with a few filaments. The cortex forms the greater part of the hair shaft and consists of numerous closely packed, elongated squames, which may contain nuclear remnants and melanosomes. Immature cortical cells contain bundles of closely packed filaments but no dense granules, and when fully cornified, they have a characteristic thumbprint appearance with filaments arranged in whorls. The medulla, when present, is composed of loosely aggregated and often discontinuous columns of partially disintegrated cells containing vacuoles, scattered filaments, granular material and melanosomes.

When fully differentiated, cells of both layers have a thickened cornified <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="153" id="pagebreak_153"/><a id="pg153"/>envelope enclosing keratin filaments embedded in a matrix. The cells of the inner root sheath cuticle undergo terminal differentiation at a level closer to the hair bulb than that of Huxley's layer, but lack a clear-cut filament pattern such as is seen in the cortical cells of the hair shaft.

In humans, these occur in irregular cycles of variable duration; there are regional and other variations in the length of the individual phases. In the growing or anagen phase, follicle and hair are as described above. Melanocytes are active only in mid-anagen, and are capable of producing both pheo- and eumelanosomes, which they pass to precortical and medullary keratinocytes. Changes in hair colour of an individual, usually in adolescence, are due to alterations in the dominant type of melanosome produced.</div><div class="text" id="p0350">Anagen is followed by the involuting or catagen phase, during which mitotic activity of the germinal matrix ceases, the base of the hair condenses into a club that moves upwards to the level of the arrector pili muscle, and the whole inferior segment of the follicle degenerates. The dermal papilla also ascends and remains close to the base of the shortened follicle and its enclosed club hair, a situation that persists during the resting or telogen phase. During telogen, melanocytes become amelanotic and can be identified only ultrastructurally. At the beginning of the next anagen, the epithelial cells at the base of the follicle divide to form a secondary hair rudiment, which envelops the dermal papilla to form a new hair bulb. This grows downwards, reforming the inferior segment of the follicle, from which a new hair grows up alongside the club hair, which is eventually shed.</div><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="154" id="pagebreak_154"/></div><div class="text" id="p0355">Postnatally, hairs exhibit regional asynchrony of cycle duration and phase leading to an irregular pattern of growth and replacement. In some regions, such as the scalp, the cycle is measured in years; in others, such as general body hair, the cycle is much shorter and hairs are therefore limited in length. At puberty, hair growth and generation of much thicker hairs occurs on the pubes and axillae in both sexes, and on the face and trunk in males. The actions of hormones on hair growth are complex, and involve not only sex hormones, but also those of the thyroid, suprarenal cortex and pituitary glands. Androgens stimulate facial and general body hair formation. After about the first 30 years, they tend to cause the thick terminal hairs of the scalp to change to small vellus hairs, which produces recession from the forehead and sometimes almost complete male pattern baldness. In females, oestrogens tend to maintain vellus hairs; postmenopausal reduction of oestrogens may permit stronger facial and bodily hair growth. In mid-pregnancy, hair growth may be particularly active but later, often post partum, an unusually large number of hairs enter the telogen phase and are shed before the growth cycle recommences. In older males, growth of hairs on the eyebrows and within the nostrils and external acoustic meatus increases, whereas elsewhere on the body, growth slows and the hairs become much finer.</div><div class="text" id="p0360">Measurements of the rate of growth of individual hairs vary considerably, probably because of the influence of the factors mentioned above.

Most associate with the hair follicle and arrector pili muscle to form the pilosebaceous unit. They are present over the whole body except the thick, hairless skin of the palm, soles and flexor surfaces of digits. Typically, they consist of a cluster of secretory acini, which open by a short common duct into the dermal pilary canal of the hair follicle. They release their lipid secretory product, sebum, into the canal by a holocrine mechanism (see below). In some areas of thin skin that lack hair follicles, their ducts open instead directly onto the skin surface, e.g. on the lips and corners of the mouth, the buccal mucosa, nipples (Montgomery's glands), areolae of the female breast, penis, inner surface of the prepuce, clitoris and labia minora.

They are also numerous in the midline of the back. Individual sebaceous glands are particularly large on the face, around the external acoustic meatus, chest and shoulders, and on the anogenital surfaces. Those on the face are often related to very small vellus hairs whose follicles have particularly wide apertures (<a href="#bib44" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_44">Zouboulis et al 2016</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0375">Microscopically, the glandular acini are enclosed in a basal lamina supported by a thin dermal capsule and a rich capillary network. Each acinus is lined by a single layer of small, flat, polygonal epithelial cells (sebocytes), which, when terminally differentiated, produce and accumulate sebum. They possess euchromatic nuclei and large nucleoli, scattered keratin filaments, free ribosomes, smooth endoplasmic reticulum and rounded mitochondria, and are attached to each other by desmosomes. Mitotically active cells give rise to progeny that move gradually towards the centre of the acinus, increasing in volume and accumulating increasingly large lipid vacuoles. The nuclei become pyknotic as the cells mature. The huge distended cells ultimately disintegrate, filling the central cavity and its duct with a mass of fatty cellular debris (holocrine secretion; see <a href="../B9780702077050000021/B9780702077050000021.xhtml#f0035">Figs 2.6</a>, <a href="#f0120"><span class="bold">7.23</span></a>). The process takes 2–3 weeks. The secretory products pass through a wide duct lined with keratinized stratified squamous epithelium into the infundibulum of the hair follicle and then to the surface of the hair and the general epidermis.</div><div class="text" id="p0380">While its full range of functions in the skin remains to be clarified, sebum is a key component of the epidermal barrier, as well as having a key role in the skin's immune system. Sebum also contributes to a characteristic body odour. When first formed, sebum is a complex mixture of over 50% di- and triglycerides, with smaller proportions of wax esters, squalene, cholesterol esters, cholesterol and free fatty acids. At birth, sebaceous glands are quite large, regressing later until stimulated again at puberty. At that time, sebaceous gland growth and secretory activity increase greatly in both males and females, under the influence of androgens (testicular and suprarenal), which act directly on the gland. Excessive amounts of sebum may become impacted within the duct and this, associated with hyperkeratinization, may lead to blockage and formation of a comedone. This may become inflamed, and is the primary lesion of acne. Acne is the most common disease caused by dysfunction of the sebocyte. Oestrogens have an effect opposite to that of androgens; sebum secretion is considerably lower in women, and usually decreases significantly after the menopause (<a href="#bib31" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_31">Piérard-Franchimont and Piérard 2002</a>).</div></section><section><a id="s0170"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0170">Apocrine glands</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0385">Apocrine glands are particularly large glands found in the dermis or subcutaneous fat.

Each coil is lined by cuboidal secretory cells whose apical cytoplasm projects into the lumen and basally is in contact with a layer of myoepithelial cells within a thick basal lamina. The secretory cells contain vacuoles, vesicles and dense granules of varying size and internal structure; the numbers and character vary with the cycle of synthesis and discharge. The mechanism of secretion is still not clear but may involve merocrine secretion of granules, apocrine secretion or complete holocrine disintegration of the cells (see <a href="../B9780702077050000021/B9780702077050000021.xhtml#f0035">Fig 2.6</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0395">Apocrine activity is minimal before puberty, after which it is androgen-dependent and responsive to emotional stimuli. It is controlled by adrenergic nerves and is sensitive to adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine). The secretion is initially sterile and odourless, but it undergoes bacterial decomposition to generate odorous and musky compounds, including short-chain fatty acids, and steroids such as 5α-androstenone. In many animals these are potent pheromonal signals but their role in humans is less certain.</div></section><section><a id="s0175"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0175">Arrector pili muscles</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0400">The arrector pili muscles are small bundles of closely packed smooth muscle cells that form oblique links between the dermal sheaths of hair <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="155" id="pagebreak_155"/><a id="pg155"/>follicles and the papillary layer of the dermis (see <a href="#f0010">Figs 7.1</a>, <a href="#f0105">7.20</a>). They show the typical features of smooth muscle cells and are separated by narrow spaces containing collagen fibres and unmyelinated noradrenergic sympathetic axons. The muscles are attached to the bulge region of the follicles by elastin fibrils, and are directed obliquely and towards the side to which the hair slopes superficially. The sebaceous gland occupies the angle between the muscle and the hair follicle: muscle contraction helps to expel the gland contents. Contraction tends to pull the hair into a more vertical position and to elevate the epidermis surrounding it into a small hillock (goose bump), dimpling the skin surface where the muscle is inserted superficially. Arrector pili muscles are absent from facial, axillary and pubic hairs, eyelashes and eyebrows, and from the hairs around the nostrils and the external acoustic meatus.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0180"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0180">Sweat glands</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0405">The vast majority of sweat glands (<a href="#f0125"><span class="bold">Figs 7.24</span></a>–<a href="#f0130"><span class="bold">Fig. 7.25</span></a>) are classically termed eccrine, although their mode of secretion includes typical merocrine mechanisms.

Three types of cell have been described: clear cells, from which most of the secretion is derived; dark cells, which share the same lumen; and myoepithelial cells. Clear cells are approximately pyramidal in shape, and their bases rest on the basal lamina or are in contact with the myoepithelial cells. Their apical plasma membranes line lateral intercellular canaliculi that connect with the main lumen. The basolateral plasma membranes are highly folded, and interdigitate with apposed clear cells; they have the basal membrane infoldings typical of cells involved in transcytotic fluid and ion transport from the interstitial fluid to the glandular lumen. Their cytoplasm contains glycogen granules, mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum and a small Golgi complex, but few other organelles. The nucleus is round and moderately euchromatic. Dark cells are pyramidal and lie closer to the lumen, such that their broad ends form its lining. Their cytoplasm contains a well-developed Golgi complex, numerous vacuoles and vesicles, and dense glycoprotein granules, which they secrete by a typical merocrine mechanism. Myoepithelial cells (see <a href="../B9780702077050000021/B9780702077050000021.xhtml#f0020">Figs 2.3</a>–<a href="../B9780702077050000021/B9780702077050000021.xhtml#f0025">2.4</a>) resemble those associated with secretory acini of the salivary glands and breast, and contain abundant myofilaments.</div><div class="text" id="p0425">The intradermal sweat duct is composed of an outer basal layer and an inner layer of luminal cells connected by numerous desmosomes. The intraepidermal sweat duct (acrosyringium) is coiled and consists of two layers of cells, which, developmentally, are different from the surrounding keratinocytes and can be distinguished from them by the presence of keratin K19. The outer cells near the surface contain keratohyalin granules and lamellar granules, and undergo typical cornification. The inner cells, from a mid-epidermal level, contain numerous vesicles, undergo an incomplete form of cornification, and are largely shed into the lumen at the level of the cornified epidermal layer.

Excessive sweating can lead to salt depletion. Heavy metals and various organic compounds are eliminated in sweat. When first secreted, the fluid is similar in composition to interstitial fluid. It is modified as it passes along the duct by the action mainly of the basal cells, which resorb sodium, chloride and some water: the hormone aldosterone enhances this activity. The sweat glands are capable of producing up to 10 litres of sweat per day, in response to thermal, emotional and taste stimuli, mediated by unmyelinated sympathetic cholinergic fibres. The glands also respond to adrenaline (epinephrine). Thermoregulation is coordinated via a heat centre in the preoptic region, in and near the rostral hypothalamus, which reacts to changes in blood temperature and afferent stimuli from the skin by initiating appropriate responses such as controlling cutaneous blood supply, the rate and volume of sweat secretion (for evaporation at the surface) and shivering.</div></section><section><a id="s0185"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0185">Nail apparatus</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0435">Nails (<a href="#f0140"><span class="bold">Fig. 7.27</span></a>) are homologous with the cornified layer of the general epidermis.

Ultrastructurally, the squames contain closely packed filaments that lie transversely to the direction of proximodistal growth, and are embedded in a dense protein matrix. Unlike the general epidermis, squames are not shed from the nail plate surface. A variety of mineral elements including calcium are present in nail. The hardness of nail is determined by the arrangement and cohesion of the layers of squames and their internal fibres, and not by the calcium content.

It is densely adherent to the matrices on its undersurface but becomes a free structure distal to the onychodermal band, where it separates from the nail bed. The dorsal aspect of the nail plate originates from the more proximal regions of the germinal matrix, i.e. dorsal and intermediate matrices, whereas the deeper, palmar (volar) aspect of the plate originates from the ventral matrix.</div></section><section><a id="s0195"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0195">Nail folds</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0455">The sides of the nail plate are bordered by the lateral nail folds, which are continuous with the proximal fold (see <a href="#f0140">Fig. 7.27</a>). They are bounded by the attachment of the skin to the lateral aspect of the distal phalanx margin and the lateral nail. The proximal nail fold provides the visible proximal border to the nail apparatus. It consists of superficial and deep epidermal layers separated by a core of dermis. The epidermis of the superficial layer lacks hair follicles and epidermal ridges, and its cornified distal margin extends over the nail plate as the cuticle or eponychium. The deep layer merges with the nail matrix. The eponychium is bounded by the fascial attachment of the skin to the base of the distal phalanx, distal to the insertion of the extensor tendon, and its distal free edge. It adheres to the dorsal aspect of the nail plate and overlies the root of the nail.</div></section><section><a id="s0200"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0200">Nail matrix</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0460">The nail matrix is the main source of the nail plate and can be subdivided into three parts. Proximally, it is defined as the palmar or volar surface (undersurface) of the proximal nail fold. The intermediate matrix (germinal matrix) starts where the dorsal matrix folds back on itself and extends as far as the distal portion of the lunula (lunule). The ventral matrix (sterile matrix) is the remainder of the nail bed; it starts at the distal border of the lunula and ends at the hyponychium.</div><div class="text" id="p0465">The matrix epithelium consists of typical basal and prickle layer keratinocytes, among which are scattered melanocytes and Langerhans cells. Cornified cells of the dorsal and ventral aspects of the matrix are steadily extruded distally to form the nail plate. The proximal 50% of the nail matrix contributes approximately 80% of the nail plate. This process continues into the nail bed at the distal edge of the lunula, which is formed where the distal portion of the ventral matrix underlies the nail plate.</div><div class="text" id="p0470">The lunula is pale, opaque and convex, and is most prominent in the thumb nail. It is not known why the lunula is so pale compared with the more distal translucent pink nail bed.

The distal margin of the nail bed, which is the point where the nail plate becomes free of the nail bed, is called the onychodermal band. The surface of the nail bed is ridged and grooved longitudinally, corresponding to a similar pattern on the undersurface of the nail plate. This arrangement results in a tight interlocking between the nail plate and the underlying nail bed, protecting against microbial invasion and the collection of debris underneath the nail. The epidermis of the nail bed is thin and lacks a granular layer. It consists of 2–3 layers of nucleated cells that lack keratohyalin granules, and a thin cornified layer that moves distally with the growing nail plate. It contains an occasional sweat gland distally.</div><div class="text" id="p0480">The dermis of the nail bed is anchored to the periosteum of the distal phalanx without an underlying subcutaneous layer. It forms a tight compartment, which means that infections involving the nail bed or an increase in pressure, e.g. resulting from a haematoma, may cause severe pain that may be relieved by the removal of part or all of the nail plate. The dermis of the nail bed is richly vascularized. The blood vessels are arranged longitudinally and display numerous glomus bodies, which are encapsulated arteriovenous anastomoses involved in the physiological control of peripheral blood flow in relation to temperature. The dermis of the nail bed is well innervated by numerous sensory nerve endings, including Merkel endings and Meissner's corpuscles.

The cutaneous circulation has an important thermoregulatory function, and is organized so that its capacity can be rapidly increased or decreased by as much as 20 times, in response to a need to lose or conserve body heat. The ability to control skin blood flow decreases with ageing, making older adults less able to thermoregulate adequately. Lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, diet and smoking, might interact with the ageing process to modulate ‘normal’ age-associated changes in the cutaneous microcirculation.</div><div class="text" id="p0510">The blood supply to the skin originates from the direct cutaneous, musculocutaneous and fasciocutaneous systems. The direct cutaneous system of vessels is derived from the main arterial trunks and accompanying veins. These vessels course in the subcutaneous fat parallel to the skin surface and are confined to certain areas of the body, e.g. the supraorbital artery, the superficial circumflex iliac artery and the dorsalis pedis artery. The musculocutaneous perforators arise from the intramuscular vasculature, pass through the surface of the muscle, and pierce the deep fascia to reach the skin by spreading out in the subcutaneous tissues. The fasciocutaneous system consists of perforating branches from deeply located vessels (deep to the deep fascia) that pass along intermuscular septa and then fan out at the level of the deep fascia to reach the skin. Examples include the fasciocutaneous perforating vessels from the radial and ulnar arteries.</div><div class="text" id="p0515">The direct cutaneous vessels, musculocutaneous perforators and fasciocutaneous perforators each contribute to six anastomosing horizontal reticular plexuses of arterioles (<a href="#f0145"><span class="bold">Fig. 7.28</span></a>), which have vascular connections between them and which ultimately provide the blood supply to the skin. Three plexuses are located in the skin itself and supply all elements including the sweat glands and pilosebaceous units. The subpapillary plexus is located at the junction of the papillary and reticular layers of the dermis and gives off small branches that form perpendicular capillary loops in the dermal papillae (usually one loop per papilla) (see <a href="#f0010">Figs 7.1</a>, <a href="#f0025">7.4</a>; <a href="#f0150"><span class="bold">Fig. 7.29</span></a>). The reticular dermal plexus is located in the middle portion of the dermis and is primarily venous. The deep dermal plexus is located in the deepest part of the reticular dermis and on the undersurface of the dermis.

In the deeper layers of the dermis, arteriovenous anastomoses are common, particularly in the extremities (hands, feet, ears, lips, nose), where vessels are surrounded by thick muscular coats. Under autonomic vasomotor control, these vascular shunts, when relaxed, divert blood away from the superficial plexus and so reduce heat loss, while at the same time ensuring maintenance of some deep cutaneous circulation and preventing anoxia of structures such as nerves. Extensive capillary anastomoses are present. Generally, cutaneous blood flow is regulated according to thermoregulatory need and also, in some areas of the body, according to emotional state. In very cold conditions, the peripheral circulation is greatly reduced by vasoconstriction, but intermittent spontaneous vasodilation results in periodic increases in temperature that prevent cooling to the level at which frostbite might occur.</div><div class="text" id="p0530">The lymphatics of the skin, as elsewhere, are small terminal vessels that collect interstitial fluid and macromolecules for return to the circulation via larger vessels. They also convey lymphocytes, Langerhans cells and macrophages to regional lymph nodes. They begin as blind-ended, endothelial-lined tubes or loops just below the papillary dermis. These drain into a superficial plexus below the subpapillary venous plexus, which drains via collecting vessels into a deeper plexus at the junction of the reticular dermis and subcutis, and this, in turn, drains into larger subcutaneous channels.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0230"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0230">Innervation</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0535">Skin is a richly innervated, major sensory organ. Information about the external environment is relayed through receptors responsive to various stimuli, whether mechanical (rapid or sustained touch, pressure, vibration, stretching, bending of hairs, etc.), thermal (hot or cold) or noxious (perceived as itching, discomfort or pain). Pacinian corpuscles detect deep pressure and vibrational sensation, and are located deep in the dermis or in the hypodermis, particularly of the digits. Meissner's corpuscles are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors found in hairy and hairless skin in dermal papillae close to the dermal–epidermal junction. They are responsible for sensing light touch, and are numerous in the finger pads, being particularly suited to detecting shape and texture during active exploratory touch (<a href="../B9780702077050000033/B9780702077050000033.xhtml">Ch. 3</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0540">Afferent sensory nerves may be myelinated or unmyelinated and are derived from neuronal cell bodies in cranial or spinal sensory ganglia. On reaching the dermis, nerve fasciculi branch extensively to form a deep reticular plexus that innervates much of the dermis, including most sweat glands, hair follicles and the larger arterioles. Many small fasciculi pass from this plexus to ramify in another superficial papillary plexus at the junction between the reticular and papillary layers of the dermis. Branches from this pass superficially into the papillary layer, ramifying horizontally and vertically, and terminate either in relation to encapsulated receptors, or as terminals reaching the level of the basal lamina. In some instances, they enter the epidermis as free endings that are responsive to light pressure and touch sensation or to nociceptive stimuli. As these fasciculi terminate, they lose their epineurial and perineurial sheaths, leaving the Schwann cell–axonal complexes or naked axons enveloped only by basal lamina, in direct contact with the matrix. These naked distal axonal terminals may be vulnerable to pathogens entering via a skin abrasion. The structure and classification of sensory endings are described in detail on <a href="../B9780702077050000033/B9780702077050000033.xhtml#pg62">p. 62</a>.</div><div class="text" id="p0545">The segmental arrangement of the spinal nerves is reflected in the sensory supply of the skin: a dermatome is the area supplied by all the cutaneous branches of an individual spinal nerve through its dorsal and ventral rami (see <a href="../B9780702077050000240/B9780702077050000240.xhtml#f0055">Fig. 24.10</a>).

By postfertilization week 7, two epidermal cell layers are present and the highly cellular nature of the developing dermis, containing fibroblasts and stellate cells, is evident (<a href="#f0160"><span class="bold">Fig. 7.31</span></a>). The interface between ectoderm and mesenchyme, known as the basement membrane zone (BMZ), is an important site of mutual interactions on which the maintenance of the two tissues depends, both in prenatal and postnatal life. Ectodermal cells, which characteristically contain glycogen deposits, contact each other at gap and tight junctions (occluding junctions, zonae occludentes). The layer so formed soon develops into a bilaminar epithelium, and desmosomes also appear. The basal germinative layer gives rise to the postnatal epidermis, and the superficial layer to the periderm, a transient layer confined to fetal life. The periderm maintains itself, expresses different keratin polypeptides, and grows by the mitotic activity of its own cells, independent of those of the germinative layer. Originally flattened, the periderm cells increase in depth; the central area containing the nucleus becomes elevated and projects as a globular elevation towards the amniotic cavity (<a href="#f0165"><span class="bold">Fig. 7.32</span></a>). The plasma membrane develops numerous surface microvilli with an extraneous coat of glycosaminoglycans, and cytoplasmic vesicles become prominent deep to it. These developments reach a peak between postmenstrual weeks 12–18, at which time the periderm is a major source of the amniotic fluid to which it may contribute glucose; it also has an absorptive function. From about postmenstrual week 20 onwards, the globular protrusions become undermined and pinched off to float free in the amniotic fluid. The now-flattened periderm cells undergo terminal differentiation to form a temporary protective layer for the underlying developing epidermis, against an amniotic fluid of changing composition as a result of the accumulation of products of fetal renal excretion. Up to parturition, the periderm squames continue to be cast off into the amniotic fluid and they contribute to the vernix caseosa, a layer of cellular debris that covers the fetal skin at birth.</div><div><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="159" id="pagebreak_159"/></div><section><a id="sf0155"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0155"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000070/main.assets/f07-22-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0115"/><a id="fspara0115"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 7.30</span> Development of the skin.</figcaption></figure></div><section><a id="sf0160"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0160"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000070/main.assets/f07-23-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0120"/><a id="fspara0120"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 7.31</span> Light microscopy of human embryonic skin at postfertilization week 7, revealing a flat two-cell layer epidermis overlying a very cellular dermis containing numerous fibroblasts and stellate cells. <br/><span class="figcredit">Courtesy of Dr James McMillan, St John’s Institute of Dermatology.</span></figcaption></figure></div></section><section><a id="sf0165"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0165"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000070/main.assets/f07-24-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0125"/><a id="fspara0125"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 7.32</span> Transmission electron micrograph of human fetal skin at postmenstrual week 21, showing the outer periderm layer (cell contents include glycogen, G); the inset shows early human hair follicle formation with a hair peg (H) projecting from the epidermis and extending into the dermis.

From an early stage, cells of all layers are packed with glycogen granules. Differentiation of these layers is not synchronous throughout all regions of the developing skin, being more advanced cranially than caudally, and progressing on the body from the mid-axillary line ventrally. Reduction in glycogen content of the cells is associated with a shift towards biosynthetic activity connected with terminal (cornifying) differentiation, manifested by the presence of different enzymes and expression of keratins. Simple epithelial keratins present from before implantation (K8 and K18) are replaced by typical keratinocyte basal cell keratins (K5 and K14), followed in the first suprabasal cell layer by those of higher molecular weight associated with differentiation (K1 and K10) at postfertilization weeks 10–12. This is soon followed by the expression of profilaggrin and filaggrin, and the appearance of keratohyalin granules among filamentous bundles of the uppermost intermediate layer cells at approximately postmenstrual week 20. The first fully differentiated keratinocytes appear shortly afterwards. By postmenstrual weeks 24–26, a definite cornified layer exists in some areas, and by approximately postmenstrual week 30, apart from some residual glycogen in intermediate cells, the interfollicular epidermis is essentially similar to its postnatal counterpart.</div></section><div class="text" id="p0575">Non-keratinocytes are present in developing epidermis from about postfertilization week 8. Langerhans cells can be seen in the epidermis by postfertilization weeks 5–6 and are fully differentiated by postfertilization weeks 12–14. Their numbers increase at least partially by mitotic division <span class="italic">in situ</span>, but at 6 months are only 10–20% of those in the adult. It is not known if Langerhans cells function in immune surveillance in fetal skin. Melanocytes are present in the bilaminar epidermis of cephalic regions as early as postfertilization week 8. By postfertilization weeks 12–14 they can reach a density of 2300 per mm<sup>2</sup>, reducing to 800 per mm<sup>2</sup> just before birth. Keratinocytes regulate the final ratio between themselves and melanocytes via growth factors, cell-surface molecules and other signals. Fetal melanocytes produce melanized melanosomes and transfer them to keratinocytes. This is an intrinsic activity independent of UV irradiation and suggests that melanin has functions other than photoprotection.</div><div class="text" id="p0580">Merkel cells begin to appear in the epidermis of the palm and sole of the foot between postfertilization weeks 8 and 12, and later in association with some hairs and with dermal axonal–Schwann cell complexes.</div></section><section><a id="s0250"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0250">Pilosebaceous unit</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0585">Pilosebaceous units develop in a cranio–caudal direction from about postfertilization week 9, first in the regions of the eyebrows, lips and chin. The hair placode is a collection of cells in the basal layer of the epidermis and develops adjacent to a local concentration of mesenchymal cells, which will eventually become the dermal papilla. Further proliferation and elongation of the cells lead to a hair germ, which protrudes downwards into the mesenchyme in association with the primitive dermal papilla around postmenstrual weeks 13–15. The hair germ becomes a hair peg as it migrates downwards within the developing skin, and when its bulbous lower portion envelops the dermal papilla it becomes known <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="160" id="pagebreak_160"/><a id="pg160"/>as a bulbous peg. Melanocytes are individually present at the hair peg stage, and abundantly so and quite active in the bulbous peg. At this stage (approximately postmenstrual week 15), two or three swellings appear on the posterior wall. The uppermost is the rudiment of the apocrine gland (present only in some follicles), the middle forms the sebaceous gland and the lower swelling is the bulb, to which the arrector pili muscle (arising from underlying mesenchyme) later becomes attached. The cells of the lowermost region of the bulb, the matrix, divide actively and produce a pointed hair cone. This grows upwards to canalize a developing hair tract, along which the fully formed hair, derived by further differentiation of cells advancing from the matrix, reaches the surface at approximately postmenstrual week 18. The hair of the scalp lengthens during postmenstrual weeks 25–28, and the eyebrow hairs and eyelashes are well developed.</div><div class="text" id="p0590">Sebaceous glands develop independently of hair follicles in the nostrils, eyelids (as tarsal glands) and the anal region. Apocrine sweat glands are formed at the same time as eccrine (merocrine) sweat glands and are at first widely distributed over the body. Their number diminishes from about postmenstrual week 20, producing the distribution seen in adult skin, and they become active at this time. The sebum that is created blends with the desquamated epidermal cells to form a cheesy covering over the skin, the vernix caseosa, which is usually considered to protect the skin from maceration by the amniotic fluid.</div><div class="text" id="p0595">Hairs produced prenatally are called lanugo hairs, which are short and downy, lack a medulla, and in certain parts of the body are arranged in a vortex-like manner into tracts (<a href="#bib8" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_8">Domagala et al 2017</a>). During postmenstrual weeks 21–24 (6 months), the lanugo darkens, the vernix caseosa is more abundant and the skin becomes markedly wrinkled. Throughout the remaining postmenstrual weeks, there is a progressive loss of lanugo, except for the hairs on the eyelids (eyelashes), eyebrows and scalp. Just prior to birth, lanugo hairs are replaced by vellus hairs, and these are replaced in turn by intermediate hairs, which are the predominant type until puberty. New follicles do not develop in postnatal skin.</div></section><section><a id="s0255"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0255">Eccrine sweat glands</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0600">Eccrine (merocrine) sweat glands are one type of sudoriferous gland. Sweat gland rudiments appear late in the first trimester as cell buds associated with the primary epidermal ridges of the finger and toe pads of the terminal segments of the digits. They elongate into the dermis and by postmenstrual week 16 the lower portion begins to form the secretory coil; secretory and myoepithelial cells are present within the secretory coil by postmenstrual week 22. The solid cord of cells connecting the coil to the epidermis becomes the intradermal duct, and the lumina of both are formed by dissolution of desmosomal contacts between the cells. The intraepidermal duct is foreshadowed by a column of concentrically arranged inner and outer cells within which a lumen is formed that opens on the surface at postmenstrual week 22. As with hair follicles, no new eccrine sweat glands develop postnatally. Emotional sweating occurs in preterm infants from 29 postmenstrual weeks.</div></section><section><a id="s0260"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0260">Epidermal ridges</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0605">The primary epidermal ridges develop as regularly spaced, small downgrowths of epidermal cells separated by corresponding dermal ridges during the second and third months of gestation.

They progressively reach a dorsal position, where, at approximately postfertilization week 9, a flattened nail field limited by proximal, distal and lateral nail grooves is apparent. The nail field ultimately forms the nail bed, and the primordium of the nail is formed of a wedge of cells that grows diagonally, proximally and deeply into the mesenchyme from the proximal groove towards the underlying terminal phalanx. The deeper cells of this wedge form the primordium of the matrix, which gives rise to the nail plate. The latter emerges from under the now proximal nail fold at about postmenstrual week 14 and grows distally over an already keratinized nail bed. The nail matrix is usually considered to have dorsal and ventral (intermediate) components, but there are conflicting opinions as to the extent to which each contributes to the nail, both in ontogeny and postnatally. It is generally agreed that the ventral matrix contributes the major part.</div><div class="text" id="p0615">At postmenstrual week 20, the nail plate entirely covers the nail field (nail bed), now limited distally by a distal ridge, which, when the plate projects beyond the tip, becomes the hyponychium beneath it.

The mesenchymal cells underlying the surface ectoderm and early bi- and trilaminar epidermis contact each other by slender processes to form an intercommunicating network. They secrete a matrix that is rich in ions, water and macromolecules, proteoglycan/glycosaminoglycans, fibronectin, collagenous proteins of various types and elastin. Further development of these intrinsic components involves the differentiation of individual cell types, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, mast cells and the assembly of matrix components into organized fibrillar collagen fibres and elastic fibres. During embryogenesis, the matrix is heterogeneous with regard to its biochemical and macromolecular components. The main glycosaminoglycans of embryonic and fetal skin are glycuronic acid and dermatan sulphate. Types I, III, V and VI collagens are distributed more or less uniformly, regardless of fetal age, with some local concentrations of type III and V collagens, the levels of which are higher than in postnatal skin. Collagens of types IV and VII are found predominantly in the BMZ.</div><div class="text" id="p0625">The progressive morphological differentiation of the dermis involves its separation from the subcutis at about the end of the first trimester; changes in the composition and size of collagen fibrils and their organization into bundles, amongst which cells become relatively fewer; downgrowth of epidermal appendages; the organization of nervous and vascular plexuses; and the relatively late appearance of elastic networks. The papillary and reticular regions are present as early as postmenstrual week 14 and the formation of the two layers of the dermis could be the result of two lineages of dermal fibroblasts (<a href="#bib9" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_9">Driskell et al 2013</a>).

Closed channels lined with endothelium and containing nucleated red cells are present by about postfertilization week 6 underneath the ectoderm, and by postfertilization week 8 are arranged in a single plane parallel to the epidermis: they ultimately form the subpapillary plexus. A second, deeper horizontal plexus is evident by postmenstrual weeks 12–13. Both plexuses extend by budding and give rise to the final patterns of arterioles, venules and capillaries that are established shortly after birth. Pericytes also develop from mesenchymal cells. Lymphatic vessels are formed by mesenchymal cells, which become organized to enclose pools of proteinaceous fluid leaking from the developing capillaries.</div></section><section><a id="s0280"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0280">Innervation</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0635">Sensory cutaneous nerves (axons and Schwann cells) are derived from the neural crest (via dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia).

Fingerprint ridge patterns can be separated into three major types (see <a href="#f0180">Fig. 7.35</a>): arches (5%), loops (70%) and whorls (25%). Arches have no tri-radii, loops have one tri-radius, and whorls have two or more.

Type A, Futcher's or Voigt's lines, are the most common and occur along the anterior axial lines, extending from the sternum to the wrist, delineating the darker extensor and paler flexor surfaces of the arms.</div></section><section><a id="s0325"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0325">Lines detectable after manipulation or incision</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0725">In certain regions of the body, surgical wounds heal with a better and less conspicuous scar if they are orientated in a particular direction. This finding is related to a number of factors including skin tension and naturally formed wrinkle lines. Skin is normally under tension; the direction in which the tension is greatest varies regionally. Tension is dependent on the protrusion of underlying structures, the direction of underlying muscles, and on joint movements. Many anatomists and surgeons have therefore attempted to produce a body map to indicate the best direction in which to make an elective incision to obtain the most aesthetic scar. These maps frequently differ, especially in the region of the face. Out of the multitude of described cleavage lines, the most commonly referred to are relaxed skin tension lines (RSTLs), Langer's lines and Kraissl's lines (see <a href="../B9780702077050000367/B9780702077050000367.xhtml#f0010">Fig. 36.1</a>). Of these, the RSTLs and Kraissl's lines are probably more appropriate lines for surgical incision.</div><section><a id="s0330"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0330">Relaxed skin tension lines</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0730">Relaxed skin tension lines (RSTLs) are those that correspond to the directional pull (which forms furrows) when the skin is relaxed; they do not always correspond to wrinkle lines. The tension across RSTLs is constant even during sleep, but can be altered (increased, decreased or abolished) by underlying muscle contraction. The direction of the RSTLs can be determined by pinching the skin in different directions. Pinching at right-angles to the RSTLs will result in fewer and higher furrows than pinching parallel to these lines.</div></section><section><a id="s0335"/><h5 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0335">Blaschko's lines</h5><div class="textfl" id="p0735">Blaschko's lines represent a pattern of cutaneous mosaicism that can be observed in a range of congenital and acquired skin conditions.

Chronological changes are physiological or intrinsic in origin. A major environmental factor is chronic exposure to the sun, photoageing, which is to some extent preventable.</div><section><a id="s0345"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0345">Intrinsic ageing</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0745">From about the third decade onwards, gradual changes occur in the appearance, microstructure and mechanical properties of the skin as a result of epidermal and dermal atrophy. They become very marked in old age. Alterations include wrinkling, dryness, loss of elasticity, thinning and easy bruising. Epidermal atrophy is manifested by general thinning and loss of the basal rete pegs and flattening of the dermal–epidermal junction. Flattening of the junction decreases resistance to shear, leading to poor adhesion of epidermis and its separation following minor injury. The thickness of the cornified layer is not reduced in old age, and its permeability characteristics seem little affected. Epidermal proliferative activity and rate of cell replacement decline with age, being reduced by up to 50% in elderly skin. Synthesis of vitamin D is also reduced. After middle age, there is a 10–20% decline in the number of melanocytes, and Langerhans cells become sparser, a change associated with a reduction in immune responsiveness. Depigmentation and loss of hair, as well as some local increases (eyebrows, nose and ears in males, and face and upper lip in females), are commonly observed. Alterations in non-keratinocytes may be aggravated by chronic exposure to UV irradiation.</div><div class="text" id="p0750">Dermal changes are mainly responsible for the appearance of aged skin, particularly its stiffness, flaccidity and wrinkling, as well as loss of extensibility and elasticity. Its general, thickness diminishes as a result of the decline in collagen synthesis by a reduced population of fibroblasts, though the relative proportion of type III collagen increases. Senile elastosis is a degenerative condition of collagen, which may be partly due to excessive exposure to sun. Vascularization of the skin is reduced, the capillary loops of the dermal papillae are particularly affected, and the tendency towards small spontaneous purpuric haemorrhages indicates a general fragility of the cutaneous microvasculature. There is a decrease in the sensitivity of sensory perception, associated with some loss of specialized receptors. Ageing is also associated with fat redistribution, which may contribute to the physical characteristics of loose, sagging skin.</div></section><section><a id="s0350"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0350">Photoageing</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0755">Skin ageing is also influenced by external factors, such as tobacco exposure, malnutrition, airborne particulate matter and UV radiation. Photoageing, also known as extrinsic skin ageing, occurs as a result of the hazardous effect of UV radiation on human skin, and is a major concern because of an association with skin cancer. Ultraviolet light B (UVB) is primarily absorbed in the epidermis and has been shown to induce angiogenesis and lymphatic dysfunction in skin. It causes DNA damage by generating cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts, all of which are photocarcinogenic. Ultraviolet A is absorbed by cellular chromophores such as melanin, riboflavin and urocanic acid, resulting in the formation of reactive oxygen species, which in turn damage lipids, DNA and proteins (<a href="#bib33" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_33">Schuch et al 2017</a>).</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s0355"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0355">Cutaneous Wound Healing and Scarring</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0760">The end-point of healing of mammalian skin wounds is usually scar formation. This type of healing is called reparative wound healing as opposed to regenerative wound healing which can be seen in lower animals (such as the newt), where wounds can heal without scarring and with functional skin appendages.</div><div class="text" id="p0765">Cutaneous scars result from injury to both the epidermis and the underlying dermis. The epidermis largely regenerates, but dermal architecture is abnormal after repair and the undulating pattern of rete ridges at the dermal–epidermal junction is not reproduced. Scar tissue is biomechanically inferior to unwounded skin. Appendages such as hair follicles, sebaceous and sweat glands, which are derived from the epidermis, do not regenerate after wounding.</div><div class="text" id="p0770">The molecular biology of cutaneous repair involves the coordination of numerous cell types, signalling molecules and matrix proteins. Many of these signalling molecules have pleiotropic effects and it is the complex balance of these mediators, rather than their individual action, that determines events in wound repair. Wound healing is often considered in four overlapping temporal phases, haemostasis, inflammation, proliferation and remodelling (<a href="#f0185"><span class="bold">Fig. 7.36</span></a>) (<a href="#bib23" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_23">Landén et al 2016</a>).</div><section><a id="s0360"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0360">Haemostasis</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0775">Haemostasis occurs within minutes to hours of injury. Wounding causes vascular injury and initiates fibrin–fibronectin clot formation. The clot <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="163" id="pagebreak_163"/>consists of platelets (promoted to aggregate by fibrillar collagens type I and III) embedded in a mesh of cross-linked fibrin and fibronectin fibres. It serves as a haemostatic plug, protects the denuded wound with a temporary physical shield, and provides an initial wound bed that allows the surrounding fibroblasts to start laying down new collagen and extracellular matrix proteins to form the neodermis. The clot also acts as a reservoir of growth factors and cytokines that are released as platelets degranulate, and that contribute to inflammatory cell recruitment.</div></section><section><a id="s0365"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0365">Inflammation</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0780">The inflammatory phase of wound healing occurs within the first 72 hours of injury and serves mainly to clear bacteria and debris from the wound and to prepare the wound bed for repair. Neutrophils and monocytes are recruited to wound sites within minutes of injury by a variety of chemotactic signals, including complement factors, bacterial polysaccharides, cytokines and growth factors such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-8, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α) and TGF-β1,2, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF/FGF-2), serotonin and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). Complement, thrombin and mast cell mediators cause vasodilatation of the local capillaries and increase blood flow to facilitate the migration of inflammatory cells. Neutrophils are active against contaminating bacteria. Monocytes differentiate into macrophages that phagocytose not only pathogenic organisms, but also expended neutrophils, and cellular and matrix debris. Neutrophils and macrophages act as a source of cytokines and growth factors that amplify stimuli already present in the wound site. Macrophages are also a source of actors such as TGF-α, FGF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that activate resident fibroblasts, endothelial cells and keratinocytes, which, in turn, are central to the processes of re-epithelialization and formation of granulation tissue.</div></section><section><a id="s0370"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0370">Proliferation</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0785">The proliferative phase occurs in the first 2–3 weeks, and involves continued re-epithelialization and the formation of granulation tissue to fill the defects caused by the wound.</div><section><a id="s0375"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0375">Re-epithelialization</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0790">Re-epithelialization begins within hours of wounding as a result of keratinocyte migration and proliferation from the wound edges and skin appendages. Cytokines such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), FGF, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF/FGF-7), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and TGF-α are released by activated fibroblasts and keratinocytes, and stimulate the re-epithelialization process. Advancing keratinocytes are capable of debriding the wound surface through phagocytosis of debris and dead cells and keratinocyte expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) appears to be associated with re-epithelialization. During this phase of cutaneous wound healing, keratinocyte proliferation is thought to be upregulated after migration has started; dividing and migrating cells are found in the first suprabasal as well as basal keratinocyte layers. MMP activity is regulated by the production of tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs). A relative imbalance between MMPs and TIMPs, e.g. upregulation of certain MMPs, may be associated with impaired wound healing. When the denuded wound surface has been covered by a monolayer of keratinocytes, migration ceases. A stratified epidermis with an underlying basal lamina is re-established from the margins of the wound inwards. Anchoring fibrils linking the basal lamina to the underlying connective tissue mark neo-epidermal maturity.

It contains numerous capillaries that invade the initial wound clot and become <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="164" id="pagebreak_164"/><a id="pg164"/>organized into a microvascular network (angiogenesis), together with the cells and molecules necessary to stimulate neo-matrix deposition. Angiogenesis starts 2 days after injury and is a complex process, promoted by dynamic interactions between endothelial cells, angiogenic cytokines (including FGF-2), VEGF (mainly from keratinocytes), PDGF and TGF-β1,2, MMP and the extracellular matrix environment.</div><div class="text" id="p0800">Electron microscopic studies have shown that the epidermis, basal lamina and papillary dermis all develop on the surface of the granulation tissue. Wounds that fail to granulate do not heal satisfactorily, suggesting that granulation tissue formation is a key aspect of wound repair. Excessive granulation is also associated with delayed re-epithelialization.</div><div class="text" id="p0805">Activated fibroblasts in the healing wound proliferate in response to growth factors, notably TGF-β1, IGF-1, PDGF, FGF and EGF. Within 72 hours of injury, these fibroblasts synthesize components of the new extracellular matrix, which are deposited in an orderly sequence. The neo-matrix initially includes fibronectin and hyaluronan, which form a provisional substratum for cellular migration. Fibronectin acts as an initiation site for collagen fibrillogenesis, and as anchorage for myofibroblasts to effect wound contraction. Hyaluronan forms a highly hydrated matrix that is easily penetrated by migrating cells. Ultimately this and other neo-matrix components are replaced, first by collagen type III, and subsequently by collagen type I, which imparts strength to the mature scar. Non-structural proteins such as tenascin are also found in the neo-matrix of healing wounds and provide signals that orchestrate the repair process. Cellularity decreases during the evolution of granulation tissue into a mature scar (and during other phases of wound healing), mainly as a result of apoptosis.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0385"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0385">Remodelling</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0810">Remodelling of the extracellular matrix is important throughout the wound healing process and can last for months to over a year. Fibroblasts are responsible for matrix deposition and remodelling. Initially they replace hyaluronan in the neo-matrix with sulphated proteoglycans, such as decorin, biglycan and versican, which contribute to tissue resilience. Increased wound strength coincides with new collagen deposition. Approximately 3 weeks after injury, collagen breakdown and synthesis equilibrate; subsequent, more gradual increases in wound strength reflect collagen remodelling, with the formation of intermolecular cross-links and larger collagen bundles. Scar maturation is associated with proportional increases in collagen type I relative to collagen type III, associated with more organized orientation of the collagen fibrils. Scarred skin only reaches a maximum tensile strength of about 70% that of unwounded skin.</div><section><a id="s0390"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0390">Wound contraction</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0815">An important part of remodelling is wound contraction. Once granulation tissue has been laid down, a proportion of activated fibroblasts (or other mesenchymal cells) transform into myofibroblasts, which play a key role in wound contraction; they are thought to generate forces that pull normal dermal and adipose tissue into the wound defect.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0395"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0395">Scarless wound healing</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0820">Wounds heal with reduced or absent scarring in certain circumstances, notably cutaneous wounds in the early fetus. The transition from scarless to scarring healing is seen at 24 weeks of gestation. The development of a major inflammatory response at a wound site appears to be a significant determinant of whether scarring occurs. Scarless fetal wound healing is characterized by fewer inflammatory cells (which are less differentiated than their adult counterparts and which remain in the wound for a shorter time), rapid re-epithelialization, reduced angiogenesis and restoration of the connective tissue architecture in which collagen is arranged in the normal reticular pattern. Fetal healing is characterized by low levels of IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β1 and TGF-β2, and high levels of IL-10 and TGF-β3. TGF-β1 and 2 are produced from degranulating platelets and subsequently from monocytes and macrophages: the low levels of TGF-β1 seen in fetal wounds have been attributed to a relative lack of platelet degranulation and fibrin clot formation. The main sources of TGF-β3 are fibroblasts and keratinocytes.</div></section><section><a id="s0400"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0400">Excessive scar formation</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0825">In some individuals, collagenous scar tissue forms which covers a greater area than the original wound, forming a keloid scar or keloid. This is an area of raised, hairless skin overlying the site of a wound which may have been relatively minor. Keloids are more common in darker-pigmented skins, on the upper body and in those with a familial history of keloid formation.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0405"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0405">Skin Grafts and Flaps</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0830">A graft is a piece of tissue that has been detached from its blood supply and therefore needs to regain a blood supply from the bed in which it is placed in order to survive. A flap is a piece of tissue that is surgically raised and transferred from one location in the body to another while maintaining its blood supply.</div><section><a id="s0410"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0410">Grafts</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0835">Grafts can be composed of skin, fat, fascia or bone, either separately or together as a composite piece of tissue. Skin grafts can be either full-thickness grafts or split-thickness grafts. Full-thickness grafts consist of the epidermis and the full thickness of the dermis. Split-thickness grafts consist of the epidermis and a variable quantity of the dermis. An essential difference is that the donor site following the harvest of a full-thickness graft has no epidermal elements from which new skin can regenerate. These grafts therefore tend to be taken from sites of the body where the donor defect can be primarily closed. The donor site from split-thickness grafting contains adnexal remnants (hair follicles in particular), that have the propensity to divide and regenerate new epidermis, and so resurface the donor defect.</div><div class="text" id="p0840">Revascularization of grafts is dependent on early and direct connection between host and graft vessels (inosculation); in the time that elapses before this occurs, graft survival depends on fluid absorption (imbibition). Revascularization, which occurs as early as 48 hours post-transplantation, is achieved by anastomosis, where the severed ends of pre-existing graft vessels are sutured to vessels of the underlying host wound bed, and/or by neovascularization, which involves the <span class="italic">de novo</span> angiogenic ingrowth of vessels from the wound bed into the graft. During the first two weeks, blood vessels from the recipient (host) site invade the graft edges along previous vascular channels in the direction of an ischaemic stimulus, while the donor graft vasculature begins to regress. Endothelial progenitor cells appear to play an important role in blood vessel formation, attracted by ischaemic gradients. Inosculation occurs, restoring blood flow to the graft microcirculation. By the start of the third week, complete blood flow in the graft vasculature has been established and, in the absence of a continuing ischaemic stimulus, neovascularization ends.</div></section><section><a id="s0415"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0415">Flaps</h3><div class="textfl" id="p0845">Flaps are named according to the type of tissue transferred, e.g. a fasciocutaneous flap contains skin and fascia, and a musculocutaneous flap contains both muscle and the overlying skin, whereas a skin flap, fascial flap and muscle flap contain only the separate elements that their names imply. The blood supply to a skin flap can be randomly orientated, which limits the flap length-to-breadth proportions to no more than 2<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>:<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>1 (except on the face, where longer flaps can be performed). Much longer skin flaps can be raised elsewhere if the blood supply to the flap is a direct cutaneous artery and vein (axial pattern flaps) and are usually based on the local angiosome. An angiosome is an anatomical territory supplied by a source artery and drained by accompanying veins and lymphatic vessels (<a href="#bib36" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_36">Taylor et al 2011</a>) (see <a href="../B9780702077050000069/B9780702077050000069.xhtml#pg135">p. 135</a>). It may include fascia, nerve, muscle and bone, as well as skin. The concept is important in the analysis of patterns of ischaemia and in planning incisions, and enables the raising of free, composite, vascularized tissue flaps.</div><div class="text" id="p0850">A free flap (free tissue transfer) is a specific type of flap in which the tissue, whether skin, fascia, muscle or bone, or a combination of these, is completely removed from its original location in the body along with a single identifiable artery and vein, and transferred to a remote site. The blood vessels in the flap are anastomosed to vessels located in the new site using microsurgical techniques. This often allows for greater flexibility in performing reconstructive surgery.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0420"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0420">Skin Stem Cells</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0855">To maintain, repair and regenerate itself, the skin contains stem cells that reside in various parts of the hair follicles, including the bulge area and isthmus; the basal layer of the interfollicular epidermis; the base <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="165" id="pagebreak_165"/><a id="pg165"/>of sebaceous glands and within sweat glands. Epidermal stem cells are able to self-renew, as well as give rise to differentiating cells. However, it is not clear whether every basal keratinocyte, or only a proportion of these cells, is a stem cell. Two hypotheses have emerged concerning epithelial renewal. One theory, known as symmetric cell division, envisages basal keratinocytes within epidermal proliferation units that contain one self-renewing stem cell and about 10 tightly packed transit amplifying cells, each of which is capable of dividing a limited number of times before exiting the basal layer to undergo terminal differentiation. This unit gives rise to a column of larger and flatter cells that culminates in a single hexagonal surface. The alternative theory, known as asymmetric cell division, is that some interfollicular stem cells (perhaps up to 70% of cells) can shift their spindle orientation from lateral to perpendicular, such that one daughter cell is committed to terminal differentiation while the other maintains its proliferative capacity, thus obviating the need for transit amplifying cells.</div><div class="text" id="p0860">Hair follicle stem cells are found in the bulge regions below the sebaceous glands but also in other parts of the hair follicle (<a href="#bib15" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_15">Fuchs 2018</a>). These stem cells undergo varying degrees of growth, degeneration and rest, which are governed, in part, by Wnt signalling and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibition. The bulge area stem cells generate cells of the outer root sheath, which drive the highly proliferative matrix cells next to the mesenchymal papillae. After proliferating, matrix cells differentiate to form the hair channel, the inner root sheath and the hair shaft. Hair follicle stem cells can also differentiate into sebocytes and interfollicular epidermis. Despite this multipotency, the follicle stem cells only function in pilosebaceous unit homeostasis and do not contribute to the interfollicular epidermis unless the skin is wounded. Stem cells are also found in the base of sebaceous glands: their progeny differentiate into lipid-filled sebocytes. Stem cells in sweat glands can differentiate into epithelial, luminal or myoepithelial daughter cells to maintain skin integrity and homeostasis.</div><div class="text" id="p0865">Other cells in the dermis and subcutis may have stem cell-like properties. Dermal sheath cells lie close to hair follicles; MUSE (multi-lineage differentiating stress-enduring) cells are pluripotent progenitor cells. Trauma and/or hypoxia in the skin, e.g. during wound healing or skin grafting, may induce recruitment of epithelial and endothelial progenitors from stem cell sources beyond the skin, such as the bone marrow, predominantly from the mesenchymal stromal cell pool; this is an area of much debate and current research.</div></section></section><footer><section role="doc-bibliography"
