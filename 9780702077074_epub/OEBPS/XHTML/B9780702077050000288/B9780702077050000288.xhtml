Some brainstem cell groups are the nuclei of cranial nerves and are concerned with the sensory, motor and autonomic innervation of the head and neck. Others give rise to autonomic (visceromotor) fibres that are distributed widely within the thorax and abdomen via branches of the vagus nerve. The brainstem also contains the reticular formation, a complex and sometimes ill-defined network of neurones that extends throughout its length, and is continuous caudally with its spinal counterpart (<a href="#bib56" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_56">Olszewski and Baxter 1954</a>, <a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_26">Haines and Mihailo 2018</a>). Some reticular nuclei are referred to as vital centres because they are concerned with regulation of cardiac and respiratory activities; other parts of the reticular formation are essential for cerebral cortical arousal and the maintenance of consciousness, or are involved in the regulation of muscle tone, posture and reflex activities. The brainstem is the site of origin and/or termination of numerous ascending and descending fibres and is traversed by many others. The anterolateral system (spinal lemniscus), medial lemniscus and the trigeminothalamic tracts all ascend through the brainstem to reach the thalamus. Prominent corticospinal projections descend through the brainstem and corticonuclear projections end within it.</div><div class="text" id="p0020">Because the brainstem is so compact, structurally and functionally, even small lesions can destroy vital centres, disconnect forebrain motor areas from motor neurones in the brainstem and spinal cord, and sever incoming sensory fibres from higher centres of consciousness, perception and cognition. Clinically, irreversible cardiac and respiratory arrest often follows complete destruction of the respiratory and cardiac centres in the medulla. Damage to substantial portions of the reticular system bilaterally may cause coma. Damage to the ventral pons bilaterally may cause the ‘locked in’ syndrome, where interruption of motor function causes total paralysis and inability to speak, despite maintenance of consciousness. Accurate anatomical knowledge of brainstem anatomy is essential to reach a correct diagnosis and determine proper patient management.</div><section><a id="s0010"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0020">Overview of Cranial Nerves and Their Nuclei</h2><div class="textfl" id="p0025">The cranial nerves are the routes by which the brain receives information directly from, and controls the functions of, structures that are located mainly, although not exclusively, within the head and neck. All but three of the 12 pairs of cranial nerves are regarded as being attached to the brainstem, the exceptions being the olfactory, optic and accessory nerves.</div><div class="text" id="p0030">The 12 pairs of cranial nerves are individually named and are numbered (using Roman numerals) from rostral to caudal, reflecting the order in which they emerge from the brain (see <a href="../B9780702077050000240/B9780702077050000240.xhtml#t0010">Table 24.1</a>). The olfactory nerve (I) arises from the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity (see <a href="../B9780702077050000392/B9780702077050000392.xhtml#f0055">Fig. 39.13</a>) and terminates directly in cortical and subcortical areas of the frontal and temporal lobes; it is closely associated functionally with the limbic system and is described in that context. The axons of the optic nerve (II) pass into the optic chiasma, where medially positioned axons decussate; all of the axons emerge as the optic tract, which terminates in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (the visual pathways are discussed in <a href="../B9780702077050000458/B9780702077050000458.xhtml">Chapter 45</a>). The oculomotor (III) and trochlear (IV) nerves arise in, and emerge from the midbrain. The trigeminal nerve (V) emerges from the pons, medial to the middle cerebellar peduncle. The abducens (VI), facial (VII) and vestibulocochlear (VIII) nerves emerge from the brainstem at, or close to, the pontomedullary junction. The glossopharyngeal (IX), vagus (X), cranial accessory (XI<sub>cr</sub>) and hypoglossal (XII) nerves all emerge from the medulla. The spinal accessory nerve (XI<sub>sp</sub>) arises from cervical levels C1–C5/C6.</div><div class="text" id="p0035">The accessory nerve is conventionally described as having a cranial root composed of a variable number of small rootlets that emerge from the postolivary groove of the dorsolateral medulla, caudal to the rootlets of the vagus, and a spinal root composed of fibres derived from the cervical segments of the spinal cord. The cranial rootlets carry axons of motor neurones located in the caudal part of the nucleus ambiguus, and the spinal rootlets carry axons of motor neurones located in a nucleus in the ventral horn of the cervical spinal cord in line with the nucleus ambiguus. The spinal root ascends the vertebral canal and enters the skull via the foramen magnum. The cranial and spinal roots join, either before or within the jugular foramen, and the bundle so formed then divides into internal and external branches on leaving the jugular foramen. The internal branch joins the vagus nerve and its fibres innervate branchiomeric muscles via the pharyngeal and laryngeal branches of the vagus nerve. The external branch descends into the neck to innervate sternocleidomastoid and the upper and middle fibres of trapezius. There is an alternative view that the cranial root is anatomically and functionally part of the vagus nerve, and that the spinal root is the <span class="italic">de facto</span> accessory nerve. Paradoxically, meticulous cadaveric dissection studies, often undertaken stereomicroscopically, have failed to reach a consensus, finding either no connections between rootlets arising from the dorsolateral medulla and the spinal root of the accessory nerve because the cranial root was absent, or significant variations in the arrangement and size of plexiform connections between the cranial rootlets and the spinal root. Plexiform interconnections between neighbouring cranial nerves are not uncommon and are certainly not confined to the accessory and vagus nerves (<a href="#bib64" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_64">Shoja et al 2014</a>); their functional significance is often uncertain.

The restiform body lies dorsolaterally in the medulla, forming a rounded ridge between the caudal part of the fourth ventricle and the glossopharyngeal and vagal rootlets on each side. It contains a wide variety of fibres (dorsal spinocerebellar, cuneocerebellar, olivocerebellar, reticulocerebellar and other cerebellar afferents). The restiform bodies on the two sides diverge and incline to enter the cerebellar hemispheres as the major component of the inferior cerebellar peduncles. Rostrally, in the open portion of the medulla, the dorsal surface of the medulla is demarcated from medial to lateral by the hypoglossal trigone, the sulcus limitans, the vagal trigone, the medullary vestibular area containing portions of the medial and inferior vestibular nuclei, and the dorsal aspect of the inferior cerebellar peduncle. The area postrema lies just inferior to the vagal trigone. The lateral recess of the fourth ventricle opens into the cerebellopontine angle cistern through the lateral aperture of Luschka and conveys a tuft of choroid plexus into the cistern.

Caudal regions of the nuclei receive afferents from the most caudal dorsal root ganglia (i.e. nucleus gracilis from sacral and nucleus cuneatus from mid-thoracic ganglia) and rostral regions receive afferents from the most rostral dorsal root ganglia (i.e. nucleus gracilis from lower thoracic and nucleus cuneatus from cervical ganglia) (<a href="#bib22" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_22">Ferraro and Barrera 1935</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0125">The upper regions of both nuclei are reticular and contain small and large multipolar neurones with long dendrites. The lower regions contain clusters of large, round neurones with short and profusely branching dendrites. Upper and lower zones differ in their connections but both receive terminals from the dorsal spinal roots at all levels. Dorsal funicular fibres from neurones in the spinal grey matter are components of the postsynaptic dorsal column system and terminate only in the superior, reticular zone. Variable ordering and overlap of terminals, on the basis of spinal root levels, occur in both zones. The lower extremity is represented medially, the trunk ventrally and the digits dorsally. There is modal specificity, i.e. lower levels respond to low-threshold cutaneous stimuli, and upper reticular levels to inputs from fibres serving receptors in the skin, joints and muscles. The nucleus cuneatus is divided into several zones. Its middle zone contains a large pars rotunda, in which rostrocaudally elongated, medium-sized neurones are clustered between bundles of densely myelinated fibres.

The pars triangularis is smaller and laterally placed.</div><div class="text" id="p0130">The pattern of termination of cutaneous afferents is apparently somtatotopically organized for the pars rotunda and more diffuse in the reticular poles. Unit recording of the neurones in the dorsal column nuclei shows that their tactile receptive fields (i.e. the skin area in which a response can be elicited) vary in size. Especially small receptive fields appear to account for the great sensitivity found in the digits, the face and the lips. Some fields have excitatory centres and inhibitory surrounds, which means that stimulation just outside its excitatory field inhibits the neurone. In general, sensory modal specificity is high. Many cells receive input from one or a few specific receptor types, e.g. hair, type I and II slowly adapting receptors, and Pacinian corpuscles. Some cells respond to Ia muscle spindle input, or receive convergent input from tactile pressure and hair follicle receptors. Primary spinal afferents synapse directly onto multipolar neurones in nuclei that provide the major nuclear efferent projections. The nuclei also contain interneurones, many of which are inhibitory.</div><div class="text" id="p0135">A variety of control mechanisms can modulate the transmission of impulses through the dorsal column–medial lemniscus pathway. Descending afferents from the somatosensory cortex reach the nuclei through the corticonuclear tracts, and appear to be restricted to the upper reticular zones.

Those from the circumvallate and foliate papillae of the posterior third of the tongue, tonsils, palate and pharynx (which travel via the lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve) are distributed diffusely throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the nucleus, predominantly rostral to the obex.

Other ascending paths may end in hypothalamic nuclei that mediate the flow of gustatory information to the limbic system to facilitate appropriate autonomic responses.

Afferent fibres that convey pain, temperature and light touch from the orofacial region enter the brainstem at the pons and course dorsomedially towards the principal sensory nucleus: before reaching the nucleus, approximately 50% of the fibres divide into ascending and descending branches, and the remainder ascend or descend without division. The descending trigeminal fibres form the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, which courses along the lateral border of the spinal nucleus from the midpons to the C2 level, where it becomes continuous with the the dorsal tract of Lissauer (<a href="#bib70" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_70">Waite and Ashwell 2012</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0280">The great majority of the fibres are less than 4<span style=" padding-top:0.3em; padding-left:0.2em" title="hsp=&#34;0.2&#34;"><span style="font-size:0pt"> </span></span>μm in diameter.

All of these fibres synapse in the pars caudalis of the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve.</div><div class="text" id="p0285">The structure of the pars caudalis is analogous to that of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, with a similar arrangement of cell laminae (subnuclei zonalis, gelatinosus and magnocellularis). Cutaneous nociceptive afferents and small-diameter muscle afferents terminate in layers I, II, V and VI of the pars caudalis. Low-threshold mechanosensitive afferents of Aβ neurones terminate in layers III and IV of the pars caudalis and in the rostral (interpolaris, oralis, principal sensory) nuclei. Many of the neurones in the pars caudalis that respond to cutaneous or tooth-pulp stimulation are also excited by stimulation of jaw or tongue muscles, indicating convergence of superficial and deep afferent inputs via wide-dynamic-range or nociceptive-specific neurones. Similar convergence of superficial and deep inputs occurs in the rostral parts of the trigeminal nucleus, which may account for the poor localization of trigeminal pain, and for the spread of pain, which often makes diagnosis difficult.</div><div class="text" id="p0290">Cells in lamina II of the pars caudalis also receive afferents from the sensorimotor cortex, the periaqueductal grey matter, the nucleus raphe magnus and the reticular formation. The nucleus raphe magnus projects directly to the pars caudalis, probably via enkephalin, noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin)-containing terminals. These fibres directly, or indirectly through local interneurones, influence pain perception. Stimulation of periaqueductal grey matter or nucleus raphe magnus inhibits the jaw-opening reflex to nociception, and may induce primary afferent depolarization in tooth-pulp afferents and other nociceptive facial afferents. Neurones in the pars caudalis can be suppressed by stimuli applied outside their receptive field, particularly by noxious stimuli. The pars caudalis is an important site for relay of nociceptive input and functions as part of the pain ‘gate control’. However, rostral nuclei may also have a nociceptive role as tooth-pulp afferents via wide-dynamic-range and nociceptive-specific neurones terminate in rostral nuclei, which all project to the subnucleus caudalis.</div><div class="text" id="p0305">Other afferents to the spinal nucleus arise from the dorsal roots of the upper cervical nerves.

From the thalami, third-order neurones project to the cortical postcentral gyrus (Brodmann areas 3, 1, 2). Other afferent fibres from the pars caudalis, especially from laminae I, V and VI, project to the rostral trigeminal nuclei, cerebellum, periaqueductal grey of the midbrain, parabrachial area of the pons, the brainstem reticular formation and the spinal cord.</div><div class="text" id="p0300">There are conflicting opinions on the pattern of termination of the fibres in the spinal nucleus. It has long been held that fibres are organized rostrocaudally within the tract. According to this view, ophthalmic fibres are ventral and descend to the lower limit of the first cervical spinal segment, maxillary fibres are central and do not extend below the medulla oblongata, whilst mandibular fibres are dorsal and do not extend much below the mid-medullary level. The results of section of the spinal tract in cases of severe trigeminal neuralgia support this distribution.

Tractotomy of the spinal tract performed at a lower level can spare the perioral region, a finding that would accord with the classical ‘onion-skin’ pattern of loss of pain sensation. However, in clinical practice, the progression of anaesthesia on the face is commonly ‘divisional’ rather than strictly ‘onion-skin’ in distribution. GSA fibres subserving common sensation enter the dorsal region of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve from the glossopharyngeal, vagus and facial nerves (nervus intermedius) and synapse with cells in the caudal part of the spinal nucleus. Consequently, operative section of the dorsal part of the spinal tract results in analgesia that extends to the mucosa of the tonsillar sinus, the posterior third of the tongue and adjoining parts of the pharyngeal wall (supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve), and the cutaneous areas of the ear (supplied by the auricular branch of the vagus).</div></section></section></section><section><a id="s6115"/><section><a id="s0115"/><h3 class="h2hd" id="cesectitle0115">Medullary reflexes</h3><section><a id="s4135"/><section><a id="s0135"/><h4 class="h4hd" id="cesectitle0120">Swallowing and gag reflexes</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0320">During the normal processes of eating and drinking, the passage of food or liquid to the rear of the mouth stimulates branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve in the oropharynx and swallowing is initiated.

Coughing involves a sequence of coordinated events that produce the profound change in breathing pattern needed to expel an irritant from the lower airway. Rapid inspiration is followed by an expiratory effort against a closed glottis, the rapid generation of intrapulmonary pressure and the sudden opening of the glottis and contraction of intercostal and abdominal wall muscles, collectively producing a high-velocity flow of expired air that sweeps irritant material up towards the pharynx in a forceful exhalation (cough). Laryngeal branches of the vagus nerve carrying general visceral afferent information (with cell bodies in the inferior vagal ganglion) terminate in the nucleus of the solitary tract.

It also contains a few small neurones, which are horizontally arrayed. The superficial grey layer forms a crescentic lamina over the deeper layers and contains many small multipolar interneurones, on which cortical fibres synapse. The optic layer consists partly of fibres from the optic tract that permeate the entire anterior–posterior extent of the superficial layers with numerous collateral branches as they terminate. This arrangement provides a retinotopic map of the contralateral visual field, in which the fovea is represented anterolaterally. Retinal axons terminate in clusters from specific retinotectal neurones and as collaterals of retinogeniculate fibres. The layer also contains some large multipolar neurones.

These neurones contain iron and show increasing iron concentration with age (see <a href="#f8125">Fig. 28.18</a>). In Parkinson’s disease and related disorders, disproportionate increase in iron accumulation correlates with the clinical stage of disease and disease progression (<a href="#bib201" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_201">An et al 2018</a>, <a href="#bib73" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" id="bib_73">Xuan et al 2017</a>). Most pars reticulata neurones are inhibitory GABAergic cells.

Briefly, topographically organized striatonigral axons, some of which may be collaterals of striatopallidal axons, originate from the caudate nucleus and putamen and project to the pars reticulata. They utilize GABA and substance P or enkephalin as their neurotransmitters, and are distributed differentially in the pars reticulata: enkephalinergic axons terminate in the medial part, whereas substance P axons terminate throughout. The head of the caudate nucleus projects to the rostral third of the substantia nigra, while the putamen projects to all parts. The fibres end in axodendritic synapses. A small number of GABAergic pallidonigral fibres from the external segment of the globus pallidus end mostly in the pars reticulata. The subthalamic nucleus sends an important glutamatergic projection to the pars reticulata and to the globus pallidus. Some, predominantly glutamatergic, corticonigral fibres appear to exist, passing from precentral and postcentral gyri to neurones in the pars reticulata.</div><div class="text" id="p0840">Fibres from the SNr project rostrally to the ventral anterior and dorsomedial thalamic nuclei and to the deep (polysensory) layers of the superior colliculus. They project caudally to the pedunculopontine nucleus and brainstem reticular formation, from where impulses are relayed to neurones in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. A major connection from the striatum to the superior colliculus, via the pars reticulata, is thought to function in the control of gaze in a manner analogous to the pathway that initiates general body movement via the pallidum, thalamus and supplementary motor cortex. The uncontrolled or fixed-gaze disturbances of advanced Parkinson’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and Huntington’s disease tend to support this.</div><div class="text" id="p0845">The SNc consists of closely packed, darkly pigmented neurones, which contain neuromelanin granules.

Together with the retrorubral nucleus (A8) and the ventral tegmental area (A10), they comprise most of the dopaminergic neuronal population of the midbrain.

Principally, the rostral serotoninergic group is reciprocally interconnected rostrally with the limbic system, septum, prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus. Efferents ascend and form a large ventral and a diminutive dorsal pathway. The fibres of the ventral ascending serotoninergic pathway exit the ventral aspect of the mesencephalic raphe nuclei, and then course rostrally through the ventral tegmentum from where fibres pass to the ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra and interpeduncular nucleus. A large number of fibres then enter the fasciculus retroflexus (habenulo-interpeduncular tract) and run rostrally to innervate the habenular nucleus, intralaminar, midline, anterior, ventral and lateral dorsal thalamic nuclei, and the lateral geniculate body. The ventral ascending serotoninergic pathway enters the medial forebrain bundle in the lateral hypothalamic area and splits to pass medially and laterally. The fibres in the medial tract terminate in the mammillary body, dorsomedial, ventromedial, infundibular, anterior and lateral hypothalamic, medial and lateral preoptic, and suprachiasmatic nuclei. Those in the lateral tract take the ansa peduncularis–ventral amygdalofugal path to the amygdala, striatum and neocortex. The medial forebrain bundle carries the remaining ventral ascending serotoninergic axons into the medullary stria, stria terminalis, fornix, diagonal band, external capsule, cingulate fasciculus and medial olfactory stria, to terminate in all the structures that these systems interconnect. The ventral and dorsal pathways both originate from neurones in the dorsal and central superior raphe nuclei. The smaller dorsal ascending serotoninergic pathway is initially incorporated into the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus (of Schütz). A few fibres terminate in the central mesencephalic grey matter and posterior hypothalamus, but most continue into the medial forebrain bundle and merge with the axons of the ventral pathway, which are distributed to the same targets.</div><div class="text" id="p0895">Major afferents to the mesencephalic raphe nuclei include those from the interpeduncular nucleus (linking the limbic and serotoninergic <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" title="461" id="pagebreak_461"/><a id="pg461"/>systems); from the lateral habenular nucleus (linking the septum, preoptic hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex via the fasciculus retroflexus and the medial forebrain bundle); and from the pontine central grey matter. The ascending raphe system probably functions to moderate forebrain activities, particularly limbic, septal and hypothalamic activities. A degree of region-specific connectivity suggests that it exerts precise, as well as tonal, control.</div><div class="text" id="p0900">The caudal group projects as ventral, dorsal and intermediate spinal tracts in the ventral and lateral funiculi. These terminate respectively in the ventral horns and laminae I, II and V of the dorsal horns of all segments, and in the thoracolumbar intermediolateral sympathetic and sacral parasympathetic preganglionic cell columns. The dorsal raphe nucleus also projects to the locus coeruleus, the dorsal tegmental nucleus and most of the rhombencephalic reticular formation. Its spinal projections function as a pain control pathway that descends from a mesencephalic pain control centre located in the periaqueductal grey matter, dorsal raphe and cuneiform nuclei. The intermediate raphe–spinal projection is inhibitory and, in part, modulates central sympathetic control of cardiovascular function. The ventral raphe–spinal system excites ventral horn cells and could function to enhance motor responses to nociceptive stimuli.</div></section><section><a id="s0455"/><h4 class="h3hd" id="cesectitle0380">Medial column of reticular nuclei</h4><div class="textfl" id="p0905">The medial column of reticular nuclei is composed predominantly of neurones of medium size, although very large neurones are found in some regions, and most have processes orientated in the transverse plane. In the lower medulla the column is indistinct, and is perhaps represented by a thin lamina lateral to the raphe nuclei. However, in the upper medulla the medial column expands into the medullary gigantocellular (magnocellular) nucleus, which lies ventrolateral to the hypoglossal nucleus, ventral to the vagal nuclei and dorsal to the inferior olivary complex (see <a href="#f0095">Fig. 28.19</a>). Ascending further, the column continues as the pontine gigantocellular nucleus, which lies medially in the tegmentum. Its neurones suddenly diminish in size to form, in rostral order, the almost co-extensive caudal and oral pontine tegmental reticular nuclei. It then expands into the cuneiform nucleus and subcuneiform nucleus, before fading away in the midbrain tegmentum (<a href="#bib26" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Haines and Mihailo 2018</a>).</div><div class="text" id="p0910">The connections of the medial reticular formation suggest that the medial column is integrated into both sensory and motor pathways (<a href="#bib53" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Nieuwenhuys et al 2008</a>). Retinotectal and tectoreticular fibres relay visual information and the medial forebrain bundle transmits olfactory impulses. Within the medial column, the region above and below the abducens nucleus is designated the paramedian pontine reticular formation and corresponds to the horizontal gaze centre. Afferent inputs to the medial reticular nuclear column include the spinoreticular projections and collaterals of centrally projecting spinal trigeminal, vestibular and cochlear fibres. Spinoreticular fibres, part of the anterolateral system, arise from neurones in the intermediate grey matter of the spinal cord. They decussate in the ventral white commissure, ascend in the ventrolateral funiculus, and terminate not only at all levels of the medial column of reticular nuclei but also in the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus: the latter project directly to the striatum and neocortex.</div><div class="text" id="p0915">Efferent axons of medial reticular column neurones form a multisynaptic ascending and descending system within the column and ultimately enter the spinal cord and diencephalon.</div><div class="text" id="p0920">Descending fibres form pontine (medial) and medullary (lateral) reticulospinal tracts. Pontine reticulospinal axons arise from neurones in the caudal and oral parts of the pontine reticular nucleus, descend largely uncrossed in the ventral spinal funiculus, and terminate in spinal cord laminae VII, VIII and IX. Medullary reticulospinal axons descend bilaterally, but with an ipsilateral preponderance, to end in laminae VII, VIII, IX and X, and descend ipsilaterally to end in laminae IV, V and VI.

The zone extends caudally as the nucleus retroambiguus and descends into the spinal cord. It contains noradrenergic cell groups A1, A2, A4 and A5, and the adrenergic cell group C1. The ventrolateral reticular area is involved in cardiovascular, respiratory, vasoreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes, and in the modulation of nociception.

Fibres from the hypothalamus, periaqueductal grey matter and midbrain tegmentum mediate increased respiratory activity, raised blood pressure, tachycardia, vasodilation in skeletal muscle and renal and gastrointestinal vasoconstriction. Ascending efferents from the superficial ventrolateral area synapse on neurones of the supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei. Excitation of these neurones causes release of vasopressin from the neurohypophysis.

They receive inputs from the contralateral primary motor and sensory neocortices, and the ipsilateral cerebellar and vestibular nuclei and spinal cord (the latter through the ascending spinoreticular pathway). This system augments the dorsal and ventral spinocerebellar, cuneocerebellar, accessory cuneocerebellar and trigeminocerebellar tracts.

These patients may become decorticate with extended lower extremities and flexed, upper extremities.</div><div class="text" id="p1050">As a cerebral mass compromises the available supratentorial space and the clinical picture deteriorates, the herniation traverses the tentorial notch as a downward transtentorial (or central) herniation (<a href="#f0110">Fig. 28.23C</a>). These patients have a significantly decreased level of consciousness (some may be stuporous or in coma); breathing patterns are irregular (tachypnoea, Cheyne–Stokes); and eye movements are compromised such that the pupils are dilated and may be fixed. A state of decortication may convert to decerebrate rigidity, when all extremities are extended.</div><div class="text" id="p1055">Lesions located in the temporal lobe may expand medially, forcing the uncus and possibly the parahippocampal gyrus over the edge of the tentorium cerebelli with impingement on the midbrain (<a href="#f0110">Fig. 28.23D</a>). This is uncal herniation and may present in two forms. The midbrain injury involves structures on the side of the herniation with predictable deficits: ipsilateral pupil dilation and ophthalmoplegia, contralateral weakness of upper and lower extremities, an altered level of consciousness and hyperactive reflexes. Alternatively, the herniation may shift the midbrain to the side opposite the herniation (e.g. with herniation on the right, the midbrain shifts to the left) and it is compressed against the edge of the tentorium. In this case the dilated pupil and third nerve ophthalmoplegia are on the right, and the crus cerebri damage on the left results in a right hemiplegia; both motor deficits are on the right side. The corticospinal deficit, in this case, is a false localizing sign.</div><div class="text" id="p1060">Pressure increase in the posterior fossa, an infratentorial location, may result in herniation upwards through the tentorial notch or downwards into the foramen magnum. Upward cerebellar herniation (<a href="#f0110">Fig. 28.23E</a>) displaces the brainstem against the tentorium and into the notch with resultant symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, paralysis of upward gaze, motor deficits and altered consciousness. Extrusion of the cerebellar tonsils (<a href="#f0110">Fig. 28.23F</a>) downwards into the foramen magnum may result in damage to medullary cardiac and respiratory centres, with resultant changes in heart and respiratory rates. Both of these syndromes may constitute a medical emergency, the former due to rapidly developing hydrocephalus, the latter due to compromise of cardiac and respiratory centres.</div></section></section><section><a id="s0490"/><h2 class="h1hd" id="cesectitle0410">View to the Future</h2><div class="textfl" id="p1065">With increasing sophistication of anatomical and imaging techniques, clinician-scientists will be able to depict the anatomy of the brainstem with increasing resolution, potentially opening avenues to increased understanding of the circuitry that underlies function (<a href="#f0115"><span class="bold">Fig. 28.24</span></a>).</div><section><a id="sf0115"/><div class="pageavoid"><figure class="fig" id="f0115"><img src="../../IMAGES/B9780702077050000288/main.assets/f28-22-9780702077050.jpg" alt="image"/><figcaption class="figleg"><a id="cap0115"/><a id="fspara0115"/><span class="fignum">Fig. 28.24</span> Image comparison.

Traditional anatomical descriptions have been based on the gross anatomical appearance of the structures observed. Increasingly, however, molecular studies of embryogenesis are now revealing the key signalling molecules and pathways that initiate segment formation, establish segment boundaries, and define final segment identity and function (<a href="#f0120"><span class="bold">Fig. 28.25</span></a>) (<a href="#bib63" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">Watson et al 2019</a>). This deeper, molecular understanding of segment architecture provides the opportunity to update traditional definitions to reflect newly discovered commonalities and differences among structures that were previously considered to be single or separate units. The changes now proposed are new boundaries for the midbrain, new definitions of the pons, and a new definition of the caudal medulla that reassigns the pyramidal decussation to the C1 segment.

The oculomotor (3N), trochlear (4N) and interpeduncular (IP) nuclei are allocated to the midbrain. The decussation of the pyramids (pyx) marks the caudal end of the medulla. <span class="bold">Lower portion</span>: In the proposed new nomenclature, the same tissue is re-apportioned to accord with the patterns of expression of developmental genes. The midbrain consists of two mesomeres (m1, m2). The hindbrain consists of 12 neuromeres designated r0 through r11, and is subdivided into a rostral hindbrain (r0–r6) and a caudal hindbrain (r7–r11). The oculomotor nerve (3N) lies within m1. The abducens nerve (4N) lies within r0 (isth., isthmus), and the interpeduncular nucleus lies within r1. The pontine region comprises r3 and r4, but, by overgrowth, the pons bulges over the ventral aspect of r2 rostrally and overhangs the ventral aspect of r5 and r6 caudally, obscuring them from view. The motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (5N) lies within r2 and r3. The trapezoid body (tz) and abducens nucleus (not shown) lie within r5, and the motor nucleus of the facial nerve (7N) lies within r6. The inferior olive (IO) lies within r8–r11. The decussation of the pyramids is reassigned to an expanded C1 segment. The segments over which the developmental genes act is given just above the lower portion. In broad terms, the Hox genes define the range of r2–r11 (and also act caudally for the full length of the spinal cord). Gbx2 is expressed in the rostral hindbrain (r0, r1) but not in the midbrain. <span class="italic">Fgf8</span> is selectively expressed in the isthmus. <span class="italic">Otx2</span> distinguishes the midbrain and forebrain from the hindbrain, and Pax6 identifies the diencephalon. <br/><span class="figcredit">Reproduced with permission from Watson C, Bartholomaeus C, Puelles L 2019 Time for radical changes in brain stem nomenclature – applying the lessons from developmental gene patterns.
